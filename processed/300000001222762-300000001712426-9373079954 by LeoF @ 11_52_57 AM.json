What was your first and last name, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Scott, S-T-O-T-T, Griffith, G-R-I-F-F-I-T-H.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your zip code, Scott?\n\nSpeaker 2: 43026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Yeah, I can push that 2, 3, 4, 5, even 6 months into the future, Mr. Griffith.\n\nSpeaker 2: When did you want me to set that for?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to cancel it, but can you just make it as long as possible?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'll do that until July.\n\nSpeaker 1: If anything, if you need to call back before then, you can always push it further or get it sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you. So I get charged again when, in July, you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: July 24th, if you don't call us to change anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. That's perfect. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day. Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye.",
