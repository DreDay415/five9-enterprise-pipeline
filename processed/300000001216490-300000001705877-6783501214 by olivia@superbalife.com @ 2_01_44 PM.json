    "text": "Speaker 1: At a coffee shop, and thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Dennis Young.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Dennis, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, I love to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today, Dennis?\n\nSpeaker 1: They have automatically renewed the subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't know that it was a renewable subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I want the $130 back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't got the pills or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It said to call, I sent an email and it said to call\n\nSpeaker 2: to customer service to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Dennis, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 11-25-60.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, and you're located at 342 Almond Road,\n\nSpeaker 1: Covington, Georgia?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah, so if you don't want to receive\n\nSpeaker 1: regular refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: on hold for up to six months at a time\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work\n\nSpeaker 2: is whenever you are ready to order again,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can, you just have to give us a call\n\nSpeaker 2: to place the order when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, as far as the current shipment\n\nSpeaker 2: that's already gone out,\n\nSpeaker 1: you are in a good position\n\nSpeaker 2: because you haven't received it yet\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're gonna receive it very soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the reason I say that is\n\nSpeaker 1: that means you haven't opened it.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as you do not open it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can write return to sender on it\n\nSpeaker 2: and give it right back to your post person\n\nSpeaker 1: or hand it to the post office one or the other\n\nSpeaker 2: and say, hey, I just want this return to sender\n\nSpeaker 1: and they will bring it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we can process your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Listen to me and let me tell you what the email says.\n\nSpeaker 2: The email says that it hadn't been sent out yet\n\nSpeaker 1: and as long as I called, it would be canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And that's what, yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I do see a tracking number and it does say shipped\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't have any notes about an email.\n\nSpeaker 1: So all I can go off of is the information\n\nSpeaker 2: that it says it's been shipped to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: the tracking number and that you'll receive it\n\nSpeaker 2: by January 26th at 8 p.m., which I believe is Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Monday or Tuesday, maybe it's Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, once you receive it, as long as you don't open it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can just write return to sender on it\n\nSpeaker 2: and they'll bring it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as soon as even a few days later,\n\nSpeaker 2: we should be able to use that same tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: to confirm it's on its way back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then once we receive it, we can process your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, this is bad business.\n\nSpeaker 2: I won't buy anything else from y'all.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I didn't order it, I didn't subscribe for it,\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know it was a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's just bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's ridiculous, that's bad business.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want you to hook somebody into something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, when you place the order, it did say,\n\nSpeaker 1: as you know, it said that every order with us\n\nSpeaker 2: comes with prescription refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that if you don't want them based off\n\nSpeaker 2: of what the pharmacy decides,\n\nSpeaker 1: that you need to call this phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it shared this exact phone number for you to call,\n\nSpeaker 1: and because you didn't call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I understand your perspective.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to stop the shipment,\n\nSpeaker 2: all you gotta do is just call them and stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's already been shipped,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I can read the tracking number for you\n\nSpeaker 1: so that you can verify that that's literally not true.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they're sitting here and saying\n\nSpeaker 1: that they've got a four-week back order in my email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who says they have a four-week?\n\nSpeaker 1: Y'all's email.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to screenshot it and send it to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, yeah, if you want to do that,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can send it to support at scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because, yeah, I don't see any record of any.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is just a scam.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, to be honest with you,\n\nSpeaker 2: the quality's not there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're getting some bad reviews,\n\nSpeaker 2: I guarantee you that, because this is ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, yeah, just once you receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: as long as you don't open it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then once we receive it back,\n\nSpeaker 1: we'll process it one time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, what are you saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, so if it gets lost in the mail,\n\nSpeaker 1: which happens, especially in my part of town.\n\nSpeaker 2: If that's a concern to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can email you more extensive instructions\n\nSpeaker 2: if you want to go to the post office to do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean, go to the post office?\n\nSpeaker 2: See, y'all are costing me time and money for no reason.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we're not.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the option to just write\n\nSpeaker 1: return to sender on the package\n\nSpeaker 2: and leave it in your mailbox\n\nSpeaker 1: and your post person will bring it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't want to take that option,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you want to be.\n\nSpeaker 2: How would you feel if somebody\n\nSpeaker 1: had already taken the money out of your account\n\nSpeaker 2: and used it for something you don't want,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can't get your money back,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then if it gets lost,\n\nSpeaker 1: or y'all think you're on the way back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm offering you all of the instructions\n\nSpeaker 1: for how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You certainly can get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if anything, we actually have 120 day\n\nSpeaker 2: return and refund policy, which is very generous.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, you can certainly get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm happy to send you the directions\n\nSpeaker 1: for how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's just not true that I'm able to stop the shipment\n\nSpeaker 1: because it has already been shipped\n\nSpeaker 2: and there is a tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: that I can literally read to you for you to confirm\n\nSpeaker 2: that it's been shipped and where it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to verify that you've got a tracking number\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't believe it when you send me one email\n\nSpeaker 1: saying one thing and then you say another, it's...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Advocacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a pen and paper?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the tracking number, and it's gonna be USPS,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's 9400136207.\n\nSpeaker 1: Six, nine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nine, two.\n\nSpeaker 1: Seven, six.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two, eight.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three, two.\n\nSpeaker 2: Eight, four.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can take that number,\n\nSpeaker 2: you type it into USPS tracking.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can just Google that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can type that number directly into there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Click enter.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it will say expected delivery January 26, 8 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's currently in Atlanta, Georgia as of today.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we ship out of Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what does that mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: That means it was shipped out at least yesterday\n\nSpeaker 1: if it's already made it to Georgia.\n\nSpeaker 2: So y'all should have stopped it\n\nSpeaker 1: when I sent the email two days ago\n\nSpeaker 2: when y'all took the money out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not the email team,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I don't have any record of you emailing\n\nSpeaker 1: with the email team.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't see the email from scoreblue6port.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I read.\n\nSpeaker 1: Supporting scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: I actually have one, two, three emails from y'all.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first one's received, it's been processed.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second one's when I sent one\n\nSpeaker 2: saying I wanted it canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then the third one is they turned around\n\nSpeaker 2: and said I had to call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is stupid.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so they did not confirm.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a call, I've canceled a email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so it sounds like they did not confirm with you\n\nSpeaker 1: that the order was canceled or that they had not shipped it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, see, I'm having to pay\n\nSpeaker 1: for somebody's lack of doing their job.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't wanna wait no six months to get my money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: It certainly does not take six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you do return the lender, we should receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually within, I mean, there's a winter storm,\n\nSpeaker 1: but other than that, usually we should receive it\n\nSpeaker 2: within like 10 days and then we can process it\n\nSpeaker 1: once we receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you write down on there,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm canceling my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatever you gotta do, you put it on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they send me another one,\n\nSpeaker 2: there's gonna be a lawyer and a lawsuit.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sitting here trying to run a company\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I got people that's doing stupid stuff like this\n\nSpeaker 1: and don't do their jobs.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just, I'm done with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, do you want the more extensive instructions\n\nSpeaker 2: via email or do you just wanna do\n\nSpeaker 1: return to sender straight back to us?\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean more extensive, what do I do?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to go to the post office, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you wanna get a tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you wanna follow up with us\n\nSpeaker 2: and you wanna do that legwork to get a faster refund,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can, but it's just up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you don't have to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can just do return to sender from your house.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, it's whatever you wanna do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know if you see it on the news or not,\n\nSpeaker 2: but our post office system down here is screwed up.\n\nSpeaker 1: We got people that don't get their mail for months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't even know when I'm gonna get this,\n\nSpeaker 1: to be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I don't even use the post office no more.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's stupid to use it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like any other government facility, they're worthless.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, okay, well, here's what I'll send to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you have it, and then you have it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you have the choice.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you're-\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have my email?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, dlyoung6e at charternet.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Charter.net.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, it's .net, charter.net.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, um, I will make a note\n\nSpeaker 1: that you will be returning this recent package\n\nSpeaker 2: to the customer service team\n\nSpeaker 1: that works in emails and tracking.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll keep their eye out for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, yeah, once we receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: we'll process your refund, and your script is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send me the, what do you call it, intensive, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I sent those to you, like, a few seconds ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's three to five days after they receive it\n\nSpeaker 1: that I'll get the money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So y'all have more or less got my money for two weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or more, because of the winter storm.\n\nSpeaker 2: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: You see, you don't,\n\nSpeaker 2: I know you probably don't understand my frustration,\n\nSpeaker 1: but this is ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I run a business myself,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if somebody didn't want a product,\n\nSpeaker 2: or didn't order a product,\n\nSpeaker 1: then they would have their money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: It wouldn't be this craziness.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's, it is part of the terms of service\n\nSpeaker 1: of ordering with, it's not a scam\n\nSpeaker 2: because you agreed to the terms of service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I mentioned, you were a consenting party to this.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you did want to change the scripts,\n\nSpeaker 1: you did have the option to call us,\n\nSpeaker 2: which from your very first order,\n\nSpeaker 1: you were made aware with that phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, you know all your options.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Had that phone number, and I wasn't made aware of nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't read a whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I understand that you didn't read it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's valid.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you order something, it's that one thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't, who does a subscription?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you know, that's a thing of the past,\n\nSpeaker 1: subscribing.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's actually, if you want to talk about business, Dennis,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's every single competitor of theirs in our industry.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they all have a thing that clicks subscribe,\n\nSpeaker 2: do not subscribe, or subscribe, and that's what I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I've used more than just y'all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Tell me two of their competitors that you've used\n\nSpeaker 1: that do not offer prescription resale.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've used Pro, and had a little box.\n\nSpeaker 1: They offer prescription resale.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pro.\n\nSpeaker 1: You look up Pro, and then the other one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, they offer resales.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am extensively versed on all of their practices,\n\nSpeaker 2: and all of those offer resales.\n\nSpeaker 1: You won't listen to me, but they have a box you click\n\nSpeaker 2: to unsubscribe, to not subscribe,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you pay a little bit more.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the reason why I went with y'all\n\nSpeaker 1: is y'all didn't say you'd pay more if you didn't subscribe,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I didn't know you were,\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know that you were subscribing.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, this is all, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: this is not worth arguing about no more,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I'm just in the business for y'all anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's totally fine, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Y'all need to have that as an option on your website.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the website, it specifically states,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can read it to you, that your doctor or medical provider\n\nSpeaker 1: will most likely give you a monthly prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: a monthly subscription for your Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Our pharmacy cannot exceed the amount\n\nSpeaker 2: or dosage strength prescribed by your doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: slash medical provider.\n\nSpeaker 2: We will also follow.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we also, the customer,\n\nSpeaker 2: it says you can cancel or pause\n\nSpeaker 1: any doctor-approved pharmacy shipments at any time\n\nSpeaker 2: by calling our customer service department\n\nSpeaker 1: at 1-800-675-9807,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is the number you called to reach out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not preying on predatory lending things.\n\nSpeaker 2: So anyway, I didn't get one last month.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you're doing it monthly, what happens?\n\nSpeaker 2: We're certainly not doing it monthly,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that would not be legal,\n\nSpeaker 2: because your prescription was for 40 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we would not be able,\n\nSpeaker 2: because we are FDA approved or party tested,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we source through a real doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, that's fine, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is going nowhere.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't, I'll just do what you said about the post office\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, all right, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.",
