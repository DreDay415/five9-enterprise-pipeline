    "text": "Speaker 1: I'm messaging my supervisor.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how quickly she's going to get back to me, but I wanted to ask you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm letting her know that you're getting 40 AGV, and that time frame is every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're saying you would want to get 30 a month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would 25 a month be okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the AGV only comes in 10, 25, 40.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just going to try to set it up for every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can see about every month getting 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me ask you a question, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's just say we're talking about Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Isn't that less of a problem because of the market or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: In other words, if I were to do that instead, like switch back, how often would I be able to get 50?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because all I'm trying to do is have one a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like I'm sitting here blowing in the wind, and I'm on a noncontrolled substance,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I feel like if I wasn't with SCORE Blue, I wouldn't be doing that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anybody should be able to give me what I want because it's not a controlled substance.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or at least once a day because, you know, I'm getting less than once a day, which is really difficult for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you're talking about 40 every 60 days, that leaves me blowing in the wind for 20 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm trying to see about 25 a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that an option?\n\nSpeaker 2: But what if we forget about AAGB?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I have a suspicion that it's because it's AAGB, which is super popular,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I have the same problem when I try to prescribe stimulants for my patients.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just can't get it, and it's not because of any other reason than there's a shortage in the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I'm asking you, if I switch away from that, and I do not do AAGB anymore,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I do only Cialis, can I get like 50 every 40 days every two months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or not 50 every two months, but can I get 30 a month?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's go over the options for Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's two kinds of the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's the daily one, which is a 5 milligram, which you would take every day,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then it just accumulates in your system, and you're always ready to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is for the person who wants to be ready for intercourse every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, there's also the weekender, they call it, the other Cialis, which is a 10, 20 milligram,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that you would take for a 72-hour period.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that you would take, and it'll last you, you know, a couple days.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Viagra doesn't come, it's not recommended to take Viagra every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're looking for something you're going to be taking every day,\n\nSpeaker 2: I would say probably Cialis might be the better option, the daily one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you don't have to, it'll eliminate the stress that you have of having to take it\n\nSpeaker 2: at the right time, because you're taking it every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's one option.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what are your thoughts?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the last one I got was the 20 milligrams of Cialis, and you said,\n\nSpeaker 2: did I only order that once?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can tell you I just lost track of what I ordered once.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did I only order that once?\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you did only order that once.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait, no, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got it twice.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it twice.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what was the interval that I got it twice in?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I remember that I felt very comfortable and that I had enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got it in July.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got 50 in July of last year, July 1st, and then the 15th you got 10 Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the 22nd you got 40 Viagra, and then the 25th you got 50 more Cialis\n\nSpeaker 2: of that month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, why was I able to do that then, and now it's like I can't even do anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I honestly don't even know how you were able to do that then,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you shouldn't be taking those at the same time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I wasn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I wasn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: I switched to the other one, but I'm saying what would be the –\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I get 30, 20 milligrams Cialis every 30 days?\n\nSpeaker 1: 30, 20 milligrams Cialis every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me check.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a 90-day supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only way to do that would be to do 50, so doing the deal of the month.\n\nSpeaker 1: The deal of the month is 50 Cialis, and that would be 249.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can get that every month?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure you would get that 50 every month because, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: there's only 30 days in a month, and you wouldn't need to get 50 in a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't have to get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I honestly don't need to be on some schedule.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not trying to overuse it, but is that something where when I'm getting\n\nSpeaker 2: close to running out, I'm not going to have as much of a problem as I am\n\nSpeaker 1: having AGV because it's just – I have a feeling that AGV is just very popular,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's just harder to stock it or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'd rather have Cialis when I need it than have to really ration myself on\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't work that much better for me than Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and if you're going to be taking a Cialis every day,\n\nSpeaker 2: I recommend taking the daily.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're going to be taking something every day, the best option for you –\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm not going to take it every day, but it's just when I need it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's not every day, unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 2: At least I feel like I'm not going to worry because I'm in a constant state of\n\nSpeaker 1: panic now because I'm getting 25 or 40 days or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just not doing it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll have to go to another company, which I don't want to do,\n\nSpeaker 2: mostly because I just don't want to find some other company.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you guys, I'm highly recommended.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I've tried the 20s, and they work fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if I did the deal of the month, can I do that now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you could do that now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or did you want to place an order for the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I could also do that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to get another 25 of the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'd rather have 50 of the Atlas,\n\nSpeaker 1: because at least then I am covered for something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me look at that again.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're changing the prescription back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't want to do 40 AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to do 40 AGV, or do you want to do 50 Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess I'll do 40 AGV in that case.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I change the address?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have 3463 State Street.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to change that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's today?\n\nSpeaker 2: If I ordered it now, could I get it overnighted to State Street?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's $38 overnight shipping, but it will go out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will go out tomorrow, so it will be available?\n\nSpeaker 2: It will get there.\n\nSpeaker 1: It goes out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just hold on?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to call this other place to make sure that they can receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hold on real quick?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you hold on one second?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to call this other place to make sure that they can receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hold on real quick?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hold on?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you hold on?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to call this other place to make sure that they can receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Woah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Woah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Woah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Woah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Woah.",
