    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Terry DeCaesar. I just want to make sure that y'all have canceled any future orders sent to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let me look up your account, sir. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir. Can you verify your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6-25-1960.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I have your account pulled up here. I see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Currently, your account was set up to receive refills every month, but I want you to know that we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're actually not required to get your refills on a monthly recurring basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can actually set up your account however you want, and you can modify it at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can also put a pause on your account for up to six months at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want me to put a hold on it until July?\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatever can stop it permanently because of my medical reasons, I can't take that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah. Sorry to hear that there was a change in your health, because we are FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't think that you're ever going to order again, I can cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, if you do wish to place a future refill, I do recommend putting it on a hold, and you can extend that hold at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you still have a prescription with refills available when you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, ma'am. I'd rather just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Not a problem. I've gone ahead and canceled you. You're all set, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Is there anything else I need to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope. You're canceled. You won't receive any future orders from us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hon. I sure appreciate it. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Thanks for calling in. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
