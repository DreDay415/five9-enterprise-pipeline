    "text": "Speaker 1: All right, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hey, you know one of the things I like about you guys is you have a telephone. I don't have to do things on my computer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I appreciate that. Thanks for taking my call. I am, my name is Bobby Moore.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have an order that it says it's ready to be picked up, but I thought it was shipped directly to my address.\n\nSpeaker 1: It should be typically shipped to your address, and I can check on the status for you, Bobby.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 10-5-56.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Bobby, I'm looking here. So, you know, typically we deliver it to your address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in this case, it would be delivered to 8937 Hoptown Road, Rudy, Arkansas.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you, by chance, when you received the tracking, opt in for the pharmacy, or excuse me, for the post office to hold it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Interesting. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says what I'm seeing here, and this is very strange.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I see the delivery went through, and then it's currently sitting at the post office in Rudy, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so they have it there. I don't know why it got opted in for this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe perhaps because it was the post office in Rudy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe they weren't necessarily comfortable dropping off the prescription without someone present,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then they could be holding it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I see it here as it's at the post office right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's waiting for pickup at customer request.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure why it was set up this way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe they did something in particular with why it should be set up or picked up this way.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's worth asking them.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they have it there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I have another quick question.\n\nSpeaker 1: I read some of the medical stuff, and this might not be for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm on two milligrams of a prescription called P-R-A-Z-O-Z-I-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the doctor I talked to said, yeah, I'm a good candidate for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then I read in the information that, I don't know,\n\nSpeaker 1: maybe it could cause my blood pressure to drop low.\n\nSpeaker 2: But no big deal, I'm assuming, because I told him about it too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, P-R-A-Z-O-Z-I-N specifically for hypertension,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're fine to take the Viagra with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm assuming this is why they started you at the 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: rather than jumping you up to 100 milligrams, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that purpose is to, you know, when you start with one pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: say you don't really feel like your blood pressure is dropping too much\n\nSpeaker 2: and you think it's safe to do 100 milligrams, you are welcome to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I assume that is why you're on the 50s rather than 100s right off the bat.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll get by the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And for any future orders, when you give us a call, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: like I said, this is the first time I've ever seen that without a patient\n\nSpeaker 1: requesting it specifically on the website.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So maybe they flagged it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's how that post office wants to handle medications.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, and we're in the middle of this winter storm here,\n\nSpeaker 2: and our roads are not very passable.\n\nSpeaker 1: So maybe, I don't know, maybe that's got something to do with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I know the folks, it's a very small town post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll run by there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want me to resend that to you so you can use it when you pop in there?\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be great if you could do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send it to me in a text?\n\nSpeaker 2: I sure can.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'm going to do is send you a notification\n\nSpeaker 2: via the United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be able to follow that link,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'll be able to see the tracking number and the current status\n\nSpeaker 1: in which I was referring to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me know when you receive that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll be able to see all that information there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy to help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: See you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
