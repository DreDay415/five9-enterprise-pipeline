    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jonathan Paul.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Jonathan. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Jonathan?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my orders. I have so many of these pills that I'll never use them all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay, Jonathan, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-1-71.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 64 Rocking Horse Drive, Palm Coast, Florida, 32164?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah, so you just have too many pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I have bottles and bottles. I went to the least amount that I can get, and I'm still not going through them enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I have like two years worth, three years worth.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Well, it is my job to let you know that if you did want to keep overall access to the script,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you just didn't want to receive those regular monthly refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order again, if it was before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, I mean, I got three unopened bottles sitting in my room.\n\nSpeaker 1: That doesn't include the four or five that I got before that were larger orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I don't think six months is I can go through those. No. I don't think I can go through a bottle in six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah. I mean, I enjoyed it. I don't know if they gave me the advanced one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I thought I was getting, but I mean, they look and react just like regular Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they weren't like the advanced formula that was supposedly the one I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if it was, then they definitely don't work within the 15 or 17 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Well, I am glad you're bringing that up because, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: your prescription is actually for a regular American Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if you did want to try a free sample of our newest, highest quality stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would be happy to send that out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the free sample would be 10 pills of our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my favorite thing about them is that we've specifically formulated them\n\nSpeaker 2: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the 10 free pills, basically the way it would work is you're in Palm Coast, Florida,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'd send them out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd probably get them by Saturday or Monday or Tuesday at the latest,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you would have until July to try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure you love them. Make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, and we believe in the next two to five months,\n\nSpeaker 1: you'd give us a call to order some, and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you did like them, we could price match your old price.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if they didn't work for you for any reason, you just have 10 free pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you'd have until July to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we could help you with whatever you need to do with the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we believe that you would love them based off of the very good reviews\n\nSpeaker 2: and the data with the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, it's up to you, but I'd be happy to send you some.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try it. I guess I should have called a lot earlier\n\nSpeaker 1: and not paid for all the generic ones, which that's not what I was signing up for.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I understand. Yeah, I am sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can I ship these to 64 Rocking Horse Drive, Palm Coast, Florida, 32164?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. And let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so these are going to be for 100 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they should be out to you, like I just mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 1: probably by maybe even Saturday, but Monday or Tuesday at the very latest.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need anything before July, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always at the phone number Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I hope you love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as long as you take them on an empty stomach and you avoid alcohol,\n\nSpeaker 2: when you take them, you will definitely notice a significant improvement.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will definitely give them a try.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, Jonathan. Well, thank you so much, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
