    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, this is Charles Charles, this is Ray Helman, Harrisburg, North\n\nSpeaker 2: Carolina.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you're doing well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you're doing well as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 28075.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: 8-26-50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would a lady happen to be there by the name of Christy?\n\nSpeaker 1: Christy, negative, not in the office.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: She said she was going to give me a number.\n\nSpeaker 2: My request, 422-771, when I talked to her.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to return it because it's false advertising.\n\nSpeaker 2: What they sent me was just regular generic pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: It worked in 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's got the same side effects as what my daughter, doctor, recommended from regular\n\nSpeaker 2: doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you're just trying to return everything?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and I want to make sure they don't send no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: I sent the other one back.\n\nSpeaker 1: She said they were sending me one.\n\nSpeaker 2: They did.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't open it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I marked return to sender, so it went back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now she sent me this other thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: She said it's supposed to be the score blue or whatever, where it works in 15 minutes\n\nSpeaker 1: with less side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same thing they sent before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Negative.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it might not look like much, Ray, but if it has the number 100 on it, I promise you\n\nSpeaker 1: that is the better pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I do see everything that you just said is 100% true.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, try that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's number 100 on what?\n\nSpeaker 1: On the pill bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me, on the pill itself, the actual pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you take one out, it should have the number 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the pill that's made in our France factory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so from across the pond.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it does have 100 marked on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so that is the better pill, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: I promise you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So try that out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it says the same thing on the front, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says take one tablet by mouth an hour before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so reason behind that, that we get this question a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why does it say up to an hour?\n\nSpeaker 2: Pharmacies need to put that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because not everybody's body is built the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so not everybody's body reacts to the Viagra within the 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So pharmacies have to put up to an hour.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill should activate.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I just said, not everybody's built the same, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So be patient with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: This pill is one hell of a pill, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got my uncles on it, Ray, and they absolutely like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let me ask you this.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much are they billing me for this?\n\nSpeaker 1: That one was free.\n\nSpeaker 2: That one was a complete replacement for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so how much is my regular bill, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So as soon as this is done, you said you refused everything,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm just going to go ahead and issue the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you do that, I'm going to make sure they don't send no more orders, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried telling that lady that, you know, but she just said I'm going to send this out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah, so I believe the deal was try it out,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we're going to hold everything for the next six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: that way you have time to try this pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you like it, call us and let us know what the future holds for the refills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's all I need to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: So my credit card's not going to be billed, nothing else shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, that's what I was worried.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, a lot of these companies put it on automatic renewal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: From what we're told, it's a standard practice for the industry,\n\nSpeaker 2: especially given that it's a prescription that's written up by an actual physician, licensed physician.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And believe it or not, some people actually do need these things every single month.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be actually very surprised how many people do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people do, some people don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you aren't one of those people.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I need it or I wouldn't be calling, you know, and I'm sure your uncle needs it.\n\nSpeaker 1: He wouldn't be knocking you on the door, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I'm 76.\n\nSpeaker 2: It don't work like it used to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, try them out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then everything is on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, try them out, call us back, and let us know what's the deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it best for me to keep a log on this, the date I take it, the time I take it, response, side effects?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or do y'all need any of that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, if you want to, like, do it for your own notes and whatnot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, like I just said, it's supposed to be working within about 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: But given everybody's medical history and whatnot, it might take a little bit longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, just be patient with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's supposed to give you a really, really great erection.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I thank you for your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you have a good one.",
