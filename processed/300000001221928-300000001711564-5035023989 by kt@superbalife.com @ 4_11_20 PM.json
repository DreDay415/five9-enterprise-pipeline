I don't see who's calling in but I can use this\n\nSpeaker 2: Number to pull up your account and then read off your chart.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hi, something so I can help you put a stop to this bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, I just got billed or like, and I called and they said oh—\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not gonna ship out till the 8th of February that we can refund you because I got—\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, that I think is the 8th of February because I got billed on the 8th of January.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm like, why would I?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so let me just look at what I see in this correct based on what you're saying, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You were working with Dr. Thomas Bolton II. He set you up with a—\n\nSpeaker 1: VIP session and this prescription he wrote was for a hundred mil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold up. Hold on. Hold on. Just a second. Yeah, hold on. Just a second, please. What?\n\nSpeaker 1: What are we asking for? I don't know the stuff. I just did—\n\nSpeaker 2: Everyone's all right here.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine, I just—\n\nSpeaker 2: Look around. I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that. No, no, but I'm in—no, no, I love you guys in Portland.\n\nSpeaker 2: I go down there all the time. I'm a Husky.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2005, but I was in Seattle many years and I—yeah, I used to drive down in high school because I was—\n\nSpeaker 2: Growing on Guam enough, but also in Napa Vine. Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, buddy of mine played for the Huskies back in the 90s when I was playing for the Ducks. So, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So like—\n\nSpeaker 2: What am I a—\n\nSpeaker 1: Wrestling friend that you did to a Sherman Brooks. It was a part of that the Golden Key. Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Tied in but a broad. Let me put you on before because I only have a certain amount of time to put a stop to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, no, I just want to know what's going on because they told me they're gonna refund me the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it was going to be like, you know, two more weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: I called like a week ago or earlier this week and they said they would just take it off and then you can—\n\nSpeaker 1: Do it when it becomes available again, and I'm like, well it says it's once a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the guy's like no, the farmers to get all. I'll handle, so I just didn't know what to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I'll handle this because I'm very good at this stuff and as a veteran, but I do see—\n\nSpeaker 2: Very meticulous and a lot of honor and pride. So give me about one minute and I'll make this. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. Thanks, boss.",
