    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Randall Schaefer. I had placed an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. You probably need an order number. I received my package today, my order today,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's not what I thought I was getting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can definitely help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is your date of birth, Randall?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-8-54.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And you're located at 601 Village Court, Travis City, Michigan?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Yeah, so I do see your order here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, you said the order wasn't what you were anticipating.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it says it's the generic Viagra. I thought I was getting the AVG.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this the AVG? This is just regular Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is – so you should have received the AGV, and you're saying you didn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think I did. I mean, on the bottle, it says generic or Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Psyllidine fill, 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't say anywhere on there that it's AVG.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so do you have the pills with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, can you take them out and tell me what the pills say on them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. I didn't do that yet. I could do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, maybe they are. I just – it doesn't say anywhere on the bottle or anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm a little bit confused, and so I thought I'd better call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see. I've got to get my glasses, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just want to know what letters are on there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It's got AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so – okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, you did receive the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will send you out as a replacement, obviously, on us, because you already paid for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it happens. I understand. I thought maybe I screwed up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. No, you're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No, you're fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll do 50 milligrams. We'll do 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship this to 601 Village Court, Traverse City, Michigan?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can't take these back, can you? I mean, because I've touched them now, so you can't –\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so you can just throw them away, keep them, whatever you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and if you need anything in the future, we're always here at this phone number,\n\nSpeaker 2: Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way you will know that these are the AGV is on them, the pills will say 5-0 for 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then – so the pills will say 5-0, and then the side of the bottle will say Greenstone,\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's the manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as long as you take them on an empty stomach and you avoid alcohol the day you take them,\n\nSpeaker 2: you will definitely notice a significant improvement compared to regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I appreciate your help. Your name was what, Olivia, you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your help very much. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Thank you so much, Randall. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
