Let me pull up your account. We can get this adjusted.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Brian Battle. My date of birth is 9-15-81.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Brian. So your prescription here was for the 100 milligram Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, quantity 25. Looks like the doctor wrote it on monthly, bi-monthly refills. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, Brian, I'm not sure if you saw in the notes from the doctor's initial prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: back in November, but you're not required to get this monthly or bi-monthly. This is\n\nSpeaker 2: by no means a subscription. If you wanted to adjust it, you could simply pause it and that\n\nSpeaker 1: would allow you to call in and place orders as needed. It does appear you have about 10\n\nSpeaker 2: refills accessible to you on the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that'd be better. That'd be better because I don't...\n\nSpeaker 2: The frequency is probably just a little bit too much, yeah?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, it doesn't really work for me. It hasn't really worked for me even.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, make sure you just take it as recommended on an empty stomach without alcohol,\n\nSpeaker 1: things like that. Try to avoid fatty foods. You might see a difference there. But I did\n\nSpeaker 2: go ahead and just put this on a pause for you. So if you want to place an order,\n\nSpeaker 1: just be sure to give us a call, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was going to put these to a pause and then I'm going to call it a day.",
