    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I talked to a guy by the name of Nick yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: He tried to give me his number, but I was driving, so I couldn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: His name was Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that who you are?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Nick is here.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's not here for the day.\n\nSpeaker 1: He left already.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Nick, that's the person you spoke to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I have this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And apparently, I ordered the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And apparently, my prescription, that's not what it even is, which is a big problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have the pill in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 1: You have the pill in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm working out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you need from me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at the pill bottle, and he told me that he needed to have it when I called back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you have the pills with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I was asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Viagra, the Viagra, the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the medicine in front of you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have the last prescription that I got.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me what is engraved on the actual pill, the diamond white shaped pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you tell me what is engraved, the medical code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't say anything about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: These numbers are small.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you say you wanted to order AGV, but you feel like you didn't get the right stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: When I ordered them, that's what I told them I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got this stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't work for me any better than the normal Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I wanted to try the other stuff, and here I've been getting it for four months,\n\nSpeaker 1: second time getting AGV, and they're charging me every month,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't even get what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so what happened was, well, I heard your concern.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to fix that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What happened was, for some reason, your order came in a system at the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: not with the full spec, because I see that here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if it was a connectivity issue when you placed the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why they fulfilled what they had.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wish you would have called us right away when that happened so we could have replaced it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I had no idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought I was getting the good stuff, and it's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you a replacement, okay, a bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a bottle with 25 pills of Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill is going to say 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you have is regular, generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to send is the improved formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what about the four prescriptions I've already got that are not good?\n\nSpeaker 2: What do I do with them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get a refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if I send you a replacement, I cannot send you, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: if I refund you, I cannot send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, send me a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't charge me anymore until I find out if it's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, this is bull.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, this is bull.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm out, like, $160.\n\nSpeaker 2: $160 because I was supposed to be getting something I'm not getting,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm not happy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, the order came the way it was placed.\n\nSpeaker 1: I heard that, but it still doesn't make it right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now, if it comes wrong, the pharmacy is going to fulfill what is wrong\n\nSpeaker 2: because they received it wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, when you let us know, now we fix it.\n\nSpeaker 2: We send you the replacement with what you need, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what we're doing right now, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: We send you some pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how we receive the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those pills are going to be a waste, right, for the company anyway\n\nSpeaker 1: because we're not charging you any more money.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're just sending you a replacement, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's just I had no way of knowing that I wasn't getting the good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I didn't know the words.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's move forward so we can send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what you want, and we have no issue with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: We understand your concern.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's move forward, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a replacement of the Avagra AGV so you can try the right stuff, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: How soon will that be?\n\nSpeaker 2: Two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill is going to say 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a different formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the improved formula of this paragraph.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm sending you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Seven.\n\nSpeaker 2: Eight.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ten.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why he did about the August.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's your moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your last gift.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure you can do it with the property.\n\nSpeaker 2: Look out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is just a small area.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's really good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Stanton.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send you the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send you the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Stanley.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just sent you the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, two to five business day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't get a refund for the mistake that you guys made or the pharmacy or whoever made\n\nSpeaker 2: it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you're saying, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't get a refund for the mistake that you guys made or the pharmacy or whoever made\n\nSpeaker 2: it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, what would you like to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: You would like to receive the correct pill or you would like a refund?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'd like to do both.\n\nSpeaker 2: I cannot refund you and send you a free pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't refund you money and send you a free pill, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't make money.\n\nSpeaker 2: I must have already paid $160 for prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's what we're replacing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what we're replacing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're sending me $160 worth of pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: One thing at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: The order came the way it came from the way you placed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We didn't place it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It came the way it came.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what the pharmacy fulfilled.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
