    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi. How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Steve.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just calling just to find out if these type of pills, if you have sense,\n\nSpeaker 2: but does that affect anything,\n\nSpeaker 1: or can you still get the same effect on just a regular Viagra versus this one,\n\nSpeaker 2: or can it still, what do you call it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you get lightheaded when you take these?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's a great question.\n\nSpeaker 1: These pills, the Viagra AGV, they have been specifically.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the difference?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: They have specifically been formulated to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're the newest pill that comes directly from the Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: They do act within 11 to 30 minutes, and they act for hours longer than regular.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, do you think they really work, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I never tried it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't really need them, but I guess it can only help last longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a better way of putting it, if you know what I mean, like, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: like making it last, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're a lady, so I just want to be careful, you know, with respect.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it would last longer than the regular Viagra, is that true?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reviews are much higher, and it does work for the overwhelming majority of people, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it's the best Viagra in the U.S.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So is it an FDA, they approved it, FDA, or is it something that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if it comes from Pfizer, the creator of Viagra, then yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's third-party tested.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ask you something?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know when you see all the Facebook ads and you see, oh, you put this oil on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just have to be honest.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if you see all that, do you think any of those work, or is that the money thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, like there's oil under your tongue, or, you know, they talk about all these things,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then they promote all this, like Dr. Oz, and do you think that's a scam?\n\nSpeaker 2: Probably.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the thing is, unless they are natural products with very minor improvements, which is possible,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would say, you know, you need testing to find out how well a product works\n\nSpeaker 2: and to look at the success and the efficacy, which, you know, is what you're going to get with third-party testing,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I don't know that enough testing has been done on those other products,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm also not extensively versed on them, so I really can't comfortably speak to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, can I ask you, can these pills actually hurt you in any way?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, you have 50s, 100s, how do you know which one to take?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, how do you know which one to take?\n\nSpeaker 2: Milligrams, like, I guess there's three different, 25, 50, and 100, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's up to your preference.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, if you want to order 25 milligrams, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to order 100, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then as long as it's safe for you to take, which the doctor determines\n\nSpeaker 1: based off of the medical information in the medical survey that you fill out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but does all the blood work the same way as a regular Viagra, or differently?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, the active ingredient, sildenafil, is the same active ingredient as in every Viagra product ever made\n\nSpeaker 2: and that, you know, probably will ever be made until the end of time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, kind of, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But have you heard, like, good, like, how do I say this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, let's just say you take it, right, and it lasts 14 hours,\n\nSpeaker 2: does that mean that the person could actually, do I say, walk around with a problem?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you have to get aroused yourself to get that to work, still?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or like in 11 minutes, is this going to go, happen by itself?\n\nSpeaker 1: You follow me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, usually the person has to feel, let's just say, with your partner or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: or get aroused, that's how it works?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or is it just going to work on its own without even getting aroused?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would say, I mean, you probably still need to be aroused.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know that the pill\n\nSpeaker 1: You follow me though, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it does significantly increase blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it does?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, it's, I mean, it sounds like you need some time to think about it, which is totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, whenever you are ready to order, we are always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, let me ask you, can a doctor actually get a prescription for this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you can't get it that way?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because we exclusively, we bought the exclusive rights through Pfizer to sell it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, and not like the drug stores?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how much, so you can't go through you through a prescription, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you have to have a prescription to receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, one of our doctors does have to approve it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they do that based off of the medical information in the survey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me ask you, I'm not, I mean, I have coverage, I have like a little copay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we don't take insurance.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so like how much, how many pills do you get in a bottle?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if you wanted to do 10 pills, which is the smallest size that we order, those are $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted to do 25 pills, it's $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you want to do 40, it's $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the price of the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, does it matter which ones?\n\nSpeaker 2: You get the hundreds, the fifties, or how does that work?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It don't matter?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're all the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, correct, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what happens if you want to try to make sure it's good, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: What happens?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nope.\n\nSpeaker 2: We would never give free prescription medication to somebody who hasn't been approved by a doctor who doesn't, that would be illegal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very unsafe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so yeah, we're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Keep us in mind whenever you're ready to order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, that's all the info.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can look up some of the reviews.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we have great reviews because the product is great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
