Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Peter Coughlin, C-O-U-G-H-L-I-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Peter. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm glad to hear it. How can I help you today, Peter?\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to cancel my subscription with you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this. Okay, Peter, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 7-5-68.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 2925 Snowden Hill Road, Sequoia, New York?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so I see your prescription here. All right, Peter, well just so you know, you do not have to receive regular monthly refills with your prescription if you don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option with this prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you did want to order before then, so at this point that would be late July, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, go ahead and do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, if you need anything before July 27th, just give us a call this number Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific. We're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and your prescription is on hold otherwise, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, bye.",
