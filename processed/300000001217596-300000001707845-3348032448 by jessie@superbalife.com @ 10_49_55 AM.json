    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm already a customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Johnny Lang, L-A-N-G.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you need my email address?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can take your zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: 36375.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull this up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're at 535 Hardin Road, L.A.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that sound right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's me, baby.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where are you from?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're here in California.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's warm.\n\nSpeaker 1: What part of California?\n\nSpeaker 2: Southern California.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, that's L.A. or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you down in the L.A. area?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, we're in the L.A. area.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're in L.A.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not in L.A.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then how long did you live in this area for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's colder up there but it's not like.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the weather in Alabama?\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you guys been blanketed in snow yet?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we're not blanketed in snow but it's cold as heck.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like 25 degrees today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where I know was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh no.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I left this morning like 19, so it's up to about 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you looking to get a refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to refill what I already got because I got some of them already.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a whole bunch of them already.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want some of that new stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: You wanted to get the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the one where you start.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one where you start in 11 minutes or whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one I want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: The same 10 pills for the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can match that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to do that or do you want to do more?\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, how much was the 10 I was getting?\n\nSpeaker 2: The 10 is you've been paying $63.95 and I can match that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I get 20 for the same price?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have 25 for $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if I do the 25, how many can I get?\n\nSpeaker 2: How many more can I get?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, can I get some extra for the 99?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get some?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're getting a total of 25 pills for 99.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a better deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a better deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a better deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Come on now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would like to.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is just a drop-down menu.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: See if we can do something for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I can ask them to throw in some additional pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't make any promises, okay, but I'll try to do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, those are 100 milligrams, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligram AGVs.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want that new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want that new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I saw that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, just bear in mind, though, they might look – they look very similar to the old\n\nSpeaker 2: pills that you were getting.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not the same, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, just so you know, the stamp on those old pills are different from the new ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, the new –\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get an old one, not an old one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not an old one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get a white one, not a blue, because I'll get the white one.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they're always white.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Pfizer makes –\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, they're always white.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're always white.\n\nSpeaker 1: They don't copy the color of the blue one because they don't want to cannibalize that\n\nSpeaker 2: market.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, they're not trying to confuse people.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, they make the AGV white, and then they make the branded one blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: The difference is the stamp on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the AGV has a stamp of 100 on it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: The only other pill that has that stamp is the blue branded one.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you know it's from Pfizer, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm getting a new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm getting a new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're getting a new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's a good question.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have the list of ingredients, but it's basically an updated formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's much stronger, and it's just faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I've had, like, three other people literally call me today, like, to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's that good.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're just like, this stuff works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they had just ordered, like, a couple weeks ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, they're just like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, like, it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's really good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, let me get it back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you drink on them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you drink lightly on them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you have a beer or something before?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're really not supposed to take any medication with alcohol.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're just going to end up wasting your pills doing that, because then it might affect\n\nSpeaker 1: them, you know, whether it works or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, always take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take it on an empty stomach, or if you need to eat, keep it a light meal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do not eat greasy food.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, if you have a T-bone steak or a, you know, nice greasy Philly cheesesteak\n\nSpeaker 2: sandwich, that's not going to help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's going to…\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because grease constricts your capillaries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Another thing is coffee.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, avoid coffee, because caffeine…\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't drink coffee, no way.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm not riding a taxi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That makes that easy.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, stay away from the T-bone steak.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, that's basically it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, are you going to try to give me something extra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, like, I'll let them know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, is there a…\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a visa on file that ends in 4716.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should we use that card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think…\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: The one I have…\n\nSpeaker 2: The one I'm going to use is going to be a visa, but it's going to…\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you ready for the number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4852…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …6000…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …00…\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did I…\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's start over again, because I've got to be…\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4852…\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: …6000…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …0007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …60007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …60007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …60007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …60007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …60007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …60007…\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: …8079.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration is 0128.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 063.\n\nSpeaker 1: 063.\n\nSpeaker 2: And is this a debit or credit card?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a bank debit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and process this for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now, you're going to put me to make sure in there, they got…how you going to do that\n\nSpeaker 1: one now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I just notify the pharmacy and ask them if they can add them.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they can, they will.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they can't, then they can't, because these are in high demand, so it really depends\n\nSpeaker 1: on what their supply is, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: How soon before I get…how soon before they get out to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, 2016.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription is still active, so…\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, expect it in less than a week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I don't want them old ones now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want the old ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want the new ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not the old ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not the old ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the new ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you said I should get them out pretty soon?\n\nSpeaker 2: I should get them…\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Roughly under a week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If not less, because you're already in the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Super.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, enjoy the California weather.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're in California, but the pharmacy is in Kentucky, so it's quite close to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
