    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, this is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, this is Tyrone White.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a prescription with you. Is the score blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is the score blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm looking for a Viagra, A, B, D.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we can place an order for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking for a Viagra, a regular Viagra, A, B, D.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm pulling up your account too here. Okay, you're in Gary, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so yeah, I see you got 10 pills last time. If you got 10, it's $63.95. If you want more than 10, we do have more than 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the A, G, V, A, the Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. That would be the A, G, V pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not the generic?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, A, G, V is a generic, but it's the A, G, V version. It means that Pfizer's making it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Typically, a generic's made by a third party, but the original company is making this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: The generic?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but that's what the G in A, G, V stands for, Authorized Generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I was saying, it's basically like, if you think of it like store brand sodas.\n\nSpeaker 2: If Coke made their own store brand version of Coke and called it Authorized Generic Coke, but it was in a yellow can instead of red, but it was the same exact thing, that's kind of what this is like.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is just as good as the name brand pill, the blue one, if not even a little bit better, but it's just a white pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that is the pricing on it for the 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, we're talking about the same exact thing, sir. I'm just trying to help you better understand exactly what it is, but we're talking about the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra, A, G, V.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. It's the most effective one we have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have to change my card number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do you have the card now, though, like you're ready to do that, or do you need to call back?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the card now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not ready. One second, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now I'm ready. I'm ready for 5...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. The expiration, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then there's a 3...\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-26?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-48.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was up there? 9-40 what?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-48.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha, gotcha. It caught off at the 8 the first time. Okay, one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you wanted 10 to the 100 mg, right? Nothing's different on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Yeah, 100 mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And it's going to the same Mississippi Street apartment through 26?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you read me the card number one time? I think I made a mistake in the numbers somewhere, because it said invalid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 5-33-2-4805-1808-6048.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then 0-2-26. And what was the code one more time? 9-4-8?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 9-4-8.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Fix the mistake. We're all set. Your order went through. You're going to get 10 of the AGV pills sent out to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're getting the new one, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you're getting the new, improved, better one. That's what we got you set up with. Not the old one that you've had before, but the new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it can work that fast, exactly. And it's much more effective generally. So that's what we got you set up with, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Approximately a week. Our pharmacy is in Kentucky, and they're dealing with snow, like I'm sure you probably are in Indiana.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're having some issues with mail pickup right now, but they will get it shipped out this week, and then it should be to you within about a week or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I hope you have a good one, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
