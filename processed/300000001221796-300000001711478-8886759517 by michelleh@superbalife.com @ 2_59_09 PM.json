    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am, I'd like to cancel my order for next month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I have your phone number so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Area code 225-572-4441.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Curtis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 07-09-65.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see you're a VIP status member.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, and you just want to skip a month's refill?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not working for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the medication working?\n\nSpeaker 2: I know why it's not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have them on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: I know why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ma'am?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, say it again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the medication on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't have the bottle with me right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have it with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's totally fine, because I can confirm.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just received the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: They did not send you the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out of replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you\n\nSpeaker 1: received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes the pharmacy runs out of the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they don't tell us, and that creates a bunch of problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so that's what it is, generic?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's going to say APCO on your bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's going to say AC imprinted\n\nSpeaker 1: on your pills, followed by numbers like 390.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't accept the call, so I can't say anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought I had one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought I had a bottle with me, but I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have it with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know what that is.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was trying to see what it said on that pill, but AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: Throw those away.\n\nSpeaker 2: Throw those away?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, those are just generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so tomorrow, the pharmacy will be shipping out\n\nSpeaker 1: the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this new bottle, it's\n\nSpeaker 1: going to say AGB on the bottle, but it's also\n\nSpeaker 2: going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted\n\nSpeaker 1: is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received\n\nSpeaker 1: Pfizer-Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what I'm going to do, I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause it till July 31st of 2026,\n\nSpeaker 1: because if I cancel you out now, it will delete your profile,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pharmacy would not be able to send you out\n\nSpeaker 1: that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll give you my extension, so you can call me back\n\nSpeaker 1: and let me know how the AGB works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, hold on, just send me your number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I say, that's why I didn't know it was automatic refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know it was automatic refill, either.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it hasn't worked for me, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought, well, really, I thought, well,\n\nSpeaker 2: me, because every now and then, I drink a beer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like you say, I do it two hours ahead of time\n\nSpeaker 2: or an hour ahead of time, like, wait for it, wait for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait for it, it's not kicking in?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just, you know, excuse me, how do you say it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just take it till I make it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me for saying it like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I do the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, what's your number?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, it's my, OK, the phone number is 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 1: 07?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and my extension is 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020, OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, Michelle, OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's up, Michelle?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been with y'all, so I've been\n\nSpeaker 1: getting jacked for the last.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you have been, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my goodness, that's $65.\n\nSpeaker 2: I still got three bottles, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just, you know, every time I see\n\nSpeaker 2: I was going to stop taking it, but I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know it was automatic refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I think, I tried it a couple of times, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I just, man, I just, yeah, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm sending you an extra $10 for your troubles.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to get $40 total.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, yeah, so on the pill, it's\n\nSpeaker 2: only going to have the number 100 imprinted.\n\nSpeaker 1: And these are going to work way better.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you just want to make sure you don't,\n\nSpeaker 1: try to eat them, take it on an empty stomach,\n\nSpeaker 2: or just don't eat a fatty meal, like a burger or a steak,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that will affect the medication, break it down.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will make it take longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, what about alcohol?\n\nSpeaker 2: Drinking a beer, it's OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think a beer is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they say, you know, alcohol affects the medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I mean, we've got to live our lives, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, so the one coming in for February, that's the new one?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, they're going to ship it out to you tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's going to be the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're getting a quantity of 40, because you paid for,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, OK, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it don't work, I'm going to be saying your name,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to be on the screen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you give me a call, Curtis.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you for taking on your name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've got me a little confident, but not right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a call back and let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just had a guy call me back today.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's like, this worked out great.\n\nSpeaker 1: He disputed it with his credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he called me back to tell me he owes us\n\nSpeaker 1: money because it worked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now that's the 100 or the generic?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, generic, it didn't do nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what he said, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: The generic didn't do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he said the AGD is working for him.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, well, I hope I have a good call like that\n\nSpeaker 1: if I can call you, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to hear it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you very much, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great night.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
