    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, yes, I'd like to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, give me one moment. Putting your prescription in.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the phone number used for your prescription? That number don't give me no account.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 925-757-6429 doesn't do it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 925-207-5047.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Gary Willis?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, your prescription from Dr. Snyder for Viagra, 50 mg, 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need it as often? You want to pause and order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to cancel it. I don't want it recurring.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what I'm saying. You want to order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I tell the pharmacy to stop the original reading from the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I think he got you every 30 days because you ordered 10 and it was 30 days in a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can tell them to stop that.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's just going to order as needed if that's a better option.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I want to just simply cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, just be advised, if you try to reorder, two things are going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you see the order not going through because the company doesn't want to refinance the doctor's consultation,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if it does go through, you might have a different price.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because they're going to have to reinvest under your name.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why they offer you to pause for half a year, and you can get 10 pills once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: or more if you need more, but not every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was just original writing from the doctor, assuming that you're an active patient.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, understood.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I cancel the doctor consultation here, cancel the VIP account.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set, Mr. Willis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What email address do you have for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have Willis underscore Gary at oatmeal.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it was put in wrong somewhere, but that's all I need right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You're all set.",
