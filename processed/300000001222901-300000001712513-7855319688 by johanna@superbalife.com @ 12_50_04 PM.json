I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your most recent order that you received, that was the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you had an opportunity to try it out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and it doesn't do me any different than the regular Sildenafil that I've been taking prior to.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you are taking it on an empty stomach, right? Not on a full stomach?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because that will greatly impact how well it works also.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, so we're taking a 100 milligram of the AGB and it's still not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would suggest then the other thing that I could offer you is sending you the activator at no cost since you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: The activator is a natural herbal supplement.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you a month's supply if you'll take it for at least two to three weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that's going to do is it's going to reset your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you properly absorb the Viagra and it works as intended.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to increase blood circulation, which is what you want to increase the strength of erections,\n\nSpeaker 2: as well as increase oxygen transport to activate muscle tissue and increase endurance.\n\nSpeaker 1: So take it for two to three weeks and then go back to taking the Viagra and you should notice a huge difference in how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get that sent out to you today and then I can put your account on a hold until July.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll give you plenty of time to try it out and see how you like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you my extension number.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call me back and let me know how you want to set up your account going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's this going to cost along with the other?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send this to you as a courtesy at no cost since you're a VIP status customer at this time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I take that the same time I take a pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you're using the activator, we're going to reboot your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, again, it's a natural herbal supplement, but you do have to take it for at least two to three weeks\n\nSpeaker 1: and then pause on taking the Viagra and then go back to taking the Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: and you should notice an improvement in how it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just stop the Viagra and use this activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, for two to three weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll sign that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think you'll be happy with the results.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is 0024.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what's this?\n\nSpeaker 2: You hear everybody talking about Viagra, a heart on your heart, giving you all kinds of side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is this doing the same thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what's so great about the new AGV that you receive is that all of those common side effects,\n\nSpeaker 2: people used to experience.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pfizer, over time, obviously has made modifications and improvements to how they formulate the Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: and they have altered some of the inactive ingredients.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this one has no side effects compared to the previous version or FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the telehealth doctor who approved your prescription, if there was any risk to you at all,\n\nSpeaker 1: would have mentioned it and not written the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, the Viagra is safe to take or regulated, unlike a lot of the ED medications on the market\n\nSpeaker 1: who are not regulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll give that a try and see if that does any good then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds great, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll get that sent out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for calling in and letting me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a wonderful rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
