    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, yeah. Good afternoon. My name's Paul Niemann,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I currently get a prescription from, uh, Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I also, probably about six months ago,\n\nSpeaker 2: I got a plain... I got a prescription from my actual doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I see a difference in strength that I get from the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: than I get from Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a reason for that?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, and plus my one from Scor-Blue are twice as expensive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, basically, you get a 50 milligram from Scor-Blue,\n\nSpeaker 2: uh, and you're getting 100 milligram from your pharmacy?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, just 50. I'm only getting 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can take up to 100 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yeah, up to. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's the same thing here with Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, the only difference is here,\n\nSpeaker 2: uh, the pills that you're getting are made between the U.S. and France.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, the source are really, really good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, and what was your concern, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: My call was that my one that I get from my prescription from my doctor...\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: ...worked better. I have a better erection and more often.\n\nSpeaker 2: Really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Honest.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's why I said...\n\nSpeaker 1: And I pay, I pay...\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I get 20 or 30 for $13.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm.\n\nSpeaker 2: $150 from, for 40 from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just, I don't think it's, it's not even a fair trade-off,\n\nSpeaker 2: especially when they're working...\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm. ...better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I have better reaction.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I see what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, uh...\n\nSpeaker 1: ...six or eight out of that bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: out of the bottles I've just gotten,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I, I mean, I'm paying for something that really can't...\n\nSpeaker 1: that's not doing as good as I can from my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was wondering what I could do or...\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, I mean, um...\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that's strange that it don't work for you as, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I know different lab, different reaction, but, you know, um...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, we can pause the prescription if you like,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can order one in a while, just 10 pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: no more 25, no more 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, you can get 10 pill for 49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's...\n\nSpeaker 1: Once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: I paid $149 for the last batch, I thought.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that was a bigger quantity, but what I can do,\n\nSpeaker 2: uh, you can just stay with 10 pills once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you, if you're more active with what the pharmacy gets you\n\nSpeaker 2: and to avoid you to pay, like, a higher price,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can just lower the quantity as much as possible.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you just have that in the back end as a backup once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: but not every month and no 40, no 25 pill if it's too heavy\n\nSpeaker 2: and you have another prescription for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way you keep your prescription in case there is a new Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: at the, at the current price level.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're just going to save, uh, like,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're just going to save every time you get instead of the 163,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to pay, uh, probably $60.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, well, I, I want to put it on pause right now cause I'm not,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm not,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just not going to get them as long as I can get them from my own pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: at a cheaper rate.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd be forward to not to continue that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you want to pause and maybe get 10 once or twice a year\n\nSpeaker 1: instead of the 40 every other month?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, how, but how much is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: How much is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to cost more money.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, so, so it's $49 for 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm paying $13 for 20 from my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't know where they get that from though.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's, that's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's from my pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not, I mean, pharmacy by anywhere, you know, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: They get supply, whatever, because people need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, that's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why it's so cheap sometime, you know, and some pharmacy, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: they, some, it's not the pharmacy fault, but it's a source.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes they put all this stuff to make sure things work,\n\nSpeaker 1: but sometimes it's, you know, it's, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: pharmacy, I have a shortage of, you know, supply.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I scored blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: They make sure it's France or U.S.\n\nSpeaker 1: and also they don't have a bunch of different meds.\n\nSpeaker 2: They just work with different type of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: different type of Cialis and that's it, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, if there's a difference, why is the one pharmacy stronger\n\nSpeaker 1: than the ones I get from, uh, from other meds?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I can get you, um, I can get you, uh,\n\nSpeaker 1: maybe a hundred milligrams moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm getting 50, I'm getting a 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I just take two, I just take two 50s.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: From both, scored blue and from, from my pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause you and get you maybe on 10 pills only once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: but not every month, 40 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll let you know if I need some of the five, if I issue you some of the five.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll let you know if I need some of the five.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll let you know if I need some of the five,\n\nSpeaker 1: if I issue you with my prescription from my pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: but right now I don't want anything from go, from scored blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm just going to pause it so you don't lose the price,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that way you're not going to receive anything for now\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you can kind of make your mind and see what's going on and reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'm just going to pause it for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
