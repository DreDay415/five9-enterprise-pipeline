How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Nicholas Mendoza and I just wanted to change the...\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to see, first of all, if it's like a recurring thing,\n\nSpeaker 2: you guys like send the same thing over and over each month or do I have to do that manually?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your profile. Nicholas, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 7-28-1981.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer\n\nSpeaker 2: and it looks like the doctor put you on automatic refills every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's fine. Yeah, it's fine. It works just fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was using that Bluetooth stuff and it was giving me like a really bad headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: This one doesn't give me a headache, so I'm cool with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good. Yeah, and with your VIP status, you don't have to have your refills every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you can change that to your liking in monthly increments every three months, every four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some people just like to go ahead and put a six-month hold on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, can you help me out with that because I tried to do that on you guys' web page.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you got to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you got to get a call. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to pause you until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And also just a reminder, whenever you call in and if you do a refill on your computer like online,\n\nSpeaker 1: it will automatically put you back to every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when you call in or if you call in to get a refill, sometimes people don't look that you're on a six-month hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just remind them, hey, I want a refill, but pause it again for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, got it, got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so just call back if like if I want another refill more soon, then I just call you guys back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool, cool. I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're going to go ahead and set that six-month thing up for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you're paused until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thanks a lot for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
