    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia, this is Gary Peters.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Gary.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, not Gary.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gary, G-A-R-Y.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Gary.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So glad to hear it.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today, Gary?\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish to cancel my prescription program with Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1-25-50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're located at 105 Longview Avenue, Jamestown, New York?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I do see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it does look like you have a lot of pills, so that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, just so you know, Gary,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you don't want to receive those regular refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six\n\nSpeaker 1: months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order,\n\nSpeaker 1: if it is before then, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there won't be an automatic prescription refill then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the way it would work is the prescription would be placed on hold\n\nSpeaker 2: until August 12th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then August 12th, so that the prescription didn't expire,\n\nSpeaker 1: it would be refilled unless you called us to let us know you still had pills\n\nSpeaker 2: and didn't need any, and then we could leave you on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you called earlier to place an order,\n\nSpeaker 2: that would reset everything as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, you would just need to let us know by August 12th if you wanted to\n\nSpeaker 2: make any changes.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that would just give you the opportunity to keep access to the\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription, the doctor's approval, and the price point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so if I don't call by August 12th, then you'll end the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, so August 12th would be your one refill date every six months in order\n\nSpeaker 1: to keep the prescription active unless you let us know that you didn't need\n\nSpeaker 2: it or you needed it earlier, and then that would reset everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I don't need it any longer, so I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it just seemed like if you're asking me about that,\n\nSpeaker 1: you will use it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you do, in fact, need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm just saying I need to cancel the prescription, period.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last part of my job is to let you know, and if you're into it, great,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if not, no worries, that you do qualify if you were interested\n\nSpeaker 1: and the pills weren't working for you, which now you have communicated.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do qualify for a free sample of our newest, highest-quality products,\n\nSpeaker 1: which it looks like you haven't tried.\n\nSpeaker 2: The free sample would be 10 pills of our fastest-acting,\n\nSpeaker 1: longest-lasting stuff we've ever made from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about the product is that we specifically formulated it\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache\n\nSpeaker 2: because I know those do affect some people.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the way it would work is the free sample is 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'd send those out to you, and you're in New York,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you'd probably get them by, like, next Monday or Tuesday,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you would have until July to try them out, make sure you love them,\n\nSpeaker 1: make sure you've performed your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, and we believe that you'd use them by then,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you'd give us a call in the next two to five months to order some,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we would be willing to price-match your old price if you did end up loving them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you know pretty quick if they didn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you just have to let us know by July\n\nSpeaker 1: because the prescription that would be started at $0\n\nSpeaker 2: that I would send you the 10 free pills for would be placed on hold for you until then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, we'll try that, but I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll give it a try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it's a great product,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it is a superior product to your current script, that's for sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they're FDA approved and third-party tested, of course,\n\nSpeaker 1: because, you know, they come from Pfizer Direct, so that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can I send these 10 pills to 105 Longview Avenue,\n\nSpeaker 2: Jamestown, New York, 14701?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so, yeah, you'll probably receive these, like I mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 2: maybe even as soon as Saturday, but probably Monday or Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you need anything, we're always here at this number,\n\nSpeaker 2: Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we don't open until 11 your time, but you can call us as late as 7:30.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, if you need anything before July, just give us a shout.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Gary.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.",
