One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Dale Anderson?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Atlantic City, Wyoming? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Overstock right now, Dale? Need to pump the brakes for a while?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm overstocked. Overstocked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can pause everything from now until June. Does that sound good?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, just pause until we're good, and then I'll call you when I want to restart it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. The waiting list is pretty long.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you sure you don't want to just pause for the time being and work with us on when you need it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'll just give you a call when I need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Good luck.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Our waiting list is very, very long to get back a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Pause until June then. I don't know if all this stuff I got now will fit then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, just let us know. Let us know. We're very customer-friendly here, Dale.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0040 if you ever want to pause it further or order earlier, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought this stuff was supposed to be the AGV stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is. Does it have the number 50 pressed onto it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it have the number 50 pressed onto it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it does, that is the true AGV bill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's 50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that is the true AGV bill, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. So go ahead and pause until June then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good. Okay. Keep me in the loop on when it's needed and not needed, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your extension, did you say?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0040.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0040. Okay. I'll write that down.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles. Okay, Charles. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Take care.",
