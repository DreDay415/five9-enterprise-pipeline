I went ahead and paused your account out so you won't get any monthly prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you decide to get this medication or any of the other medications, you can do so by calling in or placing an order online with the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you have effectively canceled my subscription more or less is what I want?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you won't get any subscription monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything else I can assist you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty.
