    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Will, this is KT again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey bud, thanks for holding. I did exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just, I got my fingerprints on this and as a veteran,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm always willing to do what's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you know, I bleed red, white, and blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: But so, I see you're in Tennessee.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's where my grandmother's from.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, Nashville.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, man, I miss you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was down there in Alabama two months ago, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you know, they're trying to change the landscape there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've got all these damn franchises going down there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can't even get chicken and dumplings just from a regular mom-and-pop restaurant.\n\nSpeaker 1: There are all these franchises.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that really changes the home-style cook and the culture there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But nevertheless, Mr. Hispher, I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I definitely put a stop to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: I pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I set it up where you can click a button to get refills on your own.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you know what I noticed on your chart?\n\nSpeaker 1: And just correct me if I'm wrong because I want to get rid of this Dr. Botini.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I don't know if he's doing it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But here's the thing is it says something like has patient.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he didn't write this, but this is what I'm seeing on the notes that he didn't reply to.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says has patient Hispher experienced any hardness or erection within a 30 to 60-minute period taking the 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes or no?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is good to know, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because has patient Hispher experienced any erection and or hardness longer than four to six hours?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so and then has patient Hispher experienced any erection or any adverse side effects other than erection or hardness within a 24-hour period?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what this means is the doctor wrote your prescription and it's not working for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on to what you got.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to change that guy and I'm going to bill him for replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to give you something that's better.\n\nSpeaker 1: He should have given you our new and improved AGV instead of the regular AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just hold those and I'm going to send you at no cost to you and no commitment, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get these by next week because the weather is pretty tough right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just hold tight and I'll send you 20 pills to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then call me at 0037-0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name is Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then give me the thumbs up or green light and then let me know how these go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then we can go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we'll take it one step at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to send it to the 129 Swiney Lane, is that Tennessee?\n\nSpeaker 1: Swiney.\n\nSpeaker 2: Swiney Lane.\n\nSpeaker 1: Swiney Lane.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, copy that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do not be fooled.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be white diamond pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll say 100 on the top.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, Mr. Hispher, when you look at it, it's going to be sandy on the top, smooth on the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please do not take this with any alcohol, tobacco, ultra-processed food.\n\nSpeaker 2: Make sure it's home-style cooking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Something light like chicken and dumplings, you know, or something light like grits, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: something like this with, like, some tap fish.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then this stuff should set you straight like you have an AR-15, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll be able to lock in on your target and just click flush them out, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And let me know if it's a green light and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me at 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the charge for those?\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll make it the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Money doesn't mean a damn thing unless we can keep you going on your vitality, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we'll make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: I billed the doctor on this.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we'll just make it the same price as you got charged the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way, you know, you're just grandfathered in.\n\nSpeaker 1: But don't worry about that now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just cross this bridge, bud, and make sure it works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care of yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Godspeed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, stay warm down there, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a storm coming, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you all.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Be back.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
