    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello, hello, Amir, I'd like to say about cancelling a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull up the prescription now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Anselman?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so I see you have a prescription written by Dr. Meyers for 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need it? You refill every 30 days? Are you health-concerned?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need it. I didn't expect it to be coming every 30 days, so I want to go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you don't have to get it every 30 days. That's what the doctor wrote.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can advise the pharmacy to stop the 30 days from the original prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're going to put a pause. We're just going to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: From what I can see, you're not required to get it every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just that the doctor, because you got 10, thought that if you're an active person,\n\nSpeaker 1: you need at least 10 each month because there's 30 days during the month.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can stop that with the pharmacy, and they can pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: They usually pause up to half a year, so you don't have monthly anymore,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can order yourself because, like I said, monthly is not required.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can get it once or twice a year to lock your price in, but not every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that would work better for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Messaging the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Hanselman, I advise the pharmacy to stop the 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to pause for half a year, so you can reorder as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can get your refill, like I said, once or twice a year to lock your deal in,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that's about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to get it every 30 days, and I advise the pharmacy, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And they'll stop it indefinitely, not just for six months, but forever.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't want it to automatically stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to cancel the doctor prescription if you're not planning on reordering.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought you wanted to pause and reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're not ordering, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just be advised, if you try to reorder, if you see the order not going through,\n\nSpeaker 2: that means the company doesn't want to refinance that prescription because it costs behind here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if they do, they're going to change your price to reflect the new doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm canceling the doctor consultation here, canceling the VIP account, and you're all set, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
