    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I was wondering, is there a generic for the NuViagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, essentially, that NuViagra AGV is a generic pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what that AGV stands for, authorized generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What it is is that's just the generic version of the pill from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's their newest formula, so it's like a little bit updated.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's more powerful. It lasts a little longer in your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: It kicks in a little quicker, and we get the good price on it, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I've got some in my hands, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: When I ordered it, they sent me just regular, a 50-milligram generic for Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it didn't say AGV when I called last Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent me a new bottle, and the pills in the new bottle look just like the pills in the old bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: They should have a different marking on them,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they should have a different reading on the manufacturer's label as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like on the pill bottle, you should see the AGV indication.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you got, like, a replacement order sent out, you call, and you say,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, I got the wrong pills, and they're like, oh, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, we'll take care of that for you. We'll fix this. This is the right thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should see different markings on the new pills, or do they look the same?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the new pill has just the number 50 on one side.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all it's got.\n\nSpeaker 1: The old pill had AC339 on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm just trying to figure out, did I get the AGV or not?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so that new pill that says 50, that is the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are from, like, different manufacturers,\n\nSpeaker 1: completely different facilities that make them, those two pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so even the one that just says Sildenafil, Citrate, 50-milligram tablet, that's AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so any Viagra that doesn't get that blue coating is going to be called Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even, like, Viagra, the one with the blue coating from Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 1: the main ingredient is still Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just gets a different name because that's, like, their branded version of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's not important, the active ingredient, it's important where it comes from.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the manufacturer that makes it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I was confused.\n\nSpeaker 2: All the advertisement says, you know, it'll work in 11 minutes, yet both of these say,\n\nSpeaker 1: at least take one hour before, take one to two tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I don't want to be taking two of these and find out, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You won't have to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just so the manufacturer is protected for by chance if it takes you, like, longer than 11 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Takes you 20 minutes, takes you 30 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people would try to, like, sue the company that makes the pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's just so they're protected during an event like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do have to ask what I was just trying to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: So both of those bottles are probably AGV then?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the first one that has AC340, that's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: That comes from a different facility.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really similar to, like, the pills that the guys get from the VA.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's still a generic Viagra pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It comes from a different place.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to make sure before I started taking anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was a little confusing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: We get calls like this, I believe you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But no, it sounds like you got the right thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take the ones that say 50 on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.",
