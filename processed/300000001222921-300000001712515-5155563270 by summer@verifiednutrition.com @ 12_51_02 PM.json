    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling customer service, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I ordered, we started to order some pills for you guys and I closed the order off before I closed, I shut it off before I did it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But somehow they still sent me the prescription anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I called, and then I just kind of forgot about it, didn't think much of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I got another prescription sent to me, I never asked them to send me a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I was talking to the girl, she was telling me that, well, they sent you the wrong ones anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we got disconnected or she hung up or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called back and talked to another gentleman, he said, okay, that's fine, I'll just go ahead and cancel, I'll just go ahead and give you a refill on the second order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which I didn't think was right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, you know, hey, the girl that I talked to earlier said, hey, the first one they sent me was wrong anyway, which I didn't take any of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they sent me the wrong order to begin with because she sent me to look at the pill and give me the number off the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, well, that's not what you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I talked to the second guy, he said, okay, well, I'll close your account out and I'll give you a refund on the second one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, that's fine, I'll just split the difference with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you need to credit my credit card and can you send me a notification saying you're doing that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that was on Wednesday or Tuesday, I guess it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I never got anything from him.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if he would just, he said, well, I'll close your account and all that and I'll take care of this and I'll send you a notification saying I didn't either text or email.\n\nSpeaker 2: He did close your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I see an email, though, because he did close your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: What email did he send it to or he was supposed to send it to?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think the one I had on my account was nickr0856 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't see an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: But he did close your account out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But did he give me a refund on the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: He did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I didn't go to him.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were refunded $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: My next question, I'm trying to be nice about this, is they sent me the first order and they sent me the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I still have them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why should I have to pay for something that didn't even send me the right pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: She told me to go and get the pills and take one out and give me the number on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did that.\n\nSpeaker 2: She said, well, probably sent you the wrong one anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I'm not sure how that conversation transpired or what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get you to her, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly how it transpired.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me get you to her.\n\nSpeaker 1: She'd have more time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just tell me if they sent me the refund on the first pills or the second order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I said that.\n\nSpeaker 2: They refunded you the $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send me an email stating that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm going to let him know that you're still requesting that email.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll swallow the first ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I should have called right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but I didn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second one, I never signed up for a – I didn't finish signing up, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't sign up for a refill automatically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that pretty much standard?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that pretty much standard practice there?\n\nSpeaker 2: When you order one order, they automatically send you a note.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you order it online or did you do it over the phone?\n\nSpeaker 2: Online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, when you do it online, there's a box.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's kind of small, but the box you have to uncheck if you want to – if you don't want to be on an automatic.\n\nSpeaker 1: But he did cancel your account out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but can you get me a confirmation email that states that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what you got.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to take care of that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And let me tell you a little bit about the ADB.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to look very similar.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be the same, but the pill in the bottle is going to be a large, thick diamond pill\n\nSpeaker 2: with the number 1-0-0 on the back of the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you're going to know if that pill is ADB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the email says score blue refund verification,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it lets you know that you were refunded on the 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have to wait five days to see it in your account, but it was done two days ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait, you said it takes five days to do what?\n\nSpeaker 2: To show up in your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: They tell you that all the time, but you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: We're in a computerized world now.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we give you the refund, it should take your bank and my bank the same day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, maybe you should ask your bank why did it take five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the refund was done on the 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you sent me an email on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent you an email to nickr0856 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was it?\n\nSpeaker 1: nickr0856 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just can't believe that they would send you the wrong pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they wouldn't honor, I mean, probably do that to everybody.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it something about some of the customers, not all of them,\n\nSpeaker 1: the ones that are placing it online?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it doesn't happen when you're over the phone, obviously,\n\nSpeaker 1: because we work here.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's like some type of disconnect when some customers are placing it\n\nSpeaker 1: online versus over the phone, which we could have replaced the first one,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you canceled the account out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you cancel the account out, we can't make any activity on the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's kind of like stuck in a place where you just refunded your money.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how the second conversation went or what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told you exactly, word for word.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not trying to lie.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, I'm not saying that you're lying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing that you're saying is like far-fetched.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't know what was going through that gentleman's head\n\nSpeaker 1: or the conversation, why he wanted you to pay for something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't understand the logic of it, but I also wasn't on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: We wouldn't mind replacing it if you're saying, hey, I did this online.\n\nSpeaker 2: There was some kind of disconnect.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't want that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't want that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, we'll go ahead and we'll eat it and replace it\n\nSpeaker 1: and pay for the second pills, but you canceled the account out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we can't say anything for any canceled account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're doing it online, the advertiser is for the new AVT.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's like a drop-down of a list of pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I guess everybody's just selecting the first one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what my study is, but I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Admin is looking into it, but the first drop-down is not the correct pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the last one at the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not sure how it's happening, but they're looking into it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why would they even look at the old pills if your focus is on the new one?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you click on the link for the AGV, it pops up the right pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then customers are selecting the drop-down,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're switching it to the one that says AGV, which changes it to the regular one.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you just click the link and it auto-populates for the AGV\n\nSpeaker 2: and you don't change the drop-down, it won't change the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, anyway, I learned my lesson.\n\nSpeaker 2: I won't be ordering online.\n\nSpeaker 1: We got halfway through, so now let's just forget about this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought we had closed the order process out, but apparently we didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was so surprised when I got the refill a month later.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, what's this?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I didn't order it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've been more than helpful.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where do you live at?\n\nSpeaker 1: Los Angeles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so you're not getting all the crap that the East Coast is getting.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never liked the East Coast anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: My guy lives across from here.\n\nSpeaker 2: He lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's right in the path of all the freezing rain and everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for some reason, it was 20 miles east of him or west of him\n\nSpeaker 1: where the track came in and blasted open, but he didn't get anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I told him, I said, I have a top-down body, and I asked him to spare you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
