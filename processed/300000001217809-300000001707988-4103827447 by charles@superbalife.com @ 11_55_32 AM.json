I just got an e-mail from PayPal for a refill on a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: From you guys, and that's not the product that I want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Kenneth Horne in Wesley Chapel, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: What have you been getting?\n\nSpeaker 2: The generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Do you have the pills on you, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not on me right now. They're in the house.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take your word for it. Okay. Let me message my pharmacy right now, Kenneth. I will replace\n\nSpeaker 2: every single pill that you've had and the one that's sent out to you, okay, for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Completely our bad. Not sure what happened there. If it was a system error, it was a\n\nSpeaker 2: our fault. We'll make up for it. Either way, our stuff is all American made and made in\n\nSpeaker 1: France as well, so FDA approved as well. All of our stuff is very, very safe and healthy,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I will replace these pills for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: What I was trying to get was the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I had a feeling, so that's already what I was going to let my pharmacy know about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you. You just made this so easy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. We are very customer friendly here, Kenneth. If you ever need anything else, just\n\nSpeaker 1: give us a call and let us know, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be terrific. What was your name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's Charles. If you ever want me again, it's 0040 for my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Charles, I can't thank you enough. I was expecting some kind of battle and\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm flabbergasted and I'm grateful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. Tell your buddies.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So we're good?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I'd expect these ones to arrive on either Friday, Saturday, or next Monday, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles, thank you again, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. Hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
