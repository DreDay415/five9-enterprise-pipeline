Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: November the 2nd, 1958.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see your VIP status, Christopher, and you're right. It looks like the pharmacy made an error and sent you regular generic Viagras. Give me a second. I'm going to get you a replacement, and then I'll tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes it happens when the pharmacy runs out, and they don't tell us, and then they send regular generic Viagras, and it just creates a bunch of problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I put in the replacement. We'll be shipping it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, when you get this new bottle in the mail, this is how you can confirm you received the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the bottle, it's going to say AGB, but it's also going to say Greenstone, LLC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France that we're contracted with,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then on the individual pills, the only number imprinted on the pills is going to be the number 50 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm, because right now, your bottle says APCO, and then imprinted on your individual pills, it has the letters AC followed by the numbers 390 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, just go ahead and toss those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 339, yeah, the number on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just go ahead and throw those away.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you should be getting these in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
