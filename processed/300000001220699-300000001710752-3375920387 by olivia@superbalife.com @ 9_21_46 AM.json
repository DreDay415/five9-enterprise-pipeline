    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Lydia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, this is Anthony Edge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Anthony. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. I'm glad to hear it. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would like to cancel my subscription to School of Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Anthony. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-28-57.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 5065 Oneida Trail, Milton, Florida?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So I see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Anthony.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, just so you know, you certainly do not have to receive\n\nSpeaker 2: those regular monthly refills with your prescription if you do not want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you were interested in doing that, you could still order within the next six months\n\nSpeaker 2: or before July 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself,\n\nSpeaker 2: but that would just give you the opportunity to keep access to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, let me just go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds like a pretty good idea, but let me just go ahead and cancel it for now\n\nSpeaker 1: because I might be forgot by then to give you guys a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me cancel it, and if I run out of those two months, that's going to last me quite a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's just go ahead and cancel it for the time being.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will make me feel a little more comfortable knowing that it's already took care of for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we only pay for the doctor's approval one time.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you do cancel the prescription in total, because we offer the option to pause the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and of course, you know, if June rolled around or July rolled around either and you still had pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: you could just call us and say, hey, will you leave my prescription on hold\n\nSpeaker 1: because I still have like five pills or whatever it is because it looks like you have around 20,\n\nSpeaker 2: maybe like 18 now, so this would be the end of July.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then we could leave your prescription on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: But because we do offer that option, we do only pay for the doctor's one time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's just go ahead and cancel it for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Like I mentioned, I just want to make sure you understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, right. I'm okay with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I wanted to go back in there and open it back up, I'd have to pay for the doctor if it's past six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, period.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like if you ordered three days from now, you'd have to pay that fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, cool. I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I agree with that. That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last part of my job is to mention to you that if the pills weren't working for you for any reason,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do technically qualify for a current promotional offer we're doing,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is we are sending out a free sample of 10 pills of their newest, highest quality stuff\n\nSpeaker 2: to folks who haven't tried it, which it looks like that includes you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The free sample is 10 pills, and it comes with a six-month trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 10 pills of the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: They come directly from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then my favorite thing about them is that we've specifically formulated them\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you did want to try them, it would be 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then that prescription that is started with a free sample would be placed on hold for you until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what we believe would happen based off of the data and the research\n\nSpeaker 1: and the reviews is within the next two to five months, you would run out of those,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd really like them, and you'd call us to order some more.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you'd set up the script how you want it, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I forget to call you guys, are you going to automatically send me a six-month update?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's a free product, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm talking about so in six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: am I going to get billed for a prescription that I might have forgotten about?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it just going to drop completely out at that time?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you use the product, are you not going to use 10 pills in the next six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just go ahead and cancel it for today.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's canceled regardless.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want the free sample or not?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, uh-uh.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want the free sample, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we'd love to have you back to try that product.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would have to purchase it, and we are the only sellers in the entire world,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we paid a lot of money to be able to say that, so there's nowhere else you can get it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can do that research yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: But because you denied the free sample, which I'll have to make a note of,\n\nSpeaker 2: we just wouldn't be able to send it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I hope you have a great day, Anthony.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So are you going to send me an e-mail?\n\nSpeaker 2: We all send me an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want to send me an e-mail confirming the cancellation?",
