    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Wendell Goodall.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Wendell. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good. Well, I was better until you guys took a payment out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I did purchase something from you December 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it was just a one-time purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you guys just took out the same amount out of my account again.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's the last bit of money I've got, so I'm in trouble.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why. I mean, I didn't order a monthly plan or nothing like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can look into this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the phone number that's going to be associated with your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: if it's not this one that you just called in on?\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be that one if I had a number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and what's the number?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1-2-4-9-7-4-5-3-8.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you said 4-1-2.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, 8-1-2.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 8-1-2-4-9-7-4-5-3-8.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what's your date of birth, Lyndall?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-3-1966.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, and you're located in Henderson, Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, yeah, so I do see that order was a refill and it has already been shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want regular refills, you certainly don't have to receive them\n\nSpeaker 1: with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months\n\nSpeaker 1: at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire\n\nSpeaker 2: if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order again,\n\nSpeaker 2: if it is before then you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if you want a refund for this most recent one, you can definitely have that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you receive it in the next, it'll probably be tomorrow or, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: maybe Saturday, Monday at the very latest, but probably tomorrow or Saturday,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can just write return to sender on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you do not open it, they will bring it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we ship out of Kentucky, so that should get back to us very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the minute we receive it, we can just refund it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can leave a note in your file that you're going to write return to sender on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but see, I didn't order anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why they did that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was just a one-time thing to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was all my money I have in my bank account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I lost my job last week, and now, you know, something's coming.\n\nSpeaker 1: You took it out of my account, and I never wanted anything like that to happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was just I paid with my debit card just one time, so I don't understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you're saying I'm going to have to wait?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have no money, and I don't understand why they ship it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the answer to that is when you place the order online,\n\nSpeaker 2: the order said that every prescription, so there was a message that you received,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it said every prescription will probably come with doctor refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to change those or you want to place them on hold, call this number,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that number was this number of us that you're talking to right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And because you ordered 10 pills initially for your initial prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 pills is usually what the pharmacy approved for once per month.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you order more, then it's every two months, three months, four months,\n\nSpeaker 1: unless you give us a call, which people do all day and say,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, I don't need those every month or every two months or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Leave my prescription on hold or whatever you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, because we didn't hear from you or you didn't call us\n\nSpeaker 1: and because that message was sent to you, that's why that happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: When was the message sent? I've never gotten a message like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just getting it one time, and it was supposed to be like 20-some dollars,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it said for $10 more or something, you could get 10 more pills or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they charged me $60, and it was only supposed to be like $20.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't even know how that started off to start with.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not real happy with how things have happened, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Especially now you get this. Now I don't have any money.\n\nSpeaker 1: I only had like $80 in my bank account, and we took that $63 out of there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I never got no message.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I talked to whoever I ordered it from, they never said anything about, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: that this would be an ongoing thing. It was just a one-time try.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's nowhere where we order that's ever been that says your order is a one-time order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the terms that I mentioned that are in writing, you agree to when you place the order\n\nSpeaker 1: because the screen popped up when you placed the order that said that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, unfortunately the best I can do is just that, you know, you live in Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: We ship out of Kentucky. You'll probably get it by tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just write return to sender on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And once your post person is bringing it back to us, you can even call us earlier.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, like you could email us Saturday morning and say, hey, I did this return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you should be able to pull up that tracking number and use it to confirm.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really need this refund immediately, and they should be able to get it back to you then.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I could take it down to the post office and have them send it back to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: if they give a tracking number for you guys, would I be able to get the money back tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I know if I get it tomorrow, you won't get it back in Kentucky tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I, like, take it back to the post office and they could put a tracking,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can call you with the tracking number, and then they would refund my money or no?\n\nSpeaker 2: You've got to have it in your hands first.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we should be able to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can leave some notes that this refund is, you know, that you really need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, yeah, we should be able to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, good. That's what I'll do then. I'll just take it down to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what do I need to get from the post office?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a paper showing where it's been sent off or it's been sent back to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Honestly, the best success you're going to have is just as long as you don't open it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, well, yeah, I guess you don't want to do return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here's what I'll do. I'll email you the instructions for the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: The email we have on file is lgoodall4t05 at gmail.com. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I will send that to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then I'll just take that to the post office when I get it and then call you back, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or the quickest way, but it's going to tell you this in the email.\n\nSpeaker 2: The quickest way will be to respond to the email with the tracking number,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then they will be able to process it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. So tracking number, I'm not really sure about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would I get that at the post office, I guess, when I send it off, send it back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you very much. You've been great. I'm sorry it has happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: My sister's having heart surgery this weekend. My dad has to move this weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: He can't keep it. He's going to be homeless.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything's hit me at once, and then I see this, and I'm like,\n\nSpeaker 2: now I don't even have money to go help him move.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know. Stories all the time, everybody, but this is, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you are not any specific way. I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you've been a lot of help. As soon as I get that package, I'll check it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I won't come today, because you just probably sent it out yesterday, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I won't come. Okay. Alrighty. Well, I'll be looking forward to mail,\n\nSpeaker 1: and thank you. Have a great day, hon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Thank you, Wendell. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.",
