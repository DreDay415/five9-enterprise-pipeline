    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Jimmy, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm trying to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me see if I can help you with that. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try to pull your information up with the number you're calling from.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a number, 346-885-9208, and that is coming up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there another phone number you might have used when you did your order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, give me just one second. Let me pull it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, I'm driving, but I'm pulling over.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Take your time. Be safe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What number did you say you have?\n\nSpeaker 1: The one you're calling from is 346-885-9208.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 346-858-0521.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's 346-858-0521?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me try it another way then, because nothing's coming up under that one either.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your zip code? Give me your zip code. I'll try to flip that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: 77327.\n\nSpeaker 2: 77327. And can I get your name, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Donald Williams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Donald Williams. Okay, Donald, I think I was able to find you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the number that I had was an 832 number, 832-491-2961.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that ring a bell for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's my old number. I no longer have that number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Before we go any further, I just want to make sure I get your new number in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure we get that right in case you ever call back again for any reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I got that new number updated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I was able to pull your account up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you're currently getting the Viagra, 50 milligrams, 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and take care of your requests for you first of all.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I do see your prescription. How did you get them every month?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I was able to do for you, I went ahead and I stopped those monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also stopped the monthly refills that was included in your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I stopped the monthly charges as well for you, Donald.\n\nSpeaker 2: Donald, I'm looking at your account, and I'm wondering, you were getting the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: How was those working out for you when you used those?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they were working out good. I just didn't need that many,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I thought it was a one-time order. I didn't know that y'all were going to keep sending it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem. What we can do, Donald, because you do have a prescription with us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if one time, I mean every month is too often, we can also pause your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So therefore, you can keep your prescription on file,\n\nSpeaker 1: and therefore, when you do want to reorder, you'll be locked in at that lower price\n\nSpeaker 2: that you're getting compared to what the price would be by not having a prescription on file\n\nSpeaker 1: because our pills do come from the labs in Fraser, France,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the tariffs are going to hit pretty soon on those,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the same pills that you're getting now are going to cost almost three times as much\n\nSpeaker 2: once the tariffs hit, but because you do have an active prescription with us,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can still get them at this discounted price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but will it start back automatically, or do I have to call in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what I can do, I can postpone the shipment for like six months, five or six months for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and therefore, what that does, that allows you time to use your pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you want to postpone it further than that, you just give us a call to say,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, I still have one or two left. I want to wait a few more months. I can do that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and this allows you to order before then as well to keep your discounted prescription in play.\n\nSpeaker 2: So therefore, you're just not totally just getting rid of your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you did that, it would be kind of tough to order in the future\n\nSpeaker 2: because we're on a first-come, first-served basis,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we usually take care of our prescriptions and first-time orders first.\n\nSpeaker 2: So rather than just cancel it out, I can postpone it for like about five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: For instance, like the next one was scheduled to come out in February.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can push that all the way back almost to like June, and if June comes too soon,\n\nSpeaker 1: just give us a call because you are one of the VIP clients with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're currently a VIP, and I'm escalating it to elite status,\n\nSpeaker 1: which allows you to be in more control of your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you just call us before June and say, hey, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I still want to hold off, so push me back another few months so we can do that,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you can order any time before then and keep the same discounted rate.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I'll just go ahead and cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, like I said, again, if you cancel it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you said the pills are working pretty good for you too, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: The Viagra, the 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, but I had to sit on the phone for 30 minutes to wait to talk to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to do it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me tell you why, Donald, because you're in Texas and we're on the West Coast,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we don't start as early as you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we just opened up like about 30 minutes ago as far as that's concerned,\n\nSpeaker 1: and everybody's trying to get these new A and G pills that I'm looking at.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you know what I want to do for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you decide to go ahead and do what I'm trying to suggest,\n\nSpeaker 2: and postpone for, you know, like six months or five months or so,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to want to send you out 10 for free, but you got the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want you to try the 100 milligrams of the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: because what's the difference of the AGB is it works faster, it lasts longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it doesn't come with those same side effects a lot of people used to get\n\nSpeaker 1: with the generic Viagra, which is like the dizziness and the headaches\n\nSpeaker 2: and the upset stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I guarantee you these are going to work so much better,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm willing to give you 10 for you to try at no charge,\n\nSpeaker 1: and these are not going to be on that every month situation.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you like about five or six months or so,\n\nSpeaker 1: anything I offer I'll give you at first to try these to see how they work out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you said it starts back up in June?\n\nSpeaker 2: It will be in June.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can always call before then to say, hey, push me back another few months,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you can always call and order before then if you want to,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you will be on the lead VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as I say again, this is going to be a new and improved Viagra pill that I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: going to see 10 out now just to try for free,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're not going to get any more into that around that time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to change the prescription to be these,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I know you're going to really love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so no charges still due.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And check out the ones I'm sending you, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to be the same white-shaped diamond.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not charging for these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sending these out to you, no charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to be a white-shaped diamond pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're going to see a drastic difference in those and no other charges,\n\nSpeaker 1: like I say again, until you're ready to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or until June comes, you can always call us and push it back if you want to,\n\nSpeaker 1: to keep your active prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, Donald.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call and ask for me when you're ready to reorder as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.",
