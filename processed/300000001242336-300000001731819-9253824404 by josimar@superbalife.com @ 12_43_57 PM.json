    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Bill Lenson, and I've been buying the Blue Scores pills for a while, and I want to cancel the order. I've got too many pills and haven't used them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that, sir. What is your last name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Lenson, L-E-N-S-O-N, 85298.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty, so you're currently a VIP member for the Viagra AGV, sir. The moment I cancel out these orders, you won't be able to access this in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you sure you didn't want to just freeze your account out?\n\nSpeaker 1: We can always freeze it out for you, that way you can retain access to the script and not lose it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what I don't want is the next order sent to me, that's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to freeze it, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll go ahead and freeze it out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe I can freeze it for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call us up when you're ready to order it again, though. I'll be more than happy to help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, appreciate it. Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
