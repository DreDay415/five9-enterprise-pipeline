    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hi, Larry Burgum calling. My order number is RX-9935650. And you guys\n\nSpeaker 2: need an automatic replenishment. I never ordered automatic replenishment, so I want to cancel\n\nSpeaker 1: that, number one. Okay. Mr. Larry Burgum? Burgum, B-U-R-G-U-M, birthday 6-15-1955. Okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: from what I can see, Mr. Larry, Dr. Lee wrote a prescription for Viagra 50 mg and I think\n\nSpeaker 1: since you were getting 10 tablets, there was 30 days a month, so he got you on a refill\n\nSpeaker 2: every 30 days. I don't want that, sir. Sir, I didn't order that. I ordered a one-time\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription of 10 tablets. Sir, I heard your concern. Do you mind me letting you know what\n\nSpeaker 2: I see so you can resolve your issue? No, I want you to cancel my automatic replenishment.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm not getting Viagra HGV, which I should be getting. I'm getting just the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you a prescription for that. You guys really screwed this whole thing up. You\n\nSpeaker 1: want a replacement with the HGV? Look at my original orders. On my order it says Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: HGV. I get the bottle and it says generic Viagra. That's why I'm trying to go over the\n\nSpeaker 1: information in your account so we can investigate all of those little details and results. That's\n\nSpeaker 2: what I'm trying to do. I heard your concern. If you let me do it, I can find some good\n\nSpeaker 1: solution for you. Well, I just want you to, number one, cancel the rest of my orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want them anymore. That's number one I want. I don't want automatic. I'll get a\n\nSpeaker 1: hold of you if I want more. I don't want automatic replenishment. And I heard you at the beginning\n\nSpeaker 2: of the call, so you don't need to repeat yourself. I heard you. I don't understand what you're\n\nSpeaker 1: saying, sir. I heard you at the beginning of the call. What I was saying is Dr. Liu had\n\nSpeaker 2: the prescription with refills. What I think happened is that he got you on the refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you don't have to get those refills. Right, I don't want to. I advise the pharmacy to stop\n\nSpeaker 2: the original prescription. You're just going to order as needed, which allows you to lock\n\nSpeaker 1: price in and not get refill every 30 days. Maybe you can get your refill once or twice,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you're just to lock that price, right? And I heard that you say that you didn't receive\n\nSpeaker 1: the order. For some reason, when you place your order, the pharmacy fulfilled what they received,\n\nSpeaker 2: which seems to be just regular sildenafil. So maybe it was a glitch in our website,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I can replace your pills by the actual Viagra HEV, okay? Do you have a pill in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 2: A bottle? I have the bottle in front of me, yes. Okay, can you grab one of the\n\nSpeaker 1: pills and just tell me real quick what is the code on the actual pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: It just says on here, Viagra citrate, 50 milligrams, generic for Viagra. It doesn't\n\nSpeaker 1: say Viagra HEV. Okay, so let me, what I'm going to do, and the pill, can you grab one of the\n\nSpeaker 2: actual pills? What is on the actual pill engraved, if you don't mind? It doesn't say on...\n\nSpeaker 1: There is a code on the pill, if you can tell me. The actual pill, grab the pill, the single pill\n\nSpeaker 2: that you drink, the pill, the actual pill. Let me know what is engraved on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what you're asking me. So, a Viagra pill, the diamond-shaped pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: the pills that you had in the bottle, can you grab one of the pills? Yes, I will, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want me to read the number to you? Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: AC339. All right. Yeah, no, that's, that's not, I don't know why your order came this way. I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: going to send you a replacement with HEV, it should say 5-0. That's the new formula. Right,\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, both, sir, both orders, and I didn't order the second order, but you automatically\n\nSpeaker 1: punished them. Both orders have been the AC339. And I just say, I'm going to send you a replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: for both orders. Okay, I'm not paying for it. Why would you pay for it, sir? You already paid for\n\nSpeaker 1: both orders. Why would I charge you for sending a replacement when you explained to me that you\n\nSpeaker 2: didn't get the right stuff? Right, please send me the right stuff, and I don't want automatic,\n\nSpeaker 1: I will call you from now on if I want the AGV, or the other one. And that's what we're going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I heard your concern very clearly. Okay. And I'm going to give you a prescription. It's going to\n\nSpeaker 1: be for half a year, so no more monthly. And I'm going to send you a replacement. And because you\n\nSpeaker 2: got the wrong stuff, you're going to get 25 pills instead of 20. We agree that you pay for 20,\n\nSpeaker 1: right? But I'm going to send you 25, okay? Okay, for free, no cost, right? No cost, sir. You already\n\nSpeaker 2: paid for your order. It doesn't make sense to charge you again for replacement. It doesn't\n\nSpeaker 1: make sense. Right. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. All right. Bye-bye. Yeah, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye. Bye-bye.",
