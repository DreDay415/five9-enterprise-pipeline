    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 2: The wonderful and amazing Mr. Gray, Lawrence Gray.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, how you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, I just wanted to give you a ring and let you know that I'm still thinking of you,\n\nSpeaker 1: praying for you, and I'm sorry I didn't call you on Christmas or even after New Year,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we got swamped here and I barely had any time off.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I did, I took it to be with a good old Lord.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got your message.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was going to call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just hadn't got to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, I appreciate you and I appreciate you thinking of me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tell you, that's a real treat.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew you'd been busy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, I wanted to make sure I have your name on my desk so I always look at you\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm like, okay, I got a couple minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to try to give him a call, you know, because I don't control.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't control calls because they all come in, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just come in.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're like tracers, you know, like flying bullets.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just come in and I just got to take them.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when there's a little gap and it slows down, I'm like, okay, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I call, I try to call at 8 o'clock your time, you know, because I know that's when you start work.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the best time to call is like around this time where it slows down because we mostly deal with like your time,\n\nSpeaker 1: Eastern time, and we're here in L.A.\n\nSpeaker 2: But nevertheless, you know, I'm glad that we connected, Mr. Gray,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I really just appreciate you as a human being, a good old American, you know, baby boomer,\n\nSpeaker 2: a Christian man, you know, and good old like ancestor of Tennessee.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's where my grandma's from, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you told me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I got to go make my way over there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a bunch of like aunties and uncles that actually never even met me because I was born and raised in Guam\n\nSpeaker 1: and went to school in Washington.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I just wanted to call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know you're watching your show, but I just wanted to let you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm just glad you called me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your kind words because I know you talk to a lot of people,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I feel like I'm a treat or I think a lot because you kind of single me out, and I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have much names on my desk, but I got your name on my desk,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just try to make note when I do make a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is everything going good this year for you, your health?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you get that batch I sent you to run that play, the 25?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm using them.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're good?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're good?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're probably better than I am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll probably have to get some more at some point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, whenever you're ready, you know, like I said, you can use the dashboard, call me.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way it works with that one, you have enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as you – the caveat is as long as you can maintain 20 pills a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: sometimes in the 2020s, you'll be good to go because actually since December,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're all sold out of that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: But don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have me, Mr. Gray.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I need some more, I can call you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just call me and we'll get you going because unless you want to use the dashboard on your phone\n\nSpeaker 2: and just order through your phone, but I don't know how you feel about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just didn't know what I could get.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, I'll pay for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'll give you my credit card number.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can charge it whenever.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you tell me.\n\nSpeaker 2: You tell me, like as long as you get it, like just tell me when you're going to run out\n\nSpeaker 1: because if you – just tell me when you're going to run out,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the minimum refills for this type of quality and the 100 milligrams is two refills a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: So as long as you get it twice a year, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: But as long as it's 20 pills, but you still got some back.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should still have some back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should still have some.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Our sisters have what now?\n\nSpeaker 2: You should still have some left.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm good for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't sweat it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't fret.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got you your refunds, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You got bolster refunds.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, everything that you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I hope – I sent, you know, a letter to your supervisor, and I think he got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope it's helped.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to go back.\n\nSpeaker 1: It really helped.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes we need all the help we can get, don't we, sometimes?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, dude, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, and you're an angel.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're an angel to me to write that letter.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were the first review that I ever had starting this, and I want to keep going.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they've been very, very kind to me, you know, as a veteran.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, like God's been good to me too, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I had a hard one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was an orphan, stuff like that, but I was – during COVID I was homeless for almost three years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, it's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, you're tough.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I respect, you know, what you've done.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you've had a hard time, and you're hanging in there, and you do whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know what, you know, I don't live in – I just – I don't live of the world.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just live in the world, and I'm a witness, and I'm a servant.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, I know that my true calling is when we go up to the good old Lord,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, I'm not that person.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the main thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the main thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the main thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I practice on looking past all these earthly desires and carnal desires\n\nSpeaker 2: and just be of service, sir, because I can't – I don't measure success on money or things or stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I measure success on, you know, on God's word.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, on, like, what he says, if that was what I did, you know, if that was –\n\nSpeaker 1: if that's what he calls me to do and I didn't do it, I better check myself, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, you're – you know what it's all about.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're a very humble person.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to leave you with these words, too, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to leave you with Mark 11.24.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I say to you, my brethren, Mr. Lawrence Gray, therefore I say to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you will receive them\n\nSpeaker 1: and you will have them in Jesus' mighty name, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's Mark 11.24.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mark 11 what?\n\nSpeaker 2: 24.\n\nSpeaker 1: 11.24, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to read you some more.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a good verse.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a good verse.\n\nSpeaker 1: Therefore I say to you, my brethren, whatever things you ask when you pray,\n\nSpeaker 2: believe that you receive them and you will have them.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what it says.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sure do appreciate you calling me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you bet.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be checking in on you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going into my six-month mark, and I'm going to be with you, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to check in with you from time to time, and who knows?\n\nSpeaker 2: Be careful on that freeway going home.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be happy for me because I've actually haven't got a place since I\n\nSpeaker 2: moved out here for nearly six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was staying in my car.\n\nSpeaker 2: The owner knew I was staying in my car.\n\nSpeaker 1: They gave me some money to get a hotel, and I was going from hotel to hotel,\n\nSpeaker 2: like motel.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it was very, very hard switching everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I finally got a place this last weekend, and I moved in after five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I just treat it sort of like how Jesus was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Jesus, he was homeless.\n\nSpeaker 1: He just went from town to town.\n\nSpeaker 2: He slept by the fig trees.\n\nSpeaker 1: He put his back to the wall, like, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's what also, like, the Indians did, the American Indians,\n\nSpeaker 1: put their back against the, you know, and they prayed.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just looked at it like this was just an adventure, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like the road less traveled.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I finally got a place, and you'd be proud of me.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's only a two-minute drive and nine-minute walk.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, great, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm glad to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm glad to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now I just need to maintain it, continue.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not easy to get it, but the hardest part is maintaining it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like a bride, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Every man wants a bride, but can they maintain a bride?\n\nSpeaker 2: Everybody wants a house, but can they maintain the house?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a lot of upkeep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I know it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It takes so much money to do anything anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just unreal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I hope you get a good tax return.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think Trump was supposed to order us, because Trump was supposed to order us\n\nSpeaker 1: to have almost double our tax return.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I hope you get something handsome back, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought today I got to start working on mine now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, start working on that so you can get ahead of it\n\nSpeaker 1: and get it back sooner than most,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I think you should be getting something back good and handsome,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I pray that be the case and it's covered and sealed by the blood of Jesus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you bet, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Always and forever, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll let you go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to go, and I want to make these other calls that are coming in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for taking a few minutes of your time and calling me,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I know you're still working, because it's not quite 5 o'clock your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be checking in on you, Mr. Gray.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't go anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't go anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 2: Damn it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Damn you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You keep fighting, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep pushing and keep those AGVs, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Have fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to have injection in my eye tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been doing that for the last year or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm tough, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're Gray.\n\nSpeaker 1: Remember what I said, 50 Shades of Gray, like that movie, 50 Shades of Gray.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate you calling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good night.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you bet.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good night.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
