    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Jimmy, this is a doctor, let me...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I have spoken to...\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you're the fourth person I've spoken to\n\nSpeaker 1: about the amount of prescriptions that I'm getting.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the last person I spoke to had changed my number\n\nSpeaker 1: that I was going to get delivered to...\n\nSpeaker 2: We were holding off till March, and we were doing three months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got one last month, and now I got the 12 for three months today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, this is ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I do see that... I'm looking at the account there, doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you are set up to get them every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it looks like the next month is scheduled for April the 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, how could I... No, I told them...\n\nSpeaker 2: What I told them, and I was very clear,\n\nSpeaker 1: that to hold off until March,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they kept sending me more...\n\nSpeaker 1: I called previous and asked them to change the script from six to four,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they still sent me... continued to send me six.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the price was, you know, was the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I asked them to change it to four and hold off till March.\n\nSpeaker 1: That didn't happen. I don't see that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, I see that they sent you 12, actually, in the January one.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's 12 of them that were sent to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm just trying to explain what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm trying to explain what I'm seeing. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, okay, let me do this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those 12, if you don't want those now, you don't have to use them.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I can do for you, since you want it every three months,\n\nSpeaker 1: since you got so many, I can push that back further for you\n\nSpeaker 2: so you're not getting them in April,\n\nSpeaker 1: because obviously you've got more than enough on hand if you want to do four.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can push that out to, I say, six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, therefore, you won't get another one until...\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me do that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll tell you exactly what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll change that to six right now at the top.\n\nSpeaker 1: So with that being said, the next one's not going to come until July 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I can change the quantity for you too, because the quantity wasn't changed.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was changed as 12 instead of six, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was changed, but it didn't go the direction you were asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, they sent me 12 because it's supposed to be every three months,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they sent it to me two months early.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I heard what you said, and I'm looking at what it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now my next question is, for the one that's coming in July 23rd,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's what I have it set up for, how many did you want to get in that one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want it to remain at 12, or did you want to change the dosage to another dosage?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, 12 is fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: For every three months, it's four.\n\nSpeaker 2: Every month is fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, that's what I just did for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so now what am I going to be charged for this 12 that you just sent me?\n\nSpeaker 1: That 12 was $103.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was supposed to be $40-something or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it was probably going to be four instead of 12.\n\nSpeaker 2: You see what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because for six you were paying $74.\n\nSpeaker 2: Six you were paying $74, so you're getting a discount with 12 at $103.\n\nSpeaker 1: The more you get, the cheaper it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you were getting four, you were paying $54.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's back in September.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were getting four and paying $54.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then you went to six, and you paid $74.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you went to 12, you're paying $103.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're getting a discount the more you're getting as far as that's concerned.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's how that works.\n\nSpeaker 1: But right now, that's why I said I'm going to set you up for every six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you'll be getting 12.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this allows you to order any time you want to in between then too\n\nSpeaker 2: if you seem to run out before July, you can just call and order again.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I am not going to get another thing until July 23rd?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's on the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I just did it right now for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
