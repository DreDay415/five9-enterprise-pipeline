    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I received an order from Scorablue a few days ago, or Phil Denafow, Phil? Okay, from the Scorablue company.\n\nSpeaker 1: The prescription bottle does not have anything about the... all it says is basically just Viagra, not the Viagra that's on your ads and things. What's going on with that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, so you're under the impression you might have gotten the wrong thing there. You said this is Mr. Grog?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your... do you have those pills there with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do the markings say on the actual physical pill? Let me know, please, Mr. Grog.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I can get this lid off of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your time. Yeah, if you did get the incorrect thing, I will definitely send you a replacement order stat, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so those are incorrect, Mr. Grog. Those are very similar to what those guys get from the VA. They're still generic Viagra, but it's definitely not our AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do for you, I have you at 1607 Osceola Street, Johnson City. I'm going to, of course, send you a replacement order at no cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to expedite this. You'll see it come out in the next few days, probably by Tuesday at the latest. I'm really sorry about that mix-up there.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's no problem. You might want to alert the people at Go-Go Meds that they've got a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, no, they're working on it. We have gotten a few other calls like this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so this came out of the pharmacy in Southgate, Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's where we ship out of, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, I'm going to alert them now, and you'll see this order come out really soon next week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I appreciate your help. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Sam. Bye-bye now.",
