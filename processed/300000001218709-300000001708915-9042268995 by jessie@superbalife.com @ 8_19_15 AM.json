And then Mr. Bartle, what is your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 32225.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you at 12547 Rock Rose Lane in Jacksonville, Florida?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect. So it looks like you ordered the 50 milligrams and 10 pills recently and—\n\nSpeaker 1: You have an issue with your order. What can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean all of your ads talk about your what, AGV or ABG ad to the Viagra—\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't get that, and that's what I expected to get. Oh—\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, do you have the bottle there with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, give me a second. I'll grab it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it in my hand now. Okay. Um, could you take out one of the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so if you look at it, on one side it's smooth, the other side of the pill, can you tell me what the imprint is?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's not printed with anything easy to see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very hard to read.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it look like a 50 or does it look like something else?\n\nSpeaker 2: Looks like a three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Looks like a three, a three?\n\nSpeaker 2: Flashlight, right? Make it easy. Oh my goodness.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, if it's anything—okay, take your time, take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the pill, so it is a C 3 3 9.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no, you're correct, that's not the right pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the US manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here's what I'll do. I'm going to replace your pills and—\n\nSpeaker 1: Have it priority shipped to you. Okay. I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Bartle—\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll get that replaced for you. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: The allure to the product, of course, is you're getting—you've taken the basic and your turbo charge. That's what I believe from ads.\n\nSpeaker 1: Try to find something that I can take and expect certain results.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this is absolutely nothing for ya. No, no, no, we want you to get the French one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna have this reshipped to you clearly at no cost to you, a full replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'll have it shipped with priority so you get it in the next two, three days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm so, so sorry about that, but you'll get this in the mail shortly. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good day. Bye, bye.",
