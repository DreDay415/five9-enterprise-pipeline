I got Ron Eckerman in Caldwell, Texas, or excuse me, Kansas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Yeah, the cancellation button isn't on the website anywhere,\n\nSpeaker 1: because if you accidentally press it, it's a whole discrepancy thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've got to reorder the prescription and whatnot,\n\nSpeaker 1: so we'd rather just have everybody call in and request anything over the phone\n\nSpeaker 2: with one of us.\n\nSpeaker 1: With your situation, do you just not need any type of refills at the moment?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had some from my last one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I received them, and then I just got this order, so I have money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me reverse that, and then what I'll do,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll postpone any future one from now until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you've got some time to kill what you've got and call in\n\nSpeaker 2: and request it if you need it a little bit earlier,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they won't come as often as they have been.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be like whenever you need it at that point as well, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sounds good. Let me do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Everything's done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Ron. Hope you have a great rest of your day, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
