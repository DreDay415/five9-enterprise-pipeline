How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Scott and I just got done placing an order for a prescription of the Viagra AGV and I\n\nSpeaker 1: had started this actually yesterday and then I closed it down and then I had\n\nSpeaker 2: received an email from some David with Score Blue and he said that if I were to\n\nSpeaker 1: click on that link that they were going to... I can help you, Scott. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's July 9, 1957.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Okay, so I see, yeah, there's like a handful of like five states where the state requirements for the\n\nSpeaker 2: telehealth medicine is that the doctor has to verify your identity, so they sent\n\nSpeaker 1: you a link with—they sent you a text message with\n\nSpeaker 2: a link to click and all you have to do is click that link and just upload a\n\nSpeaker 1: short video of yourself, just say your name and date of birth. That way the\n\nSpeaker 2: doctor can verify. I actually did all that already. I'm not sure what the\n\nSpeaker 1: account is showing, but you know what had happened—I was going to pay for it\n\nSpeaker 2: by PayPal and I noticed that the amount, you know, when I last looked at it, it\n\nSpeaker 1: said I was going to be charged $99 in total.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, there's a $14.95 processing fee from the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well then on top of that, what I'm kind of\n\nSpeaker 2: getting at too, so based on this email that I received, they were going to give\n\nSpeaker 1: me a $15 discount, so it should have been—\n\nSpeaker 2: okay, at least okay, there's the $14.95 processing fee, which of course nothing was said about, but anyway, that is what\n\nSpeaker 1: it is. But I should have started out with $84 plus the processing fee, not $99 plus\n\nSpeaker 2: the processing fee. You know, I clicked on the link that said I was supposed to get\n\nSpeaker 1: the $15 discount.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that didn't happen for some crazy reason.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on one second. I'm going to get you someone who can help you.",
