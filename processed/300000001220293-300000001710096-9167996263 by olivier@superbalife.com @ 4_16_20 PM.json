I'm pulling your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Donald Gross?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see your prescription is not...\n\nSpeaker 1: It seems that it's cancer from what I can see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I keep getting pills every month and that's...\n\nSpeaker 1: That's kind of weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got a package today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Really? I see that... Oh, wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that the last refill process... This is called blue, Viviagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: The last refill was processed in November.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see when that was delivered. I'm just curious to see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. So that was probably the old one from November, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they probably hold it and then he just... They finally sent it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I see that it was processed in November 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, even though...\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I remember it was just delivered to, sure enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I think they processed that before and they just hold it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't need it, I can advise the pharmacy to pause and you just hold it as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to get it as often. That's not required.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get it once or twice a year, same quantity, less quantity, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'd be nice if I could just suspend it and then go back in and get it when I need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But like I said, I just got another package.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got another one last month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, was it last month?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know. I just don't remember getting this one or ordering it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. That one was processed in November.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I think they hold it and then they finally send it to you probably a few days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it was processed in November.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't processed in December or in January.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I see last order here say 11-28.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I see that tracking number is showing me the 27 deliveries of today.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I can do, I can have them pausing you up to half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: And please note that you want your refill maybe once or twice a year, but no more on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or if it can just be suspended until I want it again, I can go in and just get over it at that time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause it for half a year and then just to preserve the doctor consultation to avoid your price to go up.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, just call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just call and give an update at any time or place your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a quick refill button activated in your dashboard, in your account, or you can call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Yeah, give us a call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm letting them to take you off for half a year or at least.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you're going to call in between to kind of let us know if you need a order or, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, we take care of your account that you like and just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. I'll, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Spend it for at least half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got plenty of pills at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. We don't need to send you anything if you have enough left.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
