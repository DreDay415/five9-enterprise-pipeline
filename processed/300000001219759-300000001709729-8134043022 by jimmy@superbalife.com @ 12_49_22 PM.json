I'm one of your customers and I placed an order a week or so ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I believe, I forget the name of the gentleman I spoke to, but I believe I ordered 10 tablets of the SCORE Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I'm not mistaken, while we were discussing the order, he asked me if I wanted to increase it by 10 more.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he'd give me an additional price for the extra 10 and I thought I said yes, do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I just got my order today in the mail and there's just 10 tablets in the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just wanted to make sure that I didn't get billed for those extra 10 because I did not get the 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you did not get billed for the extra 10. You just paid for the actual 10 that comes with the first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you paid for 10 and you got 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pretty sure that he offered me I could do an additional 10 and I thought I said yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: James, you spoke to me actually. I'm the one that took your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah. I was sure you said no, not at this time because you wanted to try these first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then you're correct. I remember you asking me if I wanted to make an additional purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: For a little bit reduced price and I thought maybe I said, but okay, you're great. I got it today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't, of course, had a chance to even try them out and won't for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because my lady friend that's coming to live with me is not going to be here for another month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway, that's all I wanted to know. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem. You take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll stay in touch.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. See you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
