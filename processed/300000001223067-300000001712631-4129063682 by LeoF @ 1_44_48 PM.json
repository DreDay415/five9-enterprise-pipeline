    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I'm just making sure I got the right product. I ordered last week and received Viagra, 100-milligram dose. It doesn't say anything about being the new Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, what's your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mike Fanto, F like in Frank, A-N-T-O.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Fanto, do you have those pills there in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please take one out for me and let me know what the markings on both sides say.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be able to identify it. Yeah, because what I got just says it's regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on one second. It says AC-340 on one side.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's incorrect, Mr. Fanto.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can just let you know right away. I'm really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does sound like you got our regular generic pill, very similar to like what the guys get at the VA and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a mistake, most likely just machine error. That's how the prescriptions are filled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to fix this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to have to send you a replacement order stat, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send that out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be at no cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be the total amount that you were supposed to get before.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will see the markings on the pills are going to be different,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the AGV indication will also be on the label, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way you'll definitely know that's different and you got a different pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do I do with the ones I got?\n\nSpeaker 1: If they're not working, toss them.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to save them for a rainy day, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Drains don't lead to the ocean or anything, so you can flush them if you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Completely up to you, Mr. Fanto.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're yours.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are still generic Viagra, like I said, very similar to what guys get from the VA.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they are yours.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to send them back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to send the AGVs, and there's going to be no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: I already placed in that order for you for no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see that come out in the next three to five days,\n\nSpeaker 2: probably this early upcoming Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your help, Kevin.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye now.",
