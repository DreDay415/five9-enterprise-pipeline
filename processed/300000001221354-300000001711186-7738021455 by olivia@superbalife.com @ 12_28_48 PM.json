    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Thyatra, this is Olivia, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good afternoon, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Craig Mosley, I'm returning a call from the message you left me yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I left you a message, okay, yeah, I'll try to remember, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I\n\nSpeaker 1: called him today, left him a voicemail, that he should get his refund soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was processed a week ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and the thing is, when we spoke before, well, I, what was it, Christy, I believe was\n\nSpeaker 1: the other associate that called, well, messaged me through email and was stating that I was\n\nSpeaker 2: still due for a refill in July, and I didn't want any more refills at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was hoping that my prescription would have been canceled with the call that, when we\n\nSpeaker 2: spoke last week, I don't know, I sent it to the website, and it's not giving me an option\n\nSpeaker 1: to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so if you, like, of course you do have the option to cancel the script in its entirety,\n\nSpeaker 1: you just wouldn't be able to order with it again, and we do have a policy where we only\n\nSpeaker 2: pay for the doctor's visit one time, so if you wanted to place it on hold the full six\n\nSpeaker 1: month period, which is until, you know, July 28th, and then if you did still have pills\n\nSpeaker 2: in late July, you could let us know, hey, leave my script on hold, I still have pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: or, you know, in June, you run out, you say, hey, I need some more, you would at least\n\nSpeaker 2: have that option, versus if you do cancel the script in its entirety, you wouldn't have\n\nSpeaker 1: that option, and you would have to start from the beginning and pay the doctor's fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can understand that, it's not a problem, I just didn't reach, it didn't meet my expectations,\n\nSpeaker 1: it didn't really do anything out of the norm for me when I used it, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see, so it doesn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a different conversation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, then that makes sense that you don't need this script.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is my job to let you know that if the pills don't work for you, you do have the option\n\nSpeaker 1: that it looks like you haven't tried our newest product.\n\nSpeaker 2: If the pills don't work for you, you do qualify for a free sample of our newest product that\n\nSpeaker 1: we think would work for you, that it looks like you haven't tried.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff we've ever made, but my favorite thing\n\nSpeaker 1: about it is that, you know, obviously besides being FDA approved and third party tested\n\nSpeaker 2: and coming from Pfizer in France, we've also specifically formulated it to cut out the\n\nSpeaker 1: side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way the free sample would work is obviously you don't need this prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: because the pills don't work for you, so it would be replaced, so, you know, canceled\n\nSpeaker 2: out and replaced with this new one of the 10 pills that are the free samples and it\n\nSpeaker 1: would be placed on hold for you until June while you try it out, make sure you love it,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you prefer it to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe that you would and we believe that in that window of time, like five months,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd give us a call back, you'd order some, we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If not and they didn't work, that's fine, you just need to let us know by June, but\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd at least get to try our newest product, which is a superior prescription to your current\n\nSpeaker 1: one and we think that it would work for you if you were interested.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any time somebody says free, what's the catch to it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the catch is what I just explained, it's that it does begin a new script for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but that script is placed on hold until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if you love the pills, it takes care of itself, right, because you'll use the 10\n\nSpeaker 2: pills within the next few months and then you'll call us to order some and that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they didn't, you just have to let us know by June, but that really is the only catch.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no shipping fee, there's no, like I'm the one who charges you and what I type\n\nSpeaker 1: in is 0.0001 so that your checking account doesn't even register the charge and it's,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, it would be 10 pills of 100 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yeah, you'd probably receive them by like next Wednesday or Thursday and you'd have\n\nSpeaker 2: until June to try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, I don't feel that I really have anything to lose.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give them a try and if it doesn't work for me and you need the remainder returned,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be open to doing that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so this is 100 milligrams, 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ship these to 9138 South Springfield Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, 60805?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it'll be Evergreen Park, but it is a part of Chicago.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my home address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but it'll go to the right place, like the last one went to the right place, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it did.\n\nSpeaker 2: It did reach me a few days after we talked and then I returned it the same day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah, so I just sent that out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that should be out to you in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yeah, if you need anything before June, just give us a call at this number,\n\nSpeaker 1: Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here, even sometimes on holidays, it depends.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, I hope you love these.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you take them on an empty stomach, that's really important,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them,\n\nSpeaker 2: you should notice considerable results with them, and I hope you do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to try, and as we discussed, if it's something that's working,\n\nSpeaker 2: then I'll go ahead and order, and if not, then I'll definitely let you know way ahead of time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks so much, Greg.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, bye.",
