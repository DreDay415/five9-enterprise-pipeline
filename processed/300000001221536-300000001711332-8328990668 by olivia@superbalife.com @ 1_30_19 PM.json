    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking\n\nSpeaker 2: with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alfred Gonzalez, G-O-N-Z-A-L-E-Z.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Mr. Gonzalez. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. I'm glad to hear it. How can I help you today, Mr. Gonzalez?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I just got an order of score blue, and I didn't order extra or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need it, really. If you have my list there on the subscription, if it can be canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I can help you look into this. Okay. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 4-12-57.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. And you're located at 8311 Katie Hockley Road, Katie, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah. So I do see your prescription here. If you don't want to receive regular\n\nSpeaker 2: refills with the prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option\n\nSpeaker 1: to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months\n\nSpeaker 2: is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it. And the way that would\n\nSpeaker 1: work is if you did want to place it on hold today, I'd be happy to do that for you. And\n\nSpeaker 2: if you did need to order anything before the end of July, you could. You just have to give\n\nSpeaker 1: us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. No, I want to completely cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, not really.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Okay. Well, yeah, just so you know, the final part of\n\nSpeaker 2: my job is to let you know that if the pills don't work for you, it looks like you do qualify\n\nSpeaker 1: for a free sample of our newest, highest quality products, because it looks like you\n\nSpeaker 2: haven't tried it before. It comes from our Pfizer labs in France, and it is the fastest\n\nSpeaker 1: acting, longest lasting stuff we've ever made. But my favorite thing about it is that we've\n\nSpeaker 2: specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you did want to try it, the way it would work is the 10 free pills, they would\n\nSpeaker 2: start this new prescription that would be placed on hold for you. So you'd get a five\n\nSpeaker 1: month, kind of like a five month free trial, where you'd have until June to try them out,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you love them, make sure you performed your old script. We believe you would, and\n\nSpeaker 1: we believe that during that period of time, you'd use them all, you'd give us a call back\n\nSpeaker 2: to order some, and then we might be able to keep you. And if not, you just have until\n\nSpeaker 1: June either way to let us know. But they are a great product, and they would be a free\n\nSpeaker 2: sample, and it looks like you haven't tried them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what are they called?\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra, H-E-V.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they're still Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're still Viagra, but it's a little bit more, I guess, more researched, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and it's newer, and then it should work for everyone within, usually within 30 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: For some people, it can work as fast as, you know, 11 minutes. But yeah, like I mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 1: favorite part is that we've been able to cut out the side effects that seem to affect\n\nSpeaker 2: some people. Maybe they didn't affect you, like headache, but sometimes they've affected\n\nSpeaker 1: other people. So yeah, it's a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, with this product here, I mean, I don't use it a lot, but it doesn't do nothing for\n\nSpeaker 1: me at all. I don't get no side effects or nothing on this product here that I got. And\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got the second bottle, and my first order, I still have plenty of it. And that's\n\nSpeaker 1: why I said I don't need no more, really.\n\nSpeaker 2: And on a new product, what is that going to do? Is that going to replace these bottles,\n\nSpeaker 1: or I'll just take a loss?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the tin pills, yeah, essentially. And I mean, if you liked them, I think that'd\n\nSpeaker 1: be fine. And then if not, you know, you would have other options.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no, just go ahead and cancel it. Cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, you always know where to find us in the future, and we'd love to have you\n\nSpeaker 2: back, especially to try that product. We just wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample\n\nSpeaker 1: at a later date, just because it's a current promo that you've denied. But I hope you have\n\nSpeaker 2: a great day out with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.",
