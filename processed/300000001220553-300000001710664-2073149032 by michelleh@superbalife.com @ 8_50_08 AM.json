I'm hot today. How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, hon. Good. I got an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's, like, a handful, like, five states where your state law for the telehealth medicine,\n\nSpeaker 1: it requires that the doctor has to verify your identity.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let's see. They sent you a link. They sent you a link to upload a video.\n\nSpeaker 1: All you have to do is say your name and date of birth.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't want to do that, I can assign it to a doctor and have them give you a call to verify your identity.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That'd be fine. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'll do that. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, hon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's annoying.

Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, do you have spam call blocks on your phone?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if I have a block. No, I think I get them. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I don't know if he's going to be calling on an unknown number, no caller ID, or he might call with a...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. That's fine. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. He has to just answer the weird calls for the next few hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I marked it expedited, so you'll be at the top of his list.\n\nSpeaker 2: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Captain Kirk.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sweetheart. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a good day. Talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too, dear. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
