Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, good afternoon. I'm calling. Yeah, but Ollie, I ordered a product from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the 12th. It was shipped to me on the 14th. I received it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried it then I called you guys back and told you I was unhappy with it and—\n\nSpeaker 2: The young man on the other hand said, oh, you know what, we shipped out the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it kind of irritated me because, you know—\n\nSpeaker 2: I paid for a product that I didn't receive and then you tell me you shipped out... I'll make a long story short.\n\nSpeaker 1: He talked about he was going to refund me and they canceled my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I waited and then that was on the 19th.\n\nSpeaker 1: I talked to you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then only I called back on the 21st because I didn't see—\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything in my email or anything on my credit card account that you guys have—\n\nSpeaker 2: Refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm waiting. I waited. Now today is the 28th and I still don't see the refund that you guys promised me—\n\nSpeaker 2: At this present time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, it takes five to ten business days to be safe usually.\n\nSpeaker 1: To see the refund reflected, but you got refunded—\n\nSpeaker 2: 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said he was going to send something to me—\n\nSpeaker 2: Ollie, by email stating that that was—that that had taken place and all my emails, nothing is no reference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me get your reference. Let me get somebody to send you an email here real quick. Okay, as we speak.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you mind getting that email tomorrow? I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Have no problem getting it whenever I—\n\nSpeaker 1: This is—\n\nSpeaker 2: Ongoing. It's just been an ongoing problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if I should call the Better Business Bureau, or what should I do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because this is the third time—\n\nSpeaker 1: That I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's—that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, that's what you guys are telling me, but all I asked when I called on the 21st—\n\nSpeaker 2: I simply—I simply said, okay, I agree with you, send me something.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said I'll have it by the time I hang up the phone. Well, here today is the 28th, seven days later—\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll eat. I don't have anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's not reflecting on my card.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that was the 21st and you telling me it should be on my card within five days, five days from 24.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but when I get—when I get a credit on my—on any other thing—\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't take that long, and I was just wondering why your company is taking so long.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, honestly, that's not a question I could answer, to be honest with you, Mr. Jackson. What I'm gonna—\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, tomorrow you're gonna receive—\n\nSpeaker 1: You're gonna be tomorrow—\n\nSpeaker 2: Tomorrow? What about today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me—guys don't close, you guys don't close till five o'clock.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I should be able to get somebody on the phone today that can tell me—\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent you a receipt showing that you got—you have been credited. That's all I'm asking for, okay? Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see if I have somebody—\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one moment. I'm gonna place you on a brief hold, okay? Thank you, sir.",
