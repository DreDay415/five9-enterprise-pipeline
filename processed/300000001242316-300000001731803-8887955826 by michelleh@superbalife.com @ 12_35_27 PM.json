    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I ordered from you once.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm probably a month ago or something and I just received another shipment that I didn't order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm hoping I'm not on some automatic refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me check. Can I have your phone number so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 2: 8 1 7 7 9 3 8 6 6 1.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Patrick. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: April 22nd, 1954. Thank you so much. You see your VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it looks like the doctor put you on refills on a monthly basis, which you are not required to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything's good, but I certainly don't need—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, on a monthly basis, not a problem. So with your VIP status, what a lot of people like to do—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could pause that for you until August 1st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'll go on that. I just hope that I remember because I'll be inundated with pills if I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you're all set. You're paused until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set. You're paused until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So in terms of this shipment, I'm paying for it. I got it. So I'm paying for it. Yeah, $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, if you don't need it—\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just put on the package \"return to sender,\" pop it back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way they can issue you a refill once they get that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. All right, so but all right, I—I'll eat the $63.95 or I'll send it back but—\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to happen again. Uh, I'm going to have to make sure I call back by August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, to uh, either renew it or whatever. Okay. Yeah. Okay, perfect. All right, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right. Have a great weekend, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle, thank you, Michelle. No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye. Bye.",
