I just ordered today, the first order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Am I supposed to wait for some type of teleconference doctor's visit, or is it going to automatically be sent out?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they're going to evaluate your medical survey, the medical information you provided to the questioner,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going to write a prescription, because it gives an overall idea of your health,\n\nSpeaker 2: so they know if it's safe for you to take Viagra or not, and they'll write the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can already tell you that I think everything was good, because I see the doctor already wrote the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: so the pharmacy has it, so it's going to take two to five business days to get to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Robert Estrella on Redland, California, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you are approved by the doctor, so you probably have your health in general pretty okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: so they wrote the prescription already, so two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep in mind, we have the weekend, so maybe sometime next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, got it. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I just want to know, I don't know if I was making a teleconference call, but okay, I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. You've been very helpful, sir. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good day. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.",
