    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. My name is Mr. Akers, and I went to your website,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they told me to call this site. What I want to do is...\n\nSpeaker 1: I see what's going on. Carol, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. 11-6-48. 1948.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like they sent you just regular generic, not the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I've seen where... I don't want to continue this,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I already have what you all offer, and it's at least as good, if not better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the medication on you, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because they sent you just regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did not receive the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I want to do is I'm going to send you out a replacement free of charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do that,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I've read that people have done this, and they get the same thing again.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't even want to do this. I just want to stop it all,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I'm already getting that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to go around, and I don't want to have to be canceling cards\n\nSpeaker 1: and all that stuff, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, no, yeah, no. No, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because I was going to say I could send you out the replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I can tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then what we could do is pause your refills for six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I can give you my direct extension, so you can call me back,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then that way you don't have to sit on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you can call me back and let me know if it works out for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if it doesn't, you can go ahead and cancel from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: But at least that way you get your replacement of the correct medication\n\nSpeaker 1: that you paid for in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I could switch it to 100 milligrams as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it's worth it. You paid for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Might as well get your replacement, and then you just call me after you get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, I've read where at least three or four people have done this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they get the same thing again, and that alone started to make me mad.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would just get me angry.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that would piss me off if I got the wrong thing a second time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So okay, so I'll tell you the difference before you agree to get the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: So your bottle right now, it says APCO on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the name of the generic manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on your pills, the letters AC is imprinted,\n\nSpeaker 1: followed by the numbers, like, 340 or 390.\n\nSpeaker 2: And on the HB...\n\nSpeaker 1: As a matter of fact, hold on. I've got the bottle here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, good. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Honestly, sometimes it happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing evaluations, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: What it is, y'all, even like I said, I'm evaluating.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at different things.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to have to go pretty far to beat this R-U-G-B-I-E-T, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to have to go real far to beat that, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That melts on your tongue in 15 seconds.\n\nSpeaker 2: In 15 minutes, you're ready to go, you know what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is not that, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't even come close to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing with those companies is they're not FDA-approved,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you've just got to be careful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I don't care about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I don't care about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've gotten already, and I'm not satisfied with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now what do you want to know on this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tell me what's imprinted on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's what?\n\nSpeaker 2: What number, like what is imprinted on the individual pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, this little diamond-shaped pill on this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it say AC?\n\nSpeaker 2: 339, yeah, AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, those are just generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're just toss-o's in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then that bottle says APCO on the label.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the generic manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So sometimes the pharmacy runs out because they're in such high demand,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then they send generics, and they don't tell us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that creates a bunch of problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can send you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: How about I send you out the replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm going to switch it to 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'll pause you for six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'll give you my direct extension so you can call me back\n\nSpeaker 1: personally, and then, you know, if they don't work,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can cancel you out from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're going to pause me for six months though, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'll pause you until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds fair.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let me do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, switch them to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, like I have somebody on my personal call list right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just better because that way you don't have to sit on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, and then you're already frustrated,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you call in and you're on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's more frustrating, so screw that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I put that in, and then do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it takes time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, my extension is 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 00, it's the same number.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the extension, 0020, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'll sure give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean, you might as well try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You paid for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sound wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how can I, when can I expect this?\n\nSpeaker 1: They'll be shipping it out to you either today or tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: It ships from Kentucky, so you'll get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pharmacy will email you a tracking number, or you can just call me, too,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can track it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
