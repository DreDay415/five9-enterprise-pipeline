    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Lydia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's Kalman Lourdes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Kalman, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good, how you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I seen your ad online on Facebook,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I ordered, I wanted to just order one bottle\n\nSpeaker 1: to try and see if it worked.\n\nSpeaker 2: There was no results with the 10 pills you sent me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the other day another bottle showed up.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need to cancel that order\n\nSpeaker 1: so that it quits showing up at my house\n\nSpeaker 2: because it's not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay Kalman, you have a great name.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, 11-10-65.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 13186 South 5800 West\n\nSpeaker 2: Harriman, Utah?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so if the pills don't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: I am sorry to hear that, but that does make sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just so you know, you do qualify\n\nSpeaker 1: if you were interested.\n\nSpeaker 2: If the pills don't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: for those who haven't yet tried it,\n\nSpeaker 2: we are offering a free sample\n\nSpeaker 1: of our newest, highest quality Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: but my favorite thing about it is\n\nSpeaker 1: that we specifically formulated it\n\nSpeaker 2: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way it would work is the free sample\n\nSpeaker 2: would be 10 pills, and it would come with\n\nSpeaker 1: kind of like a free five month trial\n\nSpeaker 2: where you would have until June to try them out,\n\nSpeaker 1: just the 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'd send them to you one time, they're free.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you'd have until June to try them out,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you love them,\n\nSpeaker 1: make sure you prefer them to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we believe that in the next two to five months,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd give us a call to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I do this one trial,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's all I'm gonna get is the one bottle of 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: There won't be another one coming the next month?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, but the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: all of it would be placed on hold until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you would just need to let us know by June,\n\nSpeaker 1: either whenever you're ready to order\n\nSpeaker 2: and how you want the script set up,\n\nSpeaker 1: or if the pills didn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is unlikely but possible,\n\nSpeaker 1: you just need to let us know by June.\n\nSpeaker 2: So one way or the other.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so how are they different from the ones I ordered?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because those were like a fast-acting, more powerful one.\n\nSpeaker 1: They were the white diamond ones, not the blue ones?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are these different ones?\n\nSpeaker 2: They are.\n\nSpeaker 1: These ones come from their Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they are faster-acting and longer-lasting,\n\nSpeaker 1: but like I mentioned, my favorite thing is\n\nSpeaker 2: they don't include the side effects\n\nSpeaker 1: that maybe don't affect you, or maybe they do,\n\nSpeaker 2: but do affect some people.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was gonna say, I did have headaches and stuff, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the problem I had is they didn't really work at all,\n\nSpeaker 1: really, so that's what concerns me\n\nSpeaker 2: with trying something different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it gonna work, or is it just another pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bob?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're asking me if it's just gonna work.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean exactly?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I still couldn't basically get and hold an erection\n\nSpeaker 1: with these pills that we're taking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are these pills different to the point\n\nSpeaker 1: where they will help more potent, more better?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, and they are definitely a higher-quality product.\n\nSpeaker 1: And because they are newer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they have been developed in the Pfizer labs in France,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, France has higher regulations,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is really nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, I mean, they're great products.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's no charge to me to try those other 10 pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I have six months to get back to you\n\nSpeaker 1: to tell you whether to keep them coming,\n\nSpeaker 2: or they didn't work again, or...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm willing to try another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send them out to you at 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to be 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ship these to 13186 South, 5800 West,\n\nSpeaker 1: Harriman, Utah, 84096?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, you should receive these by the end of the week,\n\nSpeaker 2: or, you know, that winter storm is crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So maybe Monday or Tuesday is the very latest.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, if you need anything before June,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're always at this phone number,\n\nSpeaker 2: Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then a really important moving part.\n\nSpeaker 1: You may already know this, but it's worth reminding.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to take the pills on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, ideally, you want to avoid alcohol and caffeine\n\nSpeaker 1: the day you take them, just because caffeine and alcohol\n\nSpeaker 2: restrict blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't drink alcohol.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I only drink one Pepsi a day, really.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that shouldn't be too hard.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I love to hear it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Kalman.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you love these, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
