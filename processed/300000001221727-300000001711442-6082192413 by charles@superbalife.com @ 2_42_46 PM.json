Say I was enrolled before, but I had changed credit card numbers, so now I\n\nSpeaker 1: got a new credit card and I'd like to get back in line. Sure, okay, you're in\n\nSpeaker 2: McFarland, Wisconsin, right? Yes, but I have a new address.\n\nSpeaker 1: New address, thanks for that. Okay, so it's no longer 2444 County Road AB, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the new,\n\nSpeaker 2: you want the new one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes sir, I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: 7304 Cottage Grove Road, Madison,\n\nSpeaker 1: Wisconsin, 53718. Cottage Grove is one word or two words?\n\nSpeaker 2: Two words.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two words, thank you. Okay, Cottage Grove, I'm gonna start from the beginning, 7304 Cottage\n\nSpeaker 2: Grove Road, Madison, Wisconsin, 73718, or 53718, excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Okay,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you said we have a new debit or credit card and you were getting the\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra AGV, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Okay. That's a hundred milligram, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hundred milligrams, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm ready for the new card whenever you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4306-9410-0035-3357. Expiration? 5 of 28. And security code? 080.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm gonna place that order right now, okay? What do you figure, 3-4 days a week?\n\nSpeaker 2: Honestly, brother, with the weather and everything that's happening right now, it's very hard to determine.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're in Wisconsin, so I'm not too sure how it is over there right now with the snow,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the snow's a factor for a lot of places right now, so be patient with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. I'd say maybe Wednesday or Thursday next week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes sir, hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care, bye-bye.",
