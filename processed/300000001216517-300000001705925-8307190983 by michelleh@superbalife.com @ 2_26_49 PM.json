    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. I'd like to cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought I had already canceled it, but I just got another one in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me help you out. Give me one second. I'm pulling up your profile.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see what's going on. Okay, Johnny, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-25-53.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. This is your VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I see the doctor put you on refills on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not. That's why I'm canceling it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that's why I was asking. Do you happen to have the medication on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you take out an individual pill and tell me what's imprinted on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Say AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: AC?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it does.\n\nSpeaker 2: AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. Okay. So the pharmacy made an error and just sent you regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes that happens when they run out and they don't tell us, and that creates problems.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second. I'm going to get you out of replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not interested, ma'am. I don't want it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just cancel it altogether?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send me a confirmation e-mail, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll have the e-mail team send you one over.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's johnny.castro at bracket ISD.net.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine. That's one of them, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Not a problem. I'll do that now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
