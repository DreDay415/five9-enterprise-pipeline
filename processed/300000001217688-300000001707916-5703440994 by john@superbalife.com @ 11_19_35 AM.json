I can check.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. 1-A-5-0-4.\n\nSpeaker 1: Watson Street in Scranton?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do you happen to be a junior or a senior by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Did you recently move to that address?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your date of birth is February 22nd, 1960?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: For some reason, it didn't recognize you in the system.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to put it through.

Yeah, I'm like, no, I've lived here for 25 years.\n\nSpeaker 1: The most common things are those three things I mentioned.\n\nSpeaker 2: If somebody's a junior or a senior, it'll trip it up if they recently moved or the date of birth,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it could just be something else because your name's common.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know, but it's all good. It'll get approved and shipped out this week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And what is the total of that for, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: You got 40 of the 50 milligrams, and that's $163.95 is what you paid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay. All right. I just want to make sure, and I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, John. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
