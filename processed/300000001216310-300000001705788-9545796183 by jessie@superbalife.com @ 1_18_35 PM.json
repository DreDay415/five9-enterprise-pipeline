    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael. My last name is E-T-G-N-A-T-Z.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. All right. Is it EGGNOT?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 33026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Ooh, you got another refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know. I just came. I didn't know I was on a continuous refill, but more importantly, I got a medical event, so I had to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gotcha. Okay. I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me do this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if the pills were working out for you. I mean, you do have a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could do this for you just to keep your prescription active, but not get anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can switch this to an as-needed basis and pause it for six months for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You won't get charged anything. You won't get anything in the mail, none of that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can order whenever you feel like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But to keep your prescription active, you only get one refill of 10 pills at the end of six months if you don't order anything, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay? All right. I did that for you, and you're all set. Okay? Hope everything turns out okay for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Take care now. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.",
