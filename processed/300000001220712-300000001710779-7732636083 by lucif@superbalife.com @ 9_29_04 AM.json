I'd like to cancel my monthly delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow, really? You want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me pull up your account so I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what is your zip code, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 60641.\n\nSpeaker 2: 60641. Amazing. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is your name Eduardo?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you, Eduardo. Oh, I do have you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see you're a VIP customer as well, getting Villagro.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you mind if I ask why it is you're canceling?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't want it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you like kind of getting it too fast?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you know you can always order this as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to get it the way you are currently.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't. Again, I forgot I even had monthly whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'd rather just cancel that automatic withdrawal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you don't have to get it automatically, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically, we can just keep the prescription available for you\n\nSpeaker 1: for like a six-month period,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you can call in and order your next orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I want to do is no longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll set that up for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it won't be delivered or charged, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, until you call in,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we are going to keep your prescription available to you\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can call in for your next one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anything else you need, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I am going to do that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can also give you an extension as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because you can even call me and place your orders,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can make sure it stays this way for you also.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what is that?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N,\n\nSpeaker 2: and my extension is going to be 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're welcome.",
