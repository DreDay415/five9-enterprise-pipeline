    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my name is Gerald Lewis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Gerald. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing okay. Yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Gerald?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to cancel my subscription with you. You just sent me the second order, and that's all I need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. Okay. So what is your date of birth, Gerald?\n\nSpeaker 2: January 13, 51.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're located at 350 Kelly Drive, Fayetteville, Georgia?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And this refill from today, you do want to receive it. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Has it already gone out?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know what? I've already paid for it, and it's a hassle to refund. So let's keep that one going, but no more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Just so you know, you do always have the option with your prescription if you don't want to receive regular refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is if you did want to place it on hold until the end of July and you didn't need anything before then,\n\nSpeaker 1: you could have it. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. I'm not sure I understood the last part. I can put it on hold for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: What happens at the end of six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So July 27th, it would be a Monday. So that the prescription didn't expire, it would be refilled.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you would just need to let us know by then. Either, hey, I'm out of pills. I'm ready to order again, which would reset everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or, hey, I still have a few pills. Can you just leave me on hold another, like, three months, four months, whatever you need.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You know, but also I imagine that if I just say, cancel it, forget it, because six months down the road,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know where I'll be, what I want to do, and I don't even know if I'll remember.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I just cancel it now, I can always log on and say, hey, I don't want a prescription, but I just want one order sent to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: So we do only pay for the doctor's fee one time. And because we do offer the option to place the prescription on hold,\n\nSpeaker 1: we don't offer one-time orders that don't come with a prescription, that doesn't come with at least one refill saved every six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: that can always be adjusted in the following month, but has to have at least one saved that far ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what? Let's just cancel it. I mean, the one you just took payment for, I used PayPal, as you can probably see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's that one go through, because trying to get a refill from PayPal is just not worth the hassle. But no more, okay? Let's cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: They work, but I don't need them that often, and I'm not going to remember what to do in six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I might not want them to come again in six months, so I'd rather just cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, the last part of my job is to let you know, and if you're interested, great. If not, no worries,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that if the pills weren't working for you, you do technically qualify for a free sample of our newest, highest-quality product,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is a superior prescription to your current one. It is the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes directly from our Pfizer labs in France, so it is FDA-approved, third-party tested, all that good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is that we specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the free sample would be 10 pills, and the way it would work, if you were interested in trying them,\n\nSpeaker 2: is I'd send them out to you today. You'd probably get them in the next three to five business days,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you would have until July to try them out, make sure you love them, run out of them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, based off of the results and the data, and that you'd give us a call at some point within that duration of time to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we might be able to keep you. And if not, and they didn't work for you for any reason, you just have to let us know before July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Before what? Before the first of July? So let you know sometime in June? Is that what you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So yeah, the way you would think about it is this prescription would be canceled under the premise that the pills don't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the new one that would be started would be started with a free sample of 10 pills, and it would be placed on hold for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Until July, while you try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said the free sample is going to be sent out when?\n\nSpeaker 1: Today. It would get a little tricky because the other order which you would be receiving, you'd probably receive them both around the same time.\n\nSpeaker 2: You might receive your regular order one day before, but our newer product, the difference would be your current prescription, that product on the pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: it says something like AC340, whereas the product I would be sending you on the pills, they would say 100 for 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I'm going to send these out to you at 100 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I mentioned, it's going to be 10 pills. Can I ship these to 350 Kelly Drive, Fayetteville, Georgia, 30214?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. That's the right place. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Great. So those will be out to you in three to five business days. I hope you love them. I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then like I mentioned, if you need anything before July, we're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just let us know. And oh, also, please take these on an empty stomach. That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. Thank you so much, Gerald.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you're welcome. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
