Just need your name and zip code, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: The name is E, the initial E,\n\nSpeaker 1: J,\n\nSpeaker 2: Bowler, B-O-W-L-E-R. I placed your order last Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think the 27th was, you see, no, not the 27th. What date was that?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be, I'll be able to see. Can I get your zip code too, EJ?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's 4-H-3-9-3.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I actually remember, I set you up, I remember now because of the NED. I remember talking to you. So, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what I'm guessing, sir, is a snowstorm has delayed this getting to you. It has gotten to Michigan. It's gotten to Pontiac.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to refund you for the express shipping because it obviously took longer, but it is still on its way to you, it says.\n\nSpeaker 2: And where is it currently? The last check-in was in Pontiac, Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Was it sent by the post office or by\n\nSpeaker 2: GPS or something? Post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Post office. So, it should be here tomorrow, then, I would guess, right? I would expect it to be there shortly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, like I said, I think it's because of the storms. It's just slowing it down.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, it should be to you within a day or two. It says in transit to the next facility arriving late.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it is still on its way. So, I refunded you the $15 on the express shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, appreciate that. Of course, sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it is still on its way. If it doesn't arrive by the end of the week, call us back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your name? My name is John.\n\nSpeaker 2: John, okay. Thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, sir. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
