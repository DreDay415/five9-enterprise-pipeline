    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would like to talk to you about a reorder. I've got your stuff already, so I'm all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Up with that. The thing about it is, you sent me 50s, and you're charging me like 5-something,\n\nSpeaker 2: 580 or something. You need to do better than that. I mean, at my store, I can get just\n\nSpeaker 1: regular Viagra at the CVS for like 85 cents a pill with the Good X prescription thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: What can you do? I like your pill better, I think, than Viagra, but I'm not willing\n\nSpeaker 1: to pay you 3 times, 4 times, 5 times as much. So, what can you do with the 100-milligram?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, James Campbell and 11-10-47.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you, James. So, yes, for the ages, if we do have 3 different packages available,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can either order 10 pills for $49, 25 pills for $99, or 40 pills for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's no deal. I mean, they're still the same price. It's within 10 cents.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're actually way more. So, usually a quantity of 40 is over $300. A quantity of 25 is over\n\nSpeaker 2: $163, and a quantity of 10 is $100. But right now, you can go ahead and get 10 pills for $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, can you do this and make it for 100-milligram and not 50s?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, we can definitely update it to 100-milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because a 50, I can cut the 100s in half and get double the mileage, and that way I can get your price down to 250.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's what a lot of customers do. They'll get the 100-milligrams and cut the pill in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if you want 100-milligrams, I can definitely get you 100-milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what quantities would you like? The 10 pills for $49, the 25 pills for $99, or the 40 pills for $149?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's about the same, I think, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: But you'll be getting it in a different quantity because you'll be cutting the pill in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying that between the 50 and the 100 and 150, it's pretty much the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no price difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: The price is the same. The dosage just depends on the preference of the customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, go ahead and do the $100 one. What is that, 20 of them?\n\nSpeaker 1: 25 pills for $99.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so 25 pills, 100 milligrams. And then, James, is your shipping address still the same, 5560 East El Sendero Drive?\n\nSpeaker 2: El Sendero, yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Arizona 85331, perfect. And I do see here that we do have an Amex card ending in 3005.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I go ahead and process that card, or would you be using a different card?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you can use the same card. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Same card, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. You're all set, James. I was able to successfully place in that order for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Have a good day.",
