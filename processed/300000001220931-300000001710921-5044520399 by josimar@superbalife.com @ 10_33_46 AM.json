    "text": "Speaker 1: Viagra, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I made an order yesterday, and I just got a question.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just one time...\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code and your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Zip code 70033.\n\nSpeaker 1: Steve Puniecki, P-U-N-E-K-Y.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. So I pulled you up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do see your first order is still at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So one quick thing I wanted to mention.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if you were able to read the terms and conditions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you get a chance to look at that by any chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I have, but go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries. Just to confirm with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ideally, every order needs to have a prescription refill date to become active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Without that, they won't be able to ship the first order out.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't mean you need to receive the first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it doesn't mean you need to receive the refill order.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just means it needs to have a refill date to remain active.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I could do for your case, though, so that way they can ship this order out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see the doctor sets you for every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could switch you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm trying to tell you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't have to yell.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to one time. I want to try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want a monthly deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: By any chance, were you able to listen to what I just said, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I did give you a whole explanation on what I'm trying to explain to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just said that every order to be shipped out needs a refill date.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if you don't receive the second order, it needs to have a refill date to be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you so that way the doctor just doesn't send one one month out from now,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to freeze it out for six months from now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not saying you need to get that order in six months from now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All I'm saying is that's how this first order will be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: See if you're a fan or if you don't like them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just call us back.\n\nSpeaker 2: From that point on, you can just make the final decision on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it needs to have a refill date to ship.\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you able to understand that by any chance, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sort of, but I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Basically what I'm trying to tell you is for the order to ship out,\n\nSpeaker 2: it needs to have a next order date.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't mean that the second order will be sent to you or you need to accept it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can decline it whenever and delete it whenever,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you need to have a next order date so that the first order can ship the initial order\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's how the prescriptions to Pfizer's work.\n\nSpeaker 1: In this case, I already see the doctor has you put down for a refill of every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where we're at right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Instead of you getting it every month,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to let it happen because you don't want it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm delaying the orders half a year from now to give you time to receive the first one,\n\nSpeaker 2: try it out, and if you're a fan of it, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call us back and change the frequency to your preference.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're not a fan, call us back and then the prescription will be deleted entirely\n\nSpeaker 1: and you won't be able to access it anymore, but then that means you won't receive it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you kind of getting me now?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will change it out for you for six months so you get an opportunity to actually try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because, I mean, I just take it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I would never take a pill a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have sex every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: We understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so give me that six-month delay or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'll do that for you so that way your first order can ship and you can try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you receive it, just try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let us know you like it right after and then we can make the final choice there and then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got to try it out, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I definitely understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I set that up for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're already set on that part, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: If any questions come up, just let us know, but you're all separate today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and it's made at the Pfizer factory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, these are made in Pfizer, France.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're distributed through our pharmacy here in the U.S., which is Kentucky Go-Go Meds.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are located in Los Angeles, though, but the pharmacy is in Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I look forward to trying it, but I'll get back to you on the refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're more than happy to help you on that part, but just give it a go and then call us back to make your final choice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you got me a six-month delay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: For now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Six months from now, it looks like it'll be in July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
