    "text": "Speaker 1: I talked a little earlier about returning a prescription because I didn't finish the—\n\nSpeaker 2: whole order and they didn't send what they said they were going to send, then they put—\n\nSpeaker 1: me on a recurring refill, and I got a second one I never even ordered, and then she had—\n\nSpeaker 2: me look at the pill and said, well, they sent you the wrong one anyway, and so that's why—\n\nSpeaker 1: I probably didn't finish off the order, I decided to cancel, and then she hung up on—\n\nSpeaker 2: me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what information are you looking for, Nick?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you just looking to see how to return it, or what do we need?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, A, let's start with the fact that she told me they sent me the wrong pill to begin—\n\nSpeaker 1: with.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they want me to go down and spend $9 or $10 a week to send back pills that after—\n\nSpeaker 1: you give them, you can't do anything with them, you've got to throw them away because—\n\nSpeaker 2: you can't return a prescription medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you could, especially with these ones because they're not, I forget the term, they're—\n\nSpeaker 2: not classified as something, controlled medication or something like that, they're not classified—\n\nSpeaker 1: as that.\n\nSpeaker 2: With your situation, if you're interested, Nick, I mean, you can keep those and I can—\n\nSpeaker 1: send you replacements if that's something that you're interested in, and I can make—\n\nSpeaker 2: sure that we send the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything is canceled, I'm just letting you know what your options are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you still have the original packaging?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then they want me to send the pills back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, why should I?\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent the wrong stuff anyway, why should I have to pay to send the stuff back anyway?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why should it be upon me to do it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, if I have to call my bank and just reverse the charges, I will, but I'm trying—\n\nSpeaker 1: to avoid that.\n\nSpeaker 2: They can't just credit my, or not credit, but reverse the charges on my debit card?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, unfortunately, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that's our policy, we do need the pills back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it really is not going to take that much money to send it back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Understandably so, it does cost a couple bucks, but to get the money back, we do need—\n\nSpeaker 1: the pills back, unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even though they sent me the wrong stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so that's where I was saying, look, I can message the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: We obviously want to make sure that you have a pleasant experience with us, all right—\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, sorry about the first call, but, I mean, if you want, I can send you replacements—\n\nSpeaker 1: for each batch that you got of the AGV, especially if you're still looking for something to give—\n\nSpeaker 2: you that kick, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can message the pharmacy right now and tell them to send you over 25 free pills to replace—\n\nSpeaker 2: the ones that you currently have.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you have what you paid for, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'll just go the other route.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just call my bank and have them reverse the charges on the credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's ridiculous, I didn't even finish out the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I asked the girl, why'd they send me a refill?\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor thought that you would probably want a refill, so they sent it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the prescription, when it gets written up, it does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to clarify that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, that's a standard practice for any medical industry, especially telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pills should be doing their thing, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure if you've even tried the pills to begin with, but all of our pills are FDA—\n\nSpeaker 1: approved, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not fighting that point.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't care if they're FDA approved or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: We were just messing around.\n\nSpeaker 1: We tried to try them, and then we said, no, we'll just cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Didn't even finish the order out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then three, four weeks later, I get pills in the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought, well, what the hell?\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to try to mess around with getting a refund from my bank.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I just let it go.\n\nSpeaker 2: This time, I didn't ask for the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: They sent the wrong pills to begin with.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, how's it on me to have to, I mean, you should just be able to reverse the—\n\nSpeaker 1: charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not asking for the first one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have those pills, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All I want you to do is be first or second to the refill that I never asked for.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not that hard of a deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm messaging everybody I can right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need a minute, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're doing what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm messaging people I need a message for this, so just give me a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I got green light, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to also deactivate the account as well, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here's what I want you to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't care about the first one.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was my mistake.\n\nSpeaker 1: I should have figured out a way to cancel better than what I did by just—\n\nSpeaker 2: closing the site down.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want some refund on the $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just did right now, so you should be getting that within the next three to—\n\nSpeaker 1: five business days, not including the weekend, and that will be that, all—\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, do you see my point where they sent the wrong pills anyway?\n\nSpeaker 1: Look, I hear you already.\n\nSpeaker 2: I already heard that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, no disrespect, but I already said I can replace every single pill—\n\nSpeaker 2: but we've already taken it this far.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've refunded everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's as far as I can go.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can send you confirmation of the refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great rest of your day, okay, Nick?\n\nSpeaker 1: Where are you located at?\n\nSpeaker 2: Los Angeles, California.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not getting the snow and stuff on the east side?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's nice and sunny right now, actually, and a little chilly, but nothing too—\n\nSpeaker 2: crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: We live in Iowa, and we didn't get any snow.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have any cold weather.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure the rain season is coming pretty soon, though, so make sure you—\n\nSpeaker 1: guys stay dry, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Send me an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'll send one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, take care.",
