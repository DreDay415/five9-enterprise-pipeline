    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd like to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me see if I can pull you up and see if I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure I can. Bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I have someone to speak to, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Fred Heidman.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Heidman. Okay. I was able to pull up your information here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you're currently getting the Viagra 50-milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you're getting 10 of them, your prescription, every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any particular reason why you want to cancel today, Mr. Heidman?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't mind me asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just have a bunch of extra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just don't need that many.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'd like to do for you so you can keep your prescription active,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can postpone it and pause it so you're not getting them every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, therefore, you can keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what that does, that allows you to, when you get caught up,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can actually order when you want and still keep the discounted price that\n\nSpeaker 1: you have because you know our pills do come from the Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when the tests kick in, they're going to go up like three times as much.\n\nSpeaker 1: But by you having an active prescription on file,\n\nSpeaker 2: you will keep that same grandfathered in price.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can, like, postpone it for like six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, therefore, when you want to order, you can always order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if six months happen to come too quick for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can always call like you're doing now and push it back a few more months\n\nSpeaker 1: so that it keeps your prescription active,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you won't get them as regularly as every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So can I go ahead and do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: So a question with that is do I have to call to activate it\n\nSpeaker 1: or does it activate itself again after?\n\nSpeaker 2: It stays active, so that means you can call any time in between then.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I will actually give you a date too as well where you can call before that\n\nSpeaker 2: date and say, hey, I'm not ready for them yet, push them back some more.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you won't get them every month going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm setting you up on a six-month plan so that gives you more control to whenever\n\nSpeaker 1: you want to order in between those six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And that will keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: My question is in order to receive more in the future, do I have to make a call\n\nSpeaker 2: or does it start automatically after a certain – after a set date?\n\nSpeaker 1: On July 28th, if we haven't heard from you, you will get ten additional pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it will be paused again for another six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it will be every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm setting you up now so your prescription will be active.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have a date of July 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's six months from now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we can give that a try.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just took care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, again, that allows you to order in between that time,\n\nSpeaker 1: or if you want to pause it later, you can always call us\n\nSpeaker 2: and say push me back a few more months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have some left because the pills have a shelf life of three years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
