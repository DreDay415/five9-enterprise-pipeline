    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra, Escort Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to know why y'all took $40 and something few cents out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. So yeah, we can take a look at the prescription and see how this is organized.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bear with me while I pull up your account, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Could I please get your full name and date of birth, please, under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Scott Matthews, 12.7 of 1974.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 1: You there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Sorry, I'm just looking at the details from the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was classifying it. I didn't hear nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know. I can be quiet sometimes. Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. So I see here the initial prescription was written in November.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was for the 100 mg Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that sound accurate? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like what the doctor did is it wrote it with refills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: She wrote it with refills every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is not required or obligated.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have seen cases in this where with the lower quantities they'll do this for patient convenience,\n\nSpeaker 1: but obviously it comes to surprise if you didn't see it in their notes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Scott, this is not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not required to get this every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted, you could pause the prescription where you won't receive these monthly,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather do that than have a surprise like this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure. I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go ahead and put that pause on there for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be paused until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, Scott, yeah, if you want an order before that, just make sure you give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've got an order coming in right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, you do.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is scheduled right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like it's set to be delivered middle of next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
