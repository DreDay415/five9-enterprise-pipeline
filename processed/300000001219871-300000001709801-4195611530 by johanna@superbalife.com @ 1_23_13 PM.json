    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I need to end my refill subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can assist you with that. Can I get your name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ronald Baker, 32263.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you. I have your account here, and I do see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted you to know, sir, that you are not required to get your refills on a monthly recurring basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are not a subscription. We are a telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that prescription written by the doctor was made available to you with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as our customer, you can decide how you want to set up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can modify the frequency and quantity at any time or put a pause on your account for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Was there a reason for the cancellation today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need this much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that makes sense. And that's exactly why we're so flexible with our customers about frequency and orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, we understand that life circumstances change, and, you know, people have different needs.\n\nSpeaker 1: So currently it's set up to receive a refill every month, but I can remove that and set it up for every three months,\n\nSpeaker 2: every four months, every five months, every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to get out of the refills period.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again, what I can do is I can put a hold on it until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way if you want to call in and place an order before then, you'll still have access to your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, if I cancel it entirely, it will cancel that prescription available to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you want to place a future order, we won't be able to fulfill that order without a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Put me on hold until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excellent. I'll go ahead and place it on a hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not going to receive any refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just let us know if you want to place an order before then or if you want to extend that hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, sir, for being a VIP status customer. Have a beautiful day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
