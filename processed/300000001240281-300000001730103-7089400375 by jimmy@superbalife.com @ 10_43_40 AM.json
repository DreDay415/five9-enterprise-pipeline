It looks like it was scheduled to come out to you every month, so we can pause that out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long do you want to pause it for?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, maybe September, maybe.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see, as far as I can give you, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll see what I can do for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got more than enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: The order came in today, I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so look, the farthest I can do is six months, but you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: If six months come too soon, you can always do what you're doing now and just call us and push it back some more.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the date I have is August the 6th.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you call before August, you know, just call us before August and push it back a few more months, that's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll be good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just took care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So remember, the beginning of August, and if you need it, but the good thing is, if you need it before then,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can always call and order before then with no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
