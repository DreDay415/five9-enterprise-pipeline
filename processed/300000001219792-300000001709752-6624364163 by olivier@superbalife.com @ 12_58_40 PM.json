You're in what, Mississippi?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, Mississippi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I think, I'm guessing, because your state requires a short five-second video. I don't know if you're able to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or we can have a doctor calling you. It's either or. Yeah, you're one of those states.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is 12 states who require, you know, have specific rules for...\n\nSpeaker 2: Please give me a message.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so Mr. Johnson?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so your state, a long couple of them require five-second video.
