Please stay on the line.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Mike Sutton.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael, this is Charles. We're just on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need you to write down another address and send the tester gene to a different address, not the Beverly Hills one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me know when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just one second, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's okay. Fire away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It is 1171.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then just write the letter S for South.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then Robertson. Robert and then son. One word. Robertson Boulevard.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then put the number sign 525. Number 525 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the zip code is 90035.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're going to make it out to H&S Fulfillment.\n\nSpeaker 2: H&S Fulfillment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. Yeah, that's who we ship it out from.\n\nSpeaker 2: So 1171 South Robertson Boulevard, number 525, Los Angeles, California, 90035.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just one second, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that's the address on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I just wanted to double check.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to triple check just so that there's no mishaps or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So as long as it gets back to them, you should be good to go, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to double check again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's the address of Douglas, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, perfect. Okay. So sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to be 100% positive, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me make this up. I got this five by five.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the testosterone, those two bottles go in that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I put this at the Sildenafil?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I put that in the same package or is that a different package?\n\nSpeaker 2: Negative. Yeah, that's going to be a different package.\n\nSpeaker 1: So testosterone goes to Los Angeles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sildenafil, Viagra goes to Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You actually feel better yourself?\n\nSpeaker 2: Negative, no. Just a little mattered.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think this might be down that road too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Back in 1963, I was a poor kid and I had 60 days after high school.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I went to my uncles and I said, where should I go?\n\nSpeaker 2: One of them said Special Forces.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, can I do that? He said, shit, you'll do it just fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't easy, but I did come home alive.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your call back, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. I hope you have a great one, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
