    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My first name is Robert Latham Moreno.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, and Mr. Moreno, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: The zip code's 91770.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, are you at 2728 Falling Leaf Avenue\n\nSpeaker 2: in Rosemead, California?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and were you calling about the subscription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so when I initially signed up,\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to try to see how it would work,\n\nSpeaker 1: if it worked or whatnot,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it didn't work as I thought it was gonna work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then I thought that it would be something like,\n\nSpeaker 2: where I would be able to,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was just a one-time thing,\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't think I was gonna continue to get recharged.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got charged on the 20th.\n\nSpeaker 2: I definitely didn't approve that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I got hit with another $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need to cancel the subscription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I don't know if I'm gonna be able\n\nSpeaker 2: to get my money back for that or not,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if not, then I still need to just cancel\n\nSpeaker 2: that subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just have a quick question for you, though,\n\nSpeaker 1: because we never get complaints on these bills.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't mind, can I just take a,\n\nSpeaker 1: it sounds like you have the pills there with you,\n\nSpeaker 2: is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I have the first set that I got the first time,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I only used one of those,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I have the second one that just came.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, out of that first batch, if you don't mind,\n\nSpeaker 1: can you take out one of the pills\n\nSpeaker 2: and tell me what the stamp on the pill is?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it'll be smooth on one side, and then on the other side?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what, unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to do it\n\nSpeaker 1: since I'm at work, and those are at my house.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, oh, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then let me take a look and see if I can pull that up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason I ask is because, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: don't get complaints on this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm concerned about whether or not you,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you ordered it online.\n\nSpeaker 2: One second, I'm not gonna take up much of your time\n\nSpeaker 1: because you're at work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know what, I was gonna tell you\n\nSpeaker 1: what was a little, that sounds a little weird,\n\nSpeaker 2: was when I received the first batch,\n\nSpeaker 1: it came from a different pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the second one came from another different pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're both different pharmacies.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if that has anything to do with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know one of them came from Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 2: the other one, I don't know where the other one came from.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they all come out of Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: They have to come out of Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't work with any other pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think they sent you the American version,\n\nSpeaker 2: one, not the French.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's what I will do because, well, first off,\n\nSpeaker 2: let me go ahead and make sure\n\nSpeaker 1: that you're not getting charged for anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna turn off that subscription\n\nSpeaker 1: and change this over to as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason I'm going to do that\n\nSpeaker 1: and keep your prescription active,\n\nSpeaker 2: different prescription active,\n\nSpeaker 1: is because I'd like to send you the French ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: The French ones are the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm looking at this here,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it looks like you were sent the American ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to send you the French ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I noticed that right off the bat when I looked at it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't say, it was a white pill as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't say that on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the bottle should say AGV on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the pharmaceutical should be listed as Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yours showed that it was listed as Abco.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Greenstone is a subsidiary of Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here's what I'm gonna do.\n\nSpeaker 2: This recent one that you received,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to replace that one with 10 pills of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you love the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: let me know I'm going to replace your first batch as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've paused everything for six months\n\nSpeaker 2: to give you enough time to try the pills\n\nSpeaker 1: and see how you feel about them.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's more than enough time.\n\nSpeaker 1: But once you try them once or twice,\n\nSpeaker 2: let us know right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, because these are the ones that are,\n\nSpeaker 2: quite frankly, I get a lot of return calls on these\n\nSpeaker 1: because they're really good.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, people see the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm just gonna go ahead and replace those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that okay with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, the thing is,\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I understand if I'm not gonna get the money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatever it is, what it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm gonna be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to continue the service\n\nSpeaker 1: and find out that I'm gonna be charged again\n\nSpeaker 2: in six months later or whatnot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd rather just stop it so that I don't have to have this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't wanna have to make a call again.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, earlier, just trying to get ahold of you guys\n\nSpeaker 2: was so hard to figure out where you guys were.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me do this for you then, at least.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can give you my name and my extension\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't have to wait online for like forever.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can just talk to a direct individual.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you an email at robswoodworking79 at yahoo.com\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can keep that handy with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you do like the pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: because at least if you're going to say no to something,\n\nSpeaker 2: at least say no to something that you know\n\nSpeaker 1: really isn't a fit for you\n\nSpeaker 2: because the ones that are from France\n\nSpeaker 1: really do work exceptionally well.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we would like them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the only other reason I would obviously tell you no\n\nSpeaker 1: is because I just found out that from my actual doctor\n\nSpeaker 2: that I had over here where I go to,\n\nSpeaker 1: they already prescribed Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is only $3 from my insurance.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what does that make?\n\nSpeaker 1: $60, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, then that's a bigger difference there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me go ahead and stop that for you\n\nSpeaker 2: so that way you don't get anything else\n\nSpeaker 1: if you're trying Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only other thing I was gonna say\n\nSpeaker 1: is if you still want me to pause the prescription for you\n\nSpeaker 2: in case Cialis doesn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can also do that as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because again, the AGV is not the same as what you receive.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV is different.\n\nSpeaker 2: This one is the new pill from France.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the event that Cialis doesn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're welcome to try the AGV\n\nSpeaker 1: if you would like me to keep that prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what I'll do is, again,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would rather continue to stop this prescription cancel\n\nSpeaker 2: because I'm not charged at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if it's something,\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, if you could extend those ones\n\nSpeaker 1: that were supposed to be sent in the first place\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll try those.\n\nSpeaker 1: And at a sub-major time if they come in,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I feel that it will work,\n\nSpeaker 1: then I'll go ahead and give you guys a call\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't wanna be put on a six-month hold\n\nSpeaker 2: or more do I wanna be put on a one-year hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanna just kinda cancel it\n\nSpeaker 2: and then allow myself to make that decision\n\nSpeaker 1: if I wanted to go back again and try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, I can't send it out\n\nSpeaker 1: unless the prescription is active.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, then if you wanna cancel it altogether,\n\nSpeaker 1: then we'll just do that then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I can send it out\n\nSpeaker 1: if the prescription remains active\n\nSpeaker 2: and you have that amount of time to let us know\n\nSpeaker 1: if it's a yay or a nay for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can just cancel it then, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's been canceled and you won't be charged anything, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And now is there anything I can receive via email\n\nSpeaker 2: showing that that has been done\n\nSpeaker 1: so that I have that as, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll receive an email shortly.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the last question I have\n\nSpeaker 1: is with regards to what was sent.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first batch, obviously, I understand that's mine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I paid for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that second one, how does that work?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a reason for that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or how does that work?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because again, that was not something\n\nSpeaker 2: that I was authorized to do when it was done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, you can return that one for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send you an email\n\nSpeaker 1: with return instructions for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, bye-bye.",
