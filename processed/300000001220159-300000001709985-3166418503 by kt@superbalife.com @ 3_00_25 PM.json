I really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got back myself. How can I be of service, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, two things. Number one, you had me circle that\n\nSpeaker 2: and return it to sender. The tracking number now does show that it's coming back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me look at it. Yeah, it's refused.\n\nSpeaker 2: We see that. Let me, because I promised you that\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's already coming back, let me put you on a brief hold. I'm sorry to keep putting you on hold, but that way\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get you the credit that you deserve, alright, like I promised.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we have everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we have everything. And I did verify it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me just put you on brief hold and I'll walk over to the admin team and the accounting and have them release the funds.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, bud? Just bear with me.",
