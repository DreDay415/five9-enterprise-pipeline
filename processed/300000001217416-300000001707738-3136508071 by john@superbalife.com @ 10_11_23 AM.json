    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Marvin. I've seen your ad on the AVG pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I want to try the 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can get you set up on the phone if that's what you're looking to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do you have an email address, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's my full name, Marvin, crossing C-R-O-S-S-O-N, at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. What's your date of birth, Marvin?\n\nSpeaker 2: 14, I'm going to say 2-14-51.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-8-2-0-6.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Next part is a brief medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because this is a prescription, we've just got to give our doctor some background information on you for him to be able to write the prescription out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once we finish this, I'll place your order for the 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long have you been concerned?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not the 25 pill. It's the 25, what's it, milligrams or whatever?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, oh, oh, 25 milligrams. Fine, yeah, no problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, we have a 25 pill pack as well, but, yeah, I can do the 25 milligram. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I've had prostate cancer just some years ago, and they put me on Viagra and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It worked at first, and then it stopped working years later.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't want to get stuck with some pills that's not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to try this thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you. That makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for clarifying.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let's get started here on the survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long have you been concerned about or wanted to improve the hardness and duration of your erections?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's been years. It's been years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Besides the, when you took the Viagra before, besides, like, the diminishing returns on it working,\n\nSpeaker 2: were there side effects or was it all fine except for it just stopped kind of working how you wanted it to?\n\nSpeaker 1: I stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was mainly, it was quite a bit of side effects, you know, backache, you know, headache and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they lowered the dosage down to, I think, 10 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can't remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been some years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: When was the last time you had a physical?\n\nSpeaker 2: Less than a year, less than three years, between three and five, or more than five?\n\nSpeaker 1: Less than a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything was good?\n\nSpeaker 1: No abnormalities?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again, I just have, I can't even think right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't even think.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so the next question here, is your blood pressure normal, elevated, high, very high, or abnormally low?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just normal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Diabetic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Diabetic, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you take any prescriptions, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, just for my diabetes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you take metformin?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the only thing you take for the diabetes, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Other than that, you know, just, you know, I take the metformin twice a day, and then I take a pill for nighttime.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a certain pill I take for bedtime, and that's about it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have any allergies that you know of, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm not allergic to anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the past few months, have you passed out, had dizziness, seizures, or chest pains?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, two questions left.\n\nSpeaker 2: This one's also probably no.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the last few months, have you used any of the following recreationally?\n\nSpeaker 2: Crystal meth, marijuana, poppers, heroin, molly, or cocaine?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I never did none of that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last one is a list of different medical conditions.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've already kind of touched on some of these, so, but I'll read through the rest, and if you hear one you have, stop me and tell me, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hyperlipidemia, vascular disease, emotional problems, hormone problems, kidney disease, neurological problems, trauma or injury to your penis, pelvis, perineum, testes, and rectum, urinary problems, sleep apnea, chronic fatigue or weakness, retinitis pigmentosa, a significant bend in your penis, pain with an erection, problems ejaculating not related to hardness.\n\nSpeaker 1: With your prostate cancer, sir, did they do radiation at all, or did they just remove the prostate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did they remove just a portion?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I had my prostate removed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: As far as all the other stuff, no, I don't have none of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, like I said, as far as the erection, I don't even, you know, I get erections in my sleep.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to note about the prostate here for the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Only a few left.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unexplained weight loss, joint pain, sexually transmitted disease, heart disease, or urological surgeries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Note all those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, on the 25 milligram pill, sir, did you want to do 10 pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the minimum order we have.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll get you set with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your address, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1654.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hazelwood.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Detroit, Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's 48206, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you're ready, sir, I can take your card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you said at the zip code, you got 48206?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You ready?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 5491700049824170.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration 1130.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 810.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your order went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: This will go through the approval process.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then once you're approved, we will mail this out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it mails directly to your home, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let us know how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: We do like to get feedback on first-time triers of the AGV, but I think you should be pretty happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have talked to other people like yourself that had their prostate removed, and this works out well for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, hopefully, it's the same for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Truthfully, I'm not going to be too, you know, happy because I've taken the Cialis and some of the other stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I guess since my surgery, it hasn't been pleasant, and it just got worse over the years.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, hopefully, this changes things for you, but do let us know one way or the other.\n\nSpeaker 1: But otherwise, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: This should ship out within a couple days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Marvin.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.",
