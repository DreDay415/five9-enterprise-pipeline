    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling, this is John, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tell me about this thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what would you like to know, pricing or about the product itself?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it said the first time is three, the price, whatever it is, just tell me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay sir, you don't have to be angry at me, I just asked a question.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm very sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all good, I'm going to tell you everything you want to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the product itself is a Viagra made by Pfizer, it's AGV stands for authorized generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It means they're making their own generic, basically they're trying to get both sides\n\nSpeaker 1: of the market, so the brand name and the generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what it means for you as a person who would take it is it's made at a higher quality\n\nSpeaker 1: level to a higher standard, so it works more effectively overall on each use.\n\nSpeaker 2: The medication is dispersed into your bloodstream more efficiently and better just overall,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it'll work faster and longer for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's all FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then regarding pricing, it's 40 pills at $149, 25 pills at $99, and 10 pills at\n\nSpeaker 2: $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm 85 years old, I haven't had sex in 20 years, but I met somebody else, I met\n\nSpeaker 2: somebody else and they're supposed to be coming to stay with me and I want to see if I can\n\nSpeaker 1: make a change, you know, 20 years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you want to get signed up, we can do it on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like a lot of people, like you call in and they're hoping or like trying to change something\n\nSpeaker 2: or try again.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want to get started, we're happy to help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I thought they said they think for certain people to try it out, it was free and that's\n\nSpeaker 1: what I called it, but I don't mind, don't get me wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't mind paying for it, but I'd like to be able to try it, but I don't know why\n\nSpeaker 1: I could walk around here for 14 hours with that thing on hard.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, well, so it wouldn't be hard the whole\n\nSpeaker 1: 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just means that like it'll still last in your system in case you need it to work, but\n\nSpeaker 1: yeah, no, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be impossible.\n\nSpeaker 1: But regarding the – I don't know anything about the free thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing I've seen on the ads that are free is like if you buy 30 pills, we throw\n\nSpeaker 1: in the extra 10 as a free compliment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Part of this service is you have to get a doctor's approval.\n\nSpeaker 1: We pay for that as part of the service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, when you buy the pills, so that's\n\nSpeaker 2: why you have to pay first.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have to go to my doctor and get him\n\nSpeaker 2: to write a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: We write the prescription on our side.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have doctors that work as part of our – like our system at the company here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're licensed in all the states we operate in, and then there's a health questionnaire\n\nSpeaker 1: we would fill out on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they would look at all that and just make sure there's nothing there that's going to\n\nSpeaker 1: be a problem for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All I ask is you're not pulling my leg.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's my age it will work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, I've talked to people older than you\n\nSpeaker 2: that are reordering this because it's working well for them, and I'm not pulling your leg.\n\nSpeaker 1: I promise you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know you said you're 85.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've talked to people in their 90s that are buying from us, and it works for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it doesn't work for you, we have a full money back guarantee.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a 90-day window after you receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you would know within the first couple times of trying it if it's going to work for\n\nSpeaker 1: you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you were not happy, we could get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can think of it like a risk-free trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do have to pay up front, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you hear me, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I lost you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought you went to the bathroom or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can hear me now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But Jimmy, what's the minimum I can get right now to start with?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, are you there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me call you back.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got my number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me back.",
