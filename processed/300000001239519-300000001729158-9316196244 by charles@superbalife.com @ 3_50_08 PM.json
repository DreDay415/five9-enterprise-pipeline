I had prostate cancer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm trying out different things to see what I can do about getting the injections.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyhow, I'm just looking because I've got a knee problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I see that you're trying to get $63.95, I think.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So Ricketts in Jacksonville, Florida?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so your prescription, when it gets written up, it does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you just not need this one just yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no. I'm actually – no, I won't have the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: The other thing is I thought I had signed a part in your agreement\n\nSpeaker 2: where if you didn't want it, you filled a certain part out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And all I was trying to do was to test it out to see if it works\n\nSpeaker 2: because I've tried quite a few.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only thing that seems to work are the injections.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I've tried Blue. I've tried – what's that new one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Regulin? Anyway, a new one that just came out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And no, they don't appear to work right.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only reason is that I'm living in Jacksonville\n\nSpeaker 1: and my cancer hospital is in Tennessee, Vanderbilt.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. So I'll refund this one. I'll make sure it's canceled as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just good luck in the future then, brother. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate you. What was your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles. Oh. Like the king. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like the king.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good one. All right. Bye-bye.",
