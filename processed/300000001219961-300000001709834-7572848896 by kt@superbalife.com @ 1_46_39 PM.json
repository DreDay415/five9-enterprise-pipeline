    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Ted? Yes. Please take down my extension so you could deal with me directly. I have\n\nSpeaker 2: my fingerprints on this and as a veteran I take a lot of pride in my work bud and I've\n\nSpeaker 1: helped a lot of people in your case and I'm the best at this and I because I've studied\n\nSpeaker 2: physiology, anatomy, kinesiology, nutrition and they put me in the right position to be\n\nSpeaker 1: able to do this and I'm speaking from experience too. Not at your level because every situation\n\nSpeaker 2: is very unique but we've got to keep in mind everything that you've been through and everything\n\nSpeaker 1: that you need, okay? It has to be right. I'm also considered, I'm a disabled vet so I retired.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your service bud. Yeah, thank you. I retired in 2000 and yeah, I got the\n\nSpeaker 1: PTSD and all that other crap so. Yeah, I got it too. So hey brother, you know if you ever\n\nSpeaker 2: read the book, I use somatic therapy a lot. It's based on the book. It's called The Body\n\nSpeaker 1: Keeps the Score. Like I vowed at 18 Bravo not even to use any guns anymore and only\n\nSpeaker 2: to use my hands because if I even see a gun, it's either fight or flight. You know what\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean? So, you know how it is. Oh, I look at it as one of us isn't coming out alive.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you bet your ass, boy. You bet that ass, dude. So, right on, Sarge. So, here you go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's my extension. My extension is 0037. 0037. Think of a secret fire agent and my name is my\n\nSpeaker 2: initials, Kilo Tango. KT, Kilo Tango. Last name is Goodrich, Ted. Goodrich as in golf,\n\nSpeaker 1: Oscar, Oscar, Delta, Romeo, India, Charlie, Hotel. Goodrich. Alright, so Goodrich. So,\n\nSpeaker 2: this is what I did, Sarge. The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly\n\nSpeaker 1: refills. The second thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments and\n\nSpeaker 2: the third thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I paused your\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription and I elevated to elite because you are a veteran which gives you access to\n\nSpeaker 2: order at your command. But based on what we've talked about, I'm going to send you\n\nSpeaker 1: right now, right, and correct me if I'm wrong, just AGV, 100 milligrams. I'm sending you\n\nSpeaker 2: 20 of them to replace what you have in your hand. It's not to say that stuff in your hand\n\nSpeaker 1: is bad. It just doesn't work for men like you and I. We've seen some crap. We've been\n\nSpeaker 2: through some crap and we need this stuff to work, you know. One thing we have in our life,\n\nSpeaker 1: I always tell these doctors, I said, damn you guys, you could take my house, you could\n\nSpeaker 2: take my car, but don't take my, you could take my dog, just don't take my guns, my lady\n\nSpeaker 1: and my vitality. So, you know, I don't give a damn. So, I'm going to send you 20 pills\n\nSpeaker 2: to 402 Ensign Court, right, in Hempstead, North Carolina. I'm sending you, get it by\n\nSpeaker 1: Friday at best, Monday at worst. My extension, of course, as you know, is the 0037. Keep\n\nSpeaker 2: in touch with me. When you get your batches, call me because I'm going to guide you through\n\nSpeaker 1: taking the activator. The herbal, organic, FDA approved activator is two in the morning,\n\nSpeaker 2: two at night. We're going to flush you out, bud. And once we, have we known that all these\n\nSpeaker 1: MREs would have destroyed our gut health, not to mention maybe the alcohol and all that\n\nSpeaker 2: during R&R, you know, just to curb the pain. We wouldn't have filled the, it's all about\n\nSpeaker 1: absorption, bud. So, with the AGV, the way it disperse, so it goes smoothly down your\n\nSpeaker 2: esophagus. It drops to the bottom of your gut like a bowling ball and it disperse like\n\nSpeaker 1: a grenade and it shoots a web to the inner wall lining of your membrane. Then your gut\n\nSpeaker 2: membrane sends a message to your hippocampus and bing, a light goes on, you get this twinkle\n\nSpeaker 1: in the eye like you're ready, you're ready to bite down or you just like, you know, like\n\nSpeaker 2: get to see, get that twinkle. And then your brain tells your arc of the aorta or your\n\nSpeaker 1: heart to send 70% of blood to your, your schlong, your Johnson. And the only adverse side\n\nSpeaker 2: effects is one, like I said, she's going to want to marry you again. And two, you might\n\nSpeaker 1: want to switch from the regular Trojans to the, to the big magnums, bud. Like actually\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to be firing off a M1 Howitzer 110.\n\nSpeaker 1: We know that there's no medicine that makes things bigger.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, I know. I know, I know. But, you know, I just want to tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's more than one thing, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, but I just say the 110 Howitzer, bud. Talk about blow your, blow your house\n\nSpeaker 1: down, but we'll make this right. So I got those out to you. And then another thing is\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to know is call me right next week when you get them. And then in light\n\nSpeaker 1: of all this, when you get a chance, when we get off the phone, go to scoreblue.com. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I need you to do, bud, is log in, Ted, with your hotmail. Okay. And when you log\n\nSpeaker 1: in with your hotmail, you're going to go to a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: In light of all this, when we cross the next bridge and you give me the green light,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to see a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you can either call me or click that button to get a refill anytime, anywhere,\n\nSpeaker 1: any place. All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Yeah, because I was going to say, I was either going to just say, okay, let's\n\nSpeaker 1: just see how this is, because sex doesn't happen often. Okay. And because she, she don't\n\nSpeaker 2: really care for it now. And, you know, so we're like, well, if I can't please her, what\n\nSpeaker 1: the hell? So I was on my last pitch effort. I was just going to say, hell with it anymore\n\nSpeaker 2: and try the booster, something like that. So I was going to try something else.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we're throwing you a hell, Mary. This thing is beautiful. It's powerful. It's clean.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's FDA approved. Okay. Safety and security. We have already done a lot of terrible and\n\nSpeaker 1: we've seen a lot of crap. Let's keep it nice, safe and clean, man. Because you're, you're,\n\nSpeaker 2: without you, life will be very, very difficult for your bride. You know that. So you got\n\nSpeaker 1: to stick around for us, Ted. All right, bud? Yeah. Well, I think it may have already cost\n\nSpeaker 2: me one divorce. I don't want to go through it again. Yeah, I know how that is, bud. And\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, we married our profession, but we married, we were married to the military.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now we got to stick to our brides, you know, and just satisfy them all the days of\n\nSpeaker 1: our life. You know what I mean? And it says it in the Bible, bud. So, so try this out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll love it. Yeah. Well, hey, do me, if there's any consolation to you, bud, if you,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you're pretty good at an email, just email support at scoreblue.com. Support at scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just let them know what your experience was like on this call. I'm up for review and,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, anything can help, you know, merit, merit and honor over money. But, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: but little money don't hurt too, you know, if I get a good review, but yeah, write them\n\nSpeaker 1: an email. No, I appreciate you. You know, this is how we roll, bud. You know, we do\n\nSpeaker 2: things right. And, you know, we, we pledge allegiance to our flag and to our people and\n\nSpeaker 1: we're going to do it. We'll keep doing it in any way we can. It doesn't matter what\n\nSpeaker 2: arena or what, what platform we have. All right, bud. Right. I got it. All right. Support\n\nSpeaker 1: at scoreblue.com. Be on the lookout, Ted, for this stuff. And then I'll be on the lookout\n\nSpeaker 2: for that good review. You know, let me know, bud. Let's see if this stuff, this next stuff\n\nSpeaker 1: works because I mean, I'm at my last leg with any of this. I'm almost ready to give it all\n\nSpeaker 2: up. Yeah, but keep your chin up, bud. Like, keep your chin up. You know, you're not dead.\n\nSpeaker 1: So God's not done with you yet. And you gotta stick around, bud. You know, keep that chin\n\nSpeaker 2: up. I was supposed to, you know, they say I was supposed to die, but I didn't make,\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't quite fulfill their needs. You can't die, Ted. You can't die, Ted. You're, you're\n\nSpeaker 2: bulletproof and you're cancer proof. I canceled that in the name of Jesus, bud. You know that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that. I survived hostile territories and I survived the cancer. I figured somebody,\n\nSpeaker 2: somebody's up there looking after me. Yeah, you bet. As you know, there's no atheists\n\nSpeaker 1: in foxholes, you know, so. No, that's right. I don't, I don't care what God you believe\n\nSpeaker 2: in, but I'll tell you what, you'll find God real quick. And you know what? You're going\n\nSpeaker 1: to say, Oh, I'm atheist. But actually, you know, you see the guy private Ryan praying\n\nSpeaker 2: and all that. But thank you, sir, for your service, Ted. Yeah, you bet. Support at scoreblue.com\n\nSpeaker 1: KT Goodrich and always here to help you, bud. And stay, stay close to me. We'll make it\n\nSpeaker 2: out of there. We'll make it out fun with smiles and you know, we'll have fun doing this. All\n\nSpeaker 1: right. We're not here for a long time. We're here for a good time. All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it. Thank you, KT. You bet. Oh, you bet. Adios, bud. Thank you. Bye bye.",
