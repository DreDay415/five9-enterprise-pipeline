    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, this is K.T. Didrikson with Pfizer-Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't see who's calling because you got transferred from our pharmacy, but\n\nSpeaker 1: can you share your telephone number, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll look up your account so I can help you put a stop to this, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all good, my friend. My number is 207-608-9385.\n\nSpeaker 2: I love your accent and I love your style, George.\n\nSpeaker 1: How you doing, George?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm old.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm good. Actually, I'm good. I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, but you know what they say, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a classic saying I'm learning because I'm with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm about nine years behind you, but we're getting old.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going downhill, but we're gaining speed, Mr. Landry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm still in great shape.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just don't have the stamina I used to have. That's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries, George.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries, bud. Let me share with you what I see and then we'll help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I do see that you're a VIP. You've been with us for quite some time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it looks like Dr. Jacob Moore set you up with a prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: for the 100-milligram generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: The white pill that we make in our—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have it in my hand. I've got it, yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay, so I do see that he ordered the pharma to send you refills on a monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to put a stop to that and you can get it whenever you want?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I haven't—I haven't received anything in a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hmm. When's the last time?\n\nSpeaker 1: Jesus. It's been—it's been a fucking maybe a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: October. October was the last one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what—how can I be of service, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I just wanted to start getting it in the mail again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me—do you want to refill this again? I'll get you a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the weather will cause some delays right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can have it out today.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no 911 right now. It's not a 911.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're right. Okay, so what I'll do is this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just correct me if I'm wrong. 100 milligrams, the generic Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. But I have a question for you if you don't mind me asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead. Go ahead. No, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I heard you guys have a new one coming out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, yeah, we do. It's a time-release one.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's comparable, but it's not better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it lasts longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Little to no side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there's a time-release that's patented.\n\nSpeaker 1: It goes—if you do it right, it'll release in about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to try that one out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it better than this one, or is it comparable?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that the right word to use?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so here's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: What we've found, and I'm on the—actually, it's called AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I used to do the generic, but if you do it right,\n\nSpeaker 1: meaning no highly processed foods, no highly processed oils,\n\nSpeaker 2: as long as you're able to take it on a light diet,\n\nSpeaker 1: like some salmon, halibut, some fruit, vegetables,\n\nSpeaker 2: it will release in about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it goes about 13 hours, give or take.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's the best stuff on planet Earth, but give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, if you don't like it, we'll always switch you back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Trying to think of my diet.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I like a steak and potatoes, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, but you know, it's all about the absorption,\n\nSpeaker 1: because the way it works is when you take the pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: it slides down your esophagus nice and smooth with no acid reflux,\n\nSpeaker 1: no regurgitation, and no heartburn.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then it drops down to the bottom of your gut,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it goes off like a grenade,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it shoots a web to your gut lining, your membrane,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then it tells your—your membrane tells your hippocampus\n\nSpeaker 2: to send a message to your heart,\n\nSpeaker 1: to send 70% from your heart down to your Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, giving you the longest, hardest erections.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I understand. It's a blood situation. I understand what you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, let's give it a whirl. Why not? It doesn't hurt.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me—yeah, it doesn't hurt.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you don't want, I'll give you my extension,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we can always switch you back, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll get you 10. Okay, this is how it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many do you want? There's 10, there's 25 or 40.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just go with 10 for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then 10 is 63—10 is 63.95, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to charge your card to 5971, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying—I have the card in my hand. I want to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I might have a new one. I have a new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's the new one? Give me four digits at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll go slow, my friend. 44.96.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 2700.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0260.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0213.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy. And month and year?\n\nSpeaker 2: Month and year is 1128.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy. And then CVD?\n\nSpeaker 2: 038.\n\nSpeaker 1: 038.\n\nSpeaker 2: 038, yep, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it'll be 10, 100 milligrams, ADV, always gets victory, and it'll be 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to hit that now. It'll be out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow, it says invalid card number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whoa, it ain't invalid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's try again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait, wait, let me do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to, wait, wait, let me just update something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's go again.\n\nSpeaker 1: So go again, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to do all the numbers again, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy that, yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 4496.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 2700.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0260.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0213.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1128.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1128, copy that.\n\nSpeaker 2: CVD?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, and it's 038.\n\nSpeaker 2: Copy that. I'm going to confirm this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a brand new card, there's no way it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Chief, if you get a chance, please keep in touch with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just think of a secret agent.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on one second, I'm going to write that down.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's affirmative.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, my friend.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll have it out today, but it won't get to you until next week sometime Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud, no 9-1-1.\n\nSpeaker 1: No 9-1-1.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bet, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what I'll do is I'll set it up for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just call me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll set it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the frequency that you're looking at?\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you like it every three months, every six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Once a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, we got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll set it up for you, bud, and try these out.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have any, if it's too strong, let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's too weak, let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in touch with me and we'll take good care of you, right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care, my friend.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but one more time.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your telephone number again?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got to re-log you in.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, 207.\n\nSpeaker 2: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 1: 608.\n\nSpeaker 2: Copy.\n\nSpeaker 1: 93.\n\nSpeaker 2: 86.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to open up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I'm questioning myself because I don't know if I can dial it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you fucking crazy shit.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: 207.\n\nSpeaker 1: 608.\n\nSpeaker 2: 93.\n\nSpeaker 1: 85.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: 85.\n\nSpeaker 1: 85, George.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't fucking dial numbers anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't dial it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still remember the one when I was a kid.\n\nSpeaker 2: I still remember my dad's number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm my own number.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fucked up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I sent you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ken is going to be go to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for calling in, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: And let us know how we could help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for trusting us with your vitality, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for helping me out.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's always a pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care, George.\n\nSpeaker 2: That could be solid.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, my friend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Be well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 1: Be well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye, Q.",
