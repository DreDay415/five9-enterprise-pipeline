    "text": "Speaker 1: If you're calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm calling regarding prescription that I was sent.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I never signed up for any renewables.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway, what I've gotten was just a regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was supposed to be getting something called AG, Viagra AG, a compound.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 3-17-52.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is your VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see the doctor had done refills on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said the medication?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can see here the pharmacy sent you just regular generics and not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out of replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm your receipt, the correct AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to also change them to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just break them in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't be shipping this out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so when you get this new bottle, the way you can confirm you received the AGV is\n\nSpeaker 2: on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will say AGV, but it will also say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted directly on the pill is going to be the number\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the FDA approved Pfizer Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now your bottles say APCO and on your pills the letters AC is imprinted\n\nSpeaker 2: followed by 390.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just go ahead and throw those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it until July 31st of 2026 because if I cancel you out now, it will\n\nSpeaker 2: cancel your profile and the pharmacy would not be able to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll give you my extension and you can call me back to let me know how the AGV works\n\nSpeaker 2: out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What about refunds?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm sending you a total of 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you bought 10 originally and then they sent you a refill for 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you 25 total, five extra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I switched them to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can break them in half if you need to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this is a GV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So on the pill, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 because I believe\n\nSpeaker 1: on your pills now it says AC 340 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And on the bottle it will say Greenstone because your bottles right now say APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the manufacturer name.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What can you see?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, and you'll receive them quick because our pharmacy is in Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll receive them in like two days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so what is the cost of volunteers?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's free of charge because they sent you the incorrect medication in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you, so you've received 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you 25, just five extra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I paused your refills until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it gives you time to try out the AGV and you can call me back and let me know\n\nSpeaker 1: how it works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't want any more pulling out of phones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I can cancel you out, but if I cancel it now, it's going to delete your profile\n\nSpeaker 1: and the pharmacy would not get your replacement order because it would just close down your\n\nSpeaker 2: account.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I paused it for six months to give you time to try it and call me back.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, numbers of returns?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, just go ahead and throw them in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what is the cost of, I mean, is that the normal cost, like $1,500?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's the same price, $63.95, but you're not paying anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm already dead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I'm sending out the correct medication and five extra for your troubles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to get the extension 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 0020, and my name's Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: No other charges are going to come out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: When should I be calling you back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a call back before July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anytime.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if I get it and try it, call you back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Dale.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll talk to you soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
