I wanted to give you a call because I'm not shying away with doing what's good and what's honorable.\n\nSpeaker 2: How you doing? You got your grannies there, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I got my grandsons with me today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't want to grind your gears or anything, but I did call because I tried to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, did I lose you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. When we spoke in November, I was just calling back to face the fires because you wanted to get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had called in and I talked to somebody other than you, and they said all I needed to do was send the original order back and that I'd get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, I see, I see. So just so you know, what I did, remember when we spoke, the doctor prescribed you the wrong batch?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I sent you a replacement pill for pill for the right batch. So you sent those back.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's okay. And then they refunded you. So you weren't able to receive that experience.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think I got refunded.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at the chart. Let me just pull you up again. So when I'm looking at your chart, if you go now to what car did you use?\n\nSpeaker 1: I am not at home right now. I can't tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I'll circle back, bud, and then we'll go enjoy life with your grannies because those are the joys and what we live for besides vitality.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I will be certain that they did refund you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now we're kind of like, now what I'll do is I'll call you back and then we can try to cross the bridge again of getting you the right stuff. Right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you wanted the right stuff. But enjoy that and I'll call you tomorrow. Right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Okay. Adios. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
