    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Jimmy, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, um...\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to do a refill, but I wanted to make sure...\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, if I'm getting the best one you guys have to offer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You mean the ATV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm getting the ATV, 25 field, 100 straight.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you're kind of going in and out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, um...\n\nSpeaker 1: I can hear you now, go ahead, what were you saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jeremy?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I understand exactly what you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you want to get a refill, but you want to make sure you get the best one we have, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And let me tell you the difference of what you're going to get.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're still going to get the 25, but it's going to have the number 100 on the back of the white-shaped diamond field.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you're going to tell the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the new and improved one that we have, and you're going to see a drastic difference with that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, on my current prescription, is that the one I have, or do I have a different one?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you have a different one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to set it up for going forward that you're going to get the one I'm going to send you out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the one I have is a diamond field.\n\nSpeaker 2: Diamond field?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: White-shaped diamond field is from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: The same field is made from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where the labs are in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: The difference is the number on the back is going to be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the latest and greatest new and improved one that just recently came out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And at the same price?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, for the same price, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry to keep asking these questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the one I got and the new one, what's the difference?\n\nSpeaker 1: The difference is the one I'm sending you is going to work faster, it's going to last longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's not going to have side effects that the other one used to have,\n\nSpeaker 1: like the dizziness that people get, the headaches, or the stomachaches.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV one I had before, it also had the 100 on it, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Was it blue or white?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was white.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't have a 100 on it, what you had.\n\nSpeaker 2: This one is going to have a 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: The one I have has a 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the actual pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead and send me up for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to get another prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of it for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because the pill just has AGV on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The old one?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you look at the pill, you're going to see that it has the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one you have doesn't have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the new, latest and greatest.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I can't have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The one that I brought off you guys, it just has AGV on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand, but you're not hearing me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sending you the best one.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have the 100 on the back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you compare it, you'll see the difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: So look at the pill when you get them, and you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright?\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just trying to see the ones that I previously purchased on you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It shows, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: I purchased it three times off.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you asked for the new and improved best one, and this is it.\n\nSpeaker 2: These always get better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're both hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're both hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just that one is new and improved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to fight.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to fight here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me make sure your order goes through real quick, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got to update my debit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a new debit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to go ahead and give me that information?\n\nSpeaker 2: $43.42.\n\nSpeaker 1: $56.25.\n\nSpeaker 2: $33.63.\n\nSpeaker 1: $11.39.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: $12.29.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the scutical?\n\nSpeaker 1: $9.48.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: $136 still?\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't hear what you said on that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are you talking to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what's the grand total now?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're at $113?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and it went through just fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is it, about five days, three days?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it just takes about five to seven days.\n\nSpeaker 2: We hope you get a lot faster than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's the turnaround.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather tell you this will take a little longer and you get it sooner\n\nSpeaker 1: rather than it telling you that it's going to take sooner and you get it longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should get it in the next, like I said, five days or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And this one's going to be good, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, this is the best that we have.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is the better ADP that's out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cool, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: So thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Randy, you have a good one there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.",
