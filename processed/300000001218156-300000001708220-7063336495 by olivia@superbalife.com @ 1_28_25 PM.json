    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Thiagra. This is Olivia speaking. It's a pleasure speaking with you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Brandon Jeffcoat.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Brandon. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. How about you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Brandon?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Brandon, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-23-1984.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 2283 Oak Grove Road,\n\nSpeaker 2: Pond Mountain, Georgia, 31822?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do see that you have a lot of bills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, just so you know, Brandon, you do always have the option with your prescription that if you don't want to receive\n\nSpeaker 2: those regular refills, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place the prescription on hold\n\nSpeaker 1: for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is if you did want to order anything before July 27th, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, just cancel it for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just went through the things not thinking about it. Yeah, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, the last part of my job in that case is to let you know that if the pills don't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do qualify for a free sample of their newest highest quality Viagra, which it looks like you haven't tried.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is the free sample is 10 pills. They come with a five-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they are the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made. But my favorite thing about them is that we've\n\nSpeaker 1: specifically formulated them to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, the way it would work is if you wanted to try them out today, I'd send you some.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd get them by the end of the week, probably by Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you'd have until June to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe that you would, and we believe that you'd give us a call by then to order some.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we might be able to keep you, and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, thank you. I really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, all righty. Well, you know where to find us. We are the only sellers of that product in the U.S. and in the world.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, just keep us in mind. We'd love to have you back to try it. You just have to pay for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample at a later date. But I hope you have a great day, Brandon.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
