    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Joanna speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Joanna, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know this was a subscription when I ordered this the first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, honestly, it doesn't even work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got another bottle of pills today I didn't even know I had ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir, let me help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you provide me with your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Vince Corbett, 11-29-1969.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you, Mr. Corbett.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you were saying that the Viagra didn't work out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You didn't get those results that you were looking for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't do anything for me, to be honest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is recommended with Viagra to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you're taking it with a full meal, that could be part of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've been doing this for a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know what I'm doing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to check on that because sometimes that is a factor.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, trust me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I completely understand, and thank you for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, no, I completely know what I'm doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, secondly, I just want to make sure you got the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have it in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you check what it says on the actual tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it looks to me like the pharmacy sent you the previous generic\n\nSpeaker 2: and not the new AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: in which case I want to send you a replacement order, obviously at no cost,\n\nSpeaker 2: of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, can you see the AGV the first time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it says it's generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like it says benefit on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, well, it does.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says AG, but it says.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, no, it says AC340.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that confirms that the pharmacy did send you the generic and not the new\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you received two orders of ten.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you a replacement order, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 2: at zero cost of 25 of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to include five more there just for the error on behalf of the\n\nSpeaker 2: pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I just want to be clear,\n\nSpeaker 2: because we have an exclusive account with Pfizer for all the Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: trademark, which means we carry the branded Viagra, the generic,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The new AGV is still going to be a white diamond-shaped tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Pildenafil still is the active ingredient in all of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: but with the new AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: they've made modifications primarily to the inactive ingredients and how it\n\nSpeaker 2: releases in your system when you take it, so the delivery mechanism system.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you take it, it's going to feel,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's going to release more directly towards the penis,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that blood flow is going to rush there and not to your head,\n\nSpeaker 2: minimizing or not completely eliminating common side effects,\n\nSpeaker 1: which people used to experience when they took the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hate to cut you short, but I'm really in a hurry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, no, I just want to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know it was a subscription, so I want to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just, if I cancel your, well, not a subscription, first of all,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I know you're in a hurry, but it's your prescription with refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I do need an active prescription to send you a replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, I can't fulfill it with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you 25 of them at no cost,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm going to put your account on a hold until end of August to allow for\n\nSpeaker 2: you to try it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can decide how you want to set up your account going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that fair?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so once I receive that,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're saying I have until the end of August until y'all will bill me again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be on a hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just to have your prescription available should you need to,\n\nSpeaker 1: should you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can call in any time and just say, hey,\n\nSpeaker 1: this didn't work for me and cancel them, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm hoping that you call back and say I loved it and I want to remain a\n\nSpeaker 1: customer, but, yes, you do have that option.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm going to, okay,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'll put in my phone to make sure I call y'all in July to cancel them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how long will it be before this new prescription comes to me at no\n\nSpeaker 1: charge?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm hoping to get it in five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really have to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
