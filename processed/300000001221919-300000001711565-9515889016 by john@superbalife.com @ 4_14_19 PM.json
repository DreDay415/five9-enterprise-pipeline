I need your zip code too, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Zip code is 92509.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I got you pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It was shipped out yesterday, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should be receiving it two to five days from yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said two to five days from yesterday?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the standard shipping with the snow that's in the middle of the country.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because this is actually being shipped from Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, obviously, it's got to get to California.\n\nSpeaker 2: It may slow it down a little bit, but typically, it's two to five days after it ships.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good night.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
