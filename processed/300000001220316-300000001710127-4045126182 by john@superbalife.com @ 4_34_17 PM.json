    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, John. This is Jeannie Johnson. My husband's right here, Greg Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 1: We were calling in regards to his recent order and just want to make sure that he's not on an auto trip.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's talk to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you for calling us back. Can I get your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-11-66.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's been having a lot of trouble in the bedroom.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're in Portageville, Missouri?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And you don't want to receive future orders, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't want to be on an auto trip.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. I'll make sure that, yeah, that's fine. So I'll make sure that's the case for you. That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And another thing, you know, like on where they're advertising this at?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're advertising this as a totally new medication. Got a different picture of it and everything on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like it says it works in 11 minutes and lasts for so long.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is the totally same pill that I got two years ago because I got the bottle and some of them in it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, sir, so if that happened, we need to fix it because we do sell both kinds.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there may have been a mix-up at the pharmacy when they filled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your current one that you got from us is the same as you've gotten before?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the pills are identical and everything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. Same numbers and everything on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it say AC-340 on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: What did you say now?\n\nSpeaker 1: AC-340. Is that what it says on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. I think it was just – yeah, the new ones are right there somewhere where you're at.\n\nSpeaker 1: The older ones are right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the ones we sent you, though, if you could grab those ones and just confirm real quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if we screwed up, I'm just going to fix it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand the ownership. I'm not talking about that part, but I do want to get you the right one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is them right here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You found those too, but here's the AC-340 one on work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't get them mixed up. You're wanting the wrong bottle. You're going to have to read this.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 2: AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so that was the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yours should have just said 100 on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the fact it doesn't say just 100 obviously confirms it's wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll get you the right one, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again, I understand the shipment stuff, but I will get you the right pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You have any idea when they're going to ship out?\n\nSpeaker 1: It should ship out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm putting it through right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to go through as a $0 transaction on your account, like your score blue account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing it that way just so you get email updates with shipping and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. All right, man. Well, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because these are exactly the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: We were expecting something totally the same because it was a totally different picture,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're supposed to do so good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I totally understand. I'm sorry about the mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know, though, they are going to still be a white diamond pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if it says 100, the chemical makeup of that pill is better and different,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it will work better.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're not happy with it, though, after you try the ones I'm resending out,\n\nSpeaker 2: call us back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, man. I certainly appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And still, either way, there's not going to be any future auto-ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. You're all set there. I'm just getting your mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: The mistake, you're fixed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Well, we sure thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
