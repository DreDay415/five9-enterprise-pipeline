    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Michael. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'd just like to cancel my order because I'm unemployed right now and got no money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I hear that. I'm so sorry. Okay. What's the phone number associated with your prescription, Michael?\n\nSpeaker 2: 618-791-2194.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2194. Okay. There you are, Michael.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1-17-1964.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So it is my job to let you know, and if you're into it, great, and if not, absolutely no worries. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do qualify, if you were interested, which wouldn't cost you anything, for a free sample of our newest, highest quality product.\n\nSpeaker 2: If your old script wasn't working for you to its highest degree, and the way that would work is it comes with a six-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I could send it out to you. It would obviously cancel out this current script of yours.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could place it on hold for you until July while you try it, make sure you love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I could also set up your new prescription so that, you know, you only have to order one or two bottles a year to keep the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's up to you. It is an incredible product, so it's the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is FDA-approved, third-party tested, all the good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you did want to try it, I could send them to you. They're completely free.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could place that script on hold for you until July, and then maybe by July, you might have a job, you might be interested in the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not, you could just give us a call and let us know by July, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, it's a free product, and you wouldn't receive any charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be placed on hold for you until July. So if you were interested, that is an option.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm afraid I'll get charged for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. So you would, in July, right, July 1st, you would be charged for the first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'd have to let us know before then if they didn't work for you and you wanted to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if they did, then that would be good, and maybe you'd want to keep the script in order more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just cancel it all for now. Yeah, I'll just cancel everything right now, and if I get in better shape, I'll call you back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. All right, Michael. Well, your script is canceled, and I hope you have a good journey getting back on your feet, and I'm sure you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate the help. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
