    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Manuel Martinez. I'd like to cancel an order, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem. Manny, give me one second to pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I've never received a product from Viagra, or whatever it's called.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: July 1st, 1965.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see your VIP status number. Okay, give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I canceled out that refill, so you'll be seeing $63.95 back on your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually it wants to take it out the same day. It usually goes back on the same day,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if it doesn't go back, it will go back five business days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, it looks like you did not receive the correct AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I already emailed people. Nobody was –\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry. You got a call in. Okay. Yeah, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out a replacement, and then I'm going to tell you\n\nSpeaker 2: how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, quantity of 30.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you didn't cancel, you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Give me one second. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. Your name, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my name is Michelle. Yeah, I'm going to give you my name and my extension as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I went ahead and canceled out that refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you'll be seeing $63.95 back on your card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I love you, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And it should go back in today. Usually when it comes out the same day,\n\nSpeaker 2: it goes back in. But if you don't see it today, it will appear five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I put in a correct order to replace your initial order and your first refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this new bottle in the mail in a few days, on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to say AGV, and it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pills, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100\n\nSpeaker 2: for the milligrams. And those are the two ways you can confirm it's AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now, your bottle says APCO, and on your pills, it says AC390 or 340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are just generics. So you can just go ahead and toss those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm going to pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause it until July 31, 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if I cancel you out now, it will cancel your profile,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pharmacy would not be able to send you that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll give you my extension, so you can call me back\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. It's 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's so easy. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know. And Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle. Thank you, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not going to receive anything for six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So you're paused until July 31.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I need a call before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: I love you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's all a win-win.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
