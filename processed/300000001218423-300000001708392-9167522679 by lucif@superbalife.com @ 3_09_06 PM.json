How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is your name Mark?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty, Mark, I do see you're a VIP member here with us. Do you mind telling me why you want to cancel your Viagra today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you're kind of getting them too fast, because you can always order this as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's needed, but you guys auto-shipped them to me and I never signed up for an auto-ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, see, that only happens if you don't set it up for the days and months you want it to come out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unless you don't choose the as-needed option, it will go up that way, but it doesn't have to be that way, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, you know, I probably don't...\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, the amount that I'm using right now, it's not even probably worth having, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so just maybe put me as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, so basically in the next about five months here, we won't bill you or send you anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have to give us a call to receive anything, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to see any charges or anything anymore, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir, and you're going to call us for your orders in the next five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have more time or if you ever want to cancel, you can always call at any moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.",
