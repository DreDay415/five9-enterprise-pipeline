    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Larry bud, yeah, please take down my extension for reference just in case you need anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: At all too, and that way you know that you can always call me or use me as reference, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0037 and my name is KT Goodrich, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I did three things for you bud, I did exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, the second thing\n\nSpeaker 2: is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills and the third thing I did is I put a stop\n\nSpeaker 1: to any and all monthly charges and I paused your prescription and I elevated you to the\n\nSpeaker 2: elite status so in the future you can just click a button and get refills on your own,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the way to do that is you go to scoreblue.com and you log in with your Yahoo, that Larry\n\nSpeaker 1: has at Yahoo.com and then when you go in there you'll see that I adjusted the quantity\n\nSpeaker 2: to ten and then I put a red button that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you can click that button any time you want and just know that this time it'll be\n\nSpeaker 2: only ten and if you have any qualms at all, it's too strong or it's not strong enough,\n\nSpeaker 1: let me know and I can always do replacements, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me at 0037-BUD and I'll take good care of you and just know that in the state of\n\nSpeaker 1: Pennsylvania, legally we're not authorized to send you more than one refill a month and\n\nSpeaker 2: then you have to make a minimum of two refills a year or 20 pills a year in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or every six months, all right, Bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine because I actually get the medication now through the VA for free, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if you get the same one for free, let's do this, just so you can run a side\n\nSpeaker 2: by side, I'll send you something that's new and improved for free, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want you to run a side by side, do a dry run and see how this goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a call in a couple weeks to let me know how this goes and if you like this, we\n\nSpeaker 1: can go from there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll do a free replacement if you need something stronger and thank you for your\n\nSpeaker 1: service, Bud, because I'm a veteran on the Army, 18 Bravo, okay, Bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did eight years in Afghanistan, so what'd you do?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you do Navy or?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was a 68 Whiskey and-\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was in medical and-\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Iraq.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, damn, you did Iraq, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was already there a couple times.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they did a movie about you damn guys, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys are fucking badass, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you did that, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Damn, so you did Iraq when I was, I'm looking at your age, we're not too far apart in age,\n\nSpeaker 2: Bud, I thought you were older than me, you just sound a little older.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am older, I went in late, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no, no, no, but we're, I'm 72, you're 71, so we're not too far apart.\n\nSpeaker 1: Damn, Bud, 68 Whiskey, what an honor, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me, I appreciate your service and what you've done for us, you bled for us and you\n\nSpeaker 2: served those and you were there in the battle for those who bled.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you know how it is, we saw the evil and we saw the devil up front, you know, we\n\nSpeaker 1: see what people do, man, humans don't behave and they really, they can really drag it out\n\nSpeaker 2: of us, you know, but sometimes we have to activate that beast, you know, to defend,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, and let me, so I'm so sorry, Bud, but I'm glad that you made it out, I'm glad\n\nSpeaker 2: we're alive and we're here and I hope that you're 100% service connected, Bud, are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am, I am, are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, not yet, man, they make it really, really hard for me because a lot of the guys died\n\nSpeaker 2: that I was with, you know how it is, they ride it out, so I'm about 60%, but I do get\n\nSpeaker 1: some benefits, you know, still, as you know, but not a lot of them matter much, but if\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get 100% plus that back pay, man, but here in California, it's a long ass damn line,\n\nSpeaker 1: Bud, what do you recommend?\n\nSpeaker 2: Go to your local, look up your DAV, Disabled American Veterans, that's what I belong to\n\nSpeaker 1: and I actually, I'm a veteran rep and I actually help other veterans get their benefits.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll look it up, Bud, and I don't know, I just pulled it up now, Disabled Veteran\n\nSpeaker 1: Association, Disabled Veterans Claiming, Filing, okay, thank you so much, Bud, you\n\nSpeaker 2: know how it is, if we're not constantly on it and keep our finger on the pulse, we get\n\nSpeaker 1: left behind, you know, and they say, don't leave no man behind, but they leave us behind,\n\nSpeaker 2: it pissed me off, man, it really grinds my gears, but thank you for that tip, I'll look\n\nSpeaker 1: into that and I'll fight for that and I'll have you guys help me advocate for it and\n\nSpeaker 2: just let me know, Bud, if you need anything, I'm sending you something that's stronger,\n\nSpeaker 1: there's a time release on it, it's comparable, when you get them, they're going to look the\n\nSpeaker 2: same, but they'll say 5-0 on them, run that play, let me know how it is and if you give\n\nSpeaker 1: me the thumbs up in a couple of weeks, we'll go from there, all right, we'll start slow,\n\nSpeaker 2: all right, Bud? All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care, Larry, hey, take care and God bless you, man, Godspeed, thanks for your service, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye-bye.",
