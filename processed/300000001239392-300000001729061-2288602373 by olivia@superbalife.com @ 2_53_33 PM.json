    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Billy Funk.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Billy. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good. So I was calling to cancel the prescription I got from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay, Billy, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: March 30th, 81.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you're located at 13225 Meadowland Court, Gothport, Mississippi.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you do not want nor do you need the refill from today that you were charged for, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's exactly right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I just canceled and refunded that refill back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you won't be receiving it, but you will see a refund for $63.95 maybe as soon as the next few hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: But depending on your bank, it could take a few days. Keep your eye out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you don't want to receive regular ongoing refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that works is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah, I didn't know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, your prescription is placed on hold until the middle of August.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you need anything before then, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what's your name, Olivia?\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I appreciate it, Olivia. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you, Billy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
