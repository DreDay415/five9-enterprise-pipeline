Is this your phone number that you have on file with us?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: 917-449-9410?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment. While I do see you are a VIP customer here with us, sir, what's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 07666.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what was the first and last name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael Malero.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael Malero. Thank you. I do have you pulled up here, sir. Do you mind if I ask why it is you're canceling?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And just so you are aware, it's not like a frequency thing or it's not working for you because we can always, you know, set you up to order as needed or give you some time where you're not being billed or shipped anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. It's not working for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm just not interested in getting it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I was just saying, you can order as needed, which means you would only get orders when you call in, if that works better.\n\nSpeaker 1: I prefer to just cancel it completely right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I got you. I'll do that for you. Anything else you need?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. You have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
