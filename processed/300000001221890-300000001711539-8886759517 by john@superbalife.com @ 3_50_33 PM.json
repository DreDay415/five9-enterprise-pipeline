    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, John, this is Jeff Jackman. Hey, here a while back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered some, I thought I ordered the regular, that new Viagra with the whatever that is, the three letters, the new stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, and then it—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and so you guys sent me a bottle and I go, oh, it's generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I took two of them, didn't work, took another, it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't work for me. And then today I got another 10 tablets in the mail. I didn't order. Did I get charged for them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your zip code, Jeff?\n\nSpeaker 1: 97701.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I will look into all this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But first and foremost, if you didn't get the AGV, I need to fix that for you to start. So—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're on 62-970 Deschutes Road.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, this just says, what this bill said, I go, what the hell, it said generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: For Viagra, it doesn't say the new one. But I—\n\nSpeaker 2: I studied you guys, you guys got a good, good, you know, good start thing and I go, oh man.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I got another 10 today and I go, I hope I didn't get charged for them because they don't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, go ahead, do what you got to do. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, can you just tell me what's stamped on one of your pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well here, I guess I'll get this new one all open and see what it's stamped on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is stamped, ooh.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's hard to see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it just numbers or do you see letters too?\n\nSpeaker 2: All I see is a—\n\nSpeaker 1: 339.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then that tells me what I need to know. So that means it says AC-339. We did screw up, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I need to send you the AGV because yours would have said 50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace, to answer your other question—\n\nSpeaker 1: You were charged for this order, but I'm going to replace it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're not happy when you get these AGVs, you can return them and get a full refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, wait, no, no, no, start over, start over. I received the first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I just received another 10 pills today, a second order of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, I just said that, I know that, so I'm saying I'm going to replace all the orders though—\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you should have gotten AGV'd the whole time. I understand, well, I'm not being—\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not being charged for these 10, am I?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you were, sir. So what I'm trying to explain, if I could just get through it, is that I understand you were—\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand you were charged for that and you weren't expecting that—\n\nSpeaker 2: But I want to fix the order and you try the right thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're not happy with the right thing though, let us know and we can get you a refund, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's right, because when I ordered, I spent an extra $20, got an extra 10 pills, is that this?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's, no, no, no, no, so the first order was for, the first order is for 10 and then an additional 10—\n\nSpeaker 2: So you got 20 the first time, the refill was for 10, the charge for 10 is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I want those returnals, I don't want those.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't order for another prescription, I just wanted the first 20 I got, that's all I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't order, I didn't want another refill, I didn't order a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I just went over all that. Okay, sir, so just return it then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, how do I return it?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just send it back to the address on the bottle, that address in Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then they won't refill it, was it an automatic refill or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: The prescription comes with refills, but I'll close the account out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I don't, and then you're just going to send me new ones to replace the others?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll replace the first order, but that'll be the last time you can order, that'll be the last time you get it—\n\nSpeaker 1: Because when I close the account, it now cancels out your thing permanently.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well that's fine, I'll see if they work, if they work, I'll call you back and reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but that's what I'm saying, so you cannot reorder if I close the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I was trying to explain to you, I was going to replace everything—\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you weren't happy when you got the right thing, you could still get a refund on everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no, I'll send these back, I'm going to send these back, and I'll see if they work—\n\nSpeaker 1: And if they work, then I'll call in under a different name or something—\n\nSpeaker 2: But I don't want a refill every month, you see, I don't want $63 every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't have to be every month, I could do it as infrequently as once every six months—\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's only twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well, let's just see if they work first, but I don't want these that I have here—\n\nSpeaker 2: Because that means I spent $80 some, and see, that's $150 on these things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, sir, I will send—\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will send you the pills, but do not be surprised when you call back that you will not be able to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, hey, don't bother me, if that's the way you guys want to be—\n\nSpeaker 1: Just get me those sent back, or just can't, can I cancel the whole order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I cancel the whole order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Will you let me speak?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I already put through the replacement for you, sir, so there's no cancelling that—\n\nSpeaker 2: But I've cancelled the account, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: That's because you're running about 100 miles an hour, and you're not listening to shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just saying, I just want, you're not, you're, no, but you're going fast, you need to slow down.\n\nSpeaker 1: You need to listen better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you are to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you are to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not understanding you because you're going so fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: If this is the way you want to be, can you just cancel my whole order, my first one and this one?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's nothing to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: You already have the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't cancel something you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you just want to return it all, you can get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to return it all, you can get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we'll replace the first one, and then I'll return this one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll put it in an envelope and send it back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because, is there an address on here?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see, I'll make sure I got an address.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, there's my address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Kentucky, right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send it back to the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then they'll credit me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do they, and then they give me a credit after they receive?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do they credit me when I, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
