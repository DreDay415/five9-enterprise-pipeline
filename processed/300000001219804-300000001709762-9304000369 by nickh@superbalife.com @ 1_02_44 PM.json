    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, my name is Brett. Can I ask for a refund?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. Yeah, I can help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just provide me with the phone number associated with the account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, no problem. My phone number is 765-716-7510.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and can you provide me the full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, my full name is Brett Oller and my date of birth is August 21, 1959.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Brett, your account, it shows here that you called a few weeks ago and you put it on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's currently inactive. Can I ask you what has changed?\n\nSpeaker 2: If I don't remember, like, I just want to completely cancel it, can you help me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to ask for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you called about two weeks ago and there weren't any issues and then you paused your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, no further charges, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's paused currently, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to completely cancel my subscription rather than pause it because I might be able to be charged soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're not set to be charged any time soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Could you tell me when my service got paused?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, currently right now it's paused all the way until August 1.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: I see, I see. I don't remember, like, the last bill was on December 15, 1985 for $63.95, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, that was your last transaction and you called about a month after that to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, actually, can I change? I don't want to pause it.",
