    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Ralph Patton. I talked to you, I think, a few weeks ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your name again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Quinn. I talked to you about cancelling my prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you said you were going to send me some pills from France or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I didn't get them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it says they were delivered.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they're not delivered to my house. They weren't in my mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me double-check the shipping then, because they were sent out. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're still at 25445 Ramrock Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does say that that was delivered on the 20th at 1:29 PM at that house in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you have confirmation from the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, I don't know where they went then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been to my mailbox and looked, because I've been expecting them, but they didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: The one order that you reordered, just automatically reordered, that came through.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, which?\n\nSpeaker 1: The one that was automatically reordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it's weird. So why would one not go and the other one go?\n\nSpeaker 1: It came through, but it's gone, and it still hasn't done anything for me, so I'd just really like to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but what about the new stuff I sent you for free, sir? Obviously, the old stuff's not going to work. That's why I sent you something new.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know, but I haven't received it. And you said I have, and I have it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, how did the other one get there and that one not get there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you'll have to ask the post office. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, the post office confirmed that it was delivered to your address. If I ask them, that's what they'll tell me.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it wasn't. Trust me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, I know that I sent it, and the post office did confirm it, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, but let me tell you. You're making it sound like I'm lying to you. I'm not lying.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I would have said that. I'm just going off the facts.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't receive it. Well, the fact is, it did not receive here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and so you could understand how that could be very strange that everything else was delivered but the one package, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it is strange, but I didn't receive it. You want to talk to my wife about it? I've told her, she's looking out for it. We don't have it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just very strange. Very strange. Okay, all right, sir. We'll cancel it for you. We don't want to send anything else and it go missing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I get it, I'll send it back to you. How's that sound?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no worries. I mean, at this point, I mean, whoever got it or whatever, they'll keep it, whatever. No worries, sir. You'll never receive anything from us again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, someone got it. I don't know who got it, but somebody got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good for them. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's real easy with the way the post service is here. You've got various boxes. They could have put it in a long box.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, they don't confirm delivery to a particular address if that is the case, though. I mean, they confirm the delivery to your address, to your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: To my mailbox, right. But as I told you, there's 32 mailboxes and if they put it in the wrong one, which can happen, someone else got it. I don't know. I've been looking for it. I have no idea where it's at.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I understand, but for them to deliver one a couple days prior, the same exact package, but then get one two days after and then put that same package in the wrong one and not the one they delivered days prior, it just doesn't make much sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that's their job. That's all they do is deliver mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Don't worry about it, though. You won't get it anymore, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.",
