    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Joanna speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a question for you. On your score blue, on your score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, for example, I've had prostate cancer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now realistically, realistically, I'm getting advice from my lawyer on this,\n\nSpeaker 1: realistically, if I have prostate cancer, how can score blue help me?\n\nSpeaker 2: So basically my sex drive is nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, I want to start off by letting you know that we're a telehealth,\n\nSpeaker 2: so if you were interested in getting the AGV, what the next steps would be,\n\nSpeaker 1: you would complete your profile and a medical survey,\n\nSpeaker 2: which would be evaluated by one of our medical professionals who's writing the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm not a doctor, I'm not able to advise on whether or not the doctor would approve the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: but since we are FDA approved, we screen all of our patients,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's the reason we do the medical survey is to find out about their medical history\n\nSpeaker 2: as well as any medications they might be taking that could cause cancer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been taking Tadalafil for two years, okay, for example, okay, and that's not really helped me.\n\nSpeaker 2: My doctor gives prescription every time I have it renewed, Tadalafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I was wondering, really, what is this going to do other than Tadalafil?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I think that the best thing for you to do in order to find out would be to place an order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then, like I said, it'll be anything you want to mention to the doctor in that survey that we do over the phone,\n\nSpeaker 2: I would include it, so the doctor would reach out to you, and he would be able to advise whether\n\nSpeaker 1: or not he thinks that you would be a good candidate for the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: If he does not, for whatever reason, you would be notified and immediately refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much are the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Great question. So we have a couple of specials.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can do a quantity of 25 for $99 or a quantity of 40 for $100.\n\nSpeaker 2: 25 for $100?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: $4 a pill. Interesting. Okay, and what's the next quantity?\n\nSpeaker 1: You could do 40 for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's still about $4 a pill on this. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now, so insurance would not cover this, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. We don't accept insurance.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay. That's okay. We're looking at about $4 a pill should I try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just say that I tried this, and you got 25 pills. That's $100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if it doesn't work, how soon do I have to wait for you to refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you would just call us and let us know right away. We have a 90-day money-back guarantee.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do you do that? You just put it back on the credit card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's correct. You would just call us the same number you called today,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we would issue a refund on your card, whatever payment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, let me pray over this, because $4 a hit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like right now, with the dental fill, for example, it's supposed to make like 70 cents a pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get that through the drugstore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But okay, you've answered my question. Thanks for the courtesy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to mention real quick, sir, that we do cover, when you consider this,\n\nSpeaker 2: we do cover the cost of the doctor and shipping fees, just so you have that in mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: What doctor? What fee?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the doctor on our end. Remember I mentioned we would do a medical survey,\n\nSpeaker 1: and one of our medical, it's a telehealth doctor, so it's online. He evaluates it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that we pay for, as well as the shipping fees.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's very good. Well, thanks for the courtesy, and you have a wonderful day. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
