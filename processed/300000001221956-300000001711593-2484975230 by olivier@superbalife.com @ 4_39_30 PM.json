Do you want to be paused and you just want to order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I've been dying multiple times, so I'm dying and I don't need to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm cancelling everything, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. I appreciate all you've done for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, thank you. Everything is cancelled, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye, sir. Hopefully everything gets better.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're praying for a miracle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah. We pray for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
