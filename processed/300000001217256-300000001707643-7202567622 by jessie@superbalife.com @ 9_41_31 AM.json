    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. This is Roger Hofstetter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hofstetter. Great. Mr. Hofstetter, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm calling to cancel my account, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. And are you canceling this because the pills, you know, aren't working that well for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or is it just because of the frequency? Because it's like every two months, which is kind of a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's a change in health.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, gotcha. Oh, I'm so sorry. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. The one that was charged on the 25th, that one's already shipped out. I'll note that as your last.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm just going to throw this out there in case you want to do this, if there is a change in health,\n\nSpeaker 2: because your prescription is still active and you still have refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can pause everything for either four or six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that just puts everything on pause. You don't get anything in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: No surprises, no anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way, if you are still, you know, if things change and you still want to place orders down the line,\n\nSpeaker 1: your prescription is still active. Would you like me to do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. I wish it was possible, but no. Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No problem. Just thought I'd ask.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. No problem. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's been canceled, and the one that was charged on the 25th is noted as your last. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Have a great day. Bye-bye.",
