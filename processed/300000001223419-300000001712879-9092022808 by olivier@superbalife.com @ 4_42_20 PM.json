How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, somehow you guys charged my account again for the $413 or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I was canceled, I just wanted four tablets from the last purchase, and that was it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, oh, okay, okay, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: I already called my bank and stopped it, but I wanted to let you guys know because you just charged my account here a couple hours ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it was related to the prescription because usually when the doctor writes it, when you have low quantity, they write it every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unless you say you don't need it, now we pause or we stop, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, you just come with the prescription initially.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I don't want any more, so don't ship it to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm going to cancel and refund you that order here.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I canceled your account as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just be advised in case the price is up in the future because they're going to have to get you a new doctor or consultation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just cancel everything, brother. Just cancel everything, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I did, and I refunded you the refill, the 400. I just refunded you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thanks for your service, man. You guys are cool. That was fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.",
