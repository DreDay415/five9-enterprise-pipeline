    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Jay Pierce and I'm calling to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Mr. Pierce, I can help you with that. Could you confirm your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: January the 12th, 1947.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I see here the prescription was for the 100 milligram generic sildenafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: quantity of 10 each, is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I see here the doctor wrote it with refills. I want to let you know, Jay,\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it's kind of in small print on the notes from the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you're not required to get this every month. This is a subscription, not a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want it, I could simply pause it and that would allow you to call in\n\nSpeaker 2: and place future orders as needed with the remaining refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just want to cancel the prescription, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, for the doctor's notes here, was there issues with effectiveness?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, could you say that again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you have issues with effectiveness, side effects?\n\nSpeaker 1: Effectiveness.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, did you ever consider the AGV by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought that's what I was getting originally, but I got something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the white pills instead of the blue ones, but they're not working and I just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure. Now, here at Score Blue, we sell the regular blue pill, which is the name brand.\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell AGV, which is the newest formula from the same Pfizer company, and then we sell generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see your prescription was written for the generics, that you ordered it online.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if you meant to do the AGV, which like I said is the newest formula,\n\nSpeaker 1: it is proven more effective, I'm happy to send you 10 to try for free,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can see if those are better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because upon cancellation, it closes out completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want me to get you the AGVs to try, if that's what you meant to order?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right. So upon cancellation, the prescription does officially close out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So any future prescriptions would require new health consultation and survey and approval by a doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you accept these terms?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And Jay, you don't want the AGV. Like I said, I can replace them. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and took care of that for you. It's all canceled, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Bye.",
