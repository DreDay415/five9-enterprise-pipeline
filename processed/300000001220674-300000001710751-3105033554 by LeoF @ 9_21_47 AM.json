Can you cancel my membership?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what's your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jesse Nelson.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you out, Mr. Nelson. Looks like you got two of those orders on our VIP prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And were you just getting too many of the pills? Did that not work out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can, uh, pause this service for you if you wanted to place an order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can always give us a call or go online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, no, I'm just, I'm not gonna take anything. I don't really need it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. No problem, Mr. Nelson.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when I do cancel, um, I won't be able to open the prescription back up for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just wanted to make sure you're aware. We are the only FDA approved vendors of this medicine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything else comes from India, China. Really bad stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just wanted to make sure you're aware. I let you know, like I said, I could pause it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, uh, just cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you want me to cancel. No problem. I'll take care of that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did cancel, Mr. Nelson. Like I said, we won't be able to service you in the future, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, how do I get confirmation I'm canceled?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you guys keep charging my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you send me an email?\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem at all. It's not overnight. I'll see you in just a sec.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
