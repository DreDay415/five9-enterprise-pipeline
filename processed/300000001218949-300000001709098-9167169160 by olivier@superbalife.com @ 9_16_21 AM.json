    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is Joe Alvis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Mr. Joe, I'm pulling your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Joe Alvis in Slough House, California.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yeah, I see that you have a blue score blue VIP account and you have a prescription for Viagra 50 milligram, 10 tablets every 30 days from Dr. Tariq. How can I help you, Mr. Alvis?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to cancel my prescription. No, I don't want any more refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you want to order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to order as needed instead because you don't have to get refills and you can just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was just the initial...\n\nSpeaker 1: Written prescription for the doctor since you got 10 pills every 30 days. Most patients are active.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're just right there initially.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't need it, we advise the pharmacy to pause and you just order as needed, which kind of locks your pricing.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't get refilled or charged every month. You just order when you need, maybe once or twice a year, for example.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'd be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Let me advise the pharmacy that you're not active.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I'm telling them to stop the initial 30 days and then you're just gonna order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually they pause you up to half a year and you can just order so you don't get it every 30 days anymore. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Advise the pharmacy to pause the prescription and give us a call or press your quick refill button in your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when you need your 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'd be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you all set and you have a good week, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and can I say a few words?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the reason I'm putting pause on this is because this is not helping me out at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay. So how many of them are you taking? One, two?\n\nSpeaker 2: I took two at the most, which is that. It makes you go taking more than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, still helps a little bit but not much. The problem is I get the erection but it doesn't sustain itself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. So we're in good shape because you get the erection, because some people don't at all. So now...\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually do I take it on an empty stomach? You don't drink alcohol, coffee, stuff like that. Do you hit heavy at night?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I...\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a cocktail here and there?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I try not to eat anything after 7 o'clock at night. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So two things we can do. I can send you, but I'm not going to charge you...\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people from a different lab, the Viagra, to try is a different lab.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes it happens to work better because, you know...\n\nSpeaker 2: That's body chemistry and stuff like that. Or I can send you what we call an activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: You entitled that one time with your purchase.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a natural supplement who kind of pairs with the Viagra, helps release blockages.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you take two of them on an empty stomach for three, four, five days and then you can take the Viagra at the same time.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 60 capsules, a one-month supply, and if that's a support for you...\n\nSpeaker 1: You can google it yourself and order that even on Amazon and stuff like that. It's called an activator.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's the option I have to help you and, you know, it's free.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not charging you. You just kind of help even though the prescription is paused.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, kind of give you a little kick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think I'll just go off on that for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the prescription is paused anyway, and I wasn't okay charging you or selling you anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just that, you know, we want to ensure like...\n\nSpeaker 1: Success story with our patients, you know, so we want to make sure that, you know, they reach. So we try to, we have different tools...\n\nSpeaker 2: That we're trying to use to kind of have you maybe calling with a better...\n\nSpeaker 1: Testimony saying, oh, you know, you sent me that but that was kind of better for me. You know, I'm saying like stuff of that nature.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway...\n\nSpeaker 2: Pharmacy is aware.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was just on the side because you mentioned after we spoke about pausing, so I was trying to, you know...\n\nSpeaker 2: Get you something, but, you know, let us know if you change your mind. We have that for you available. Give us a ring. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so do thank you. Appreciate that. All right. All right, you all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good day. Thank you.",
