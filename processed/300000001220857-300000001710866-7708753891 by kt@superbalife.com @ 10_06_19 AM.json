    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Bilkinson, thank you so much for holding Bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I did exactly what you wanted and I did three things actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did Bud is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I looked further there was one that was trying to be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I put a stop to it. I wasn't able to reverse any charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I'm going to do is I'm going to bill Dr. Tu.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to send you a replacement for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because whatever he wrote that did not work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can replace for free and I do have something that's stronger and more improved.\n\nSpeaker 2: So don't worry, this is a good start.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as you communicated that it didn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can bill the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you the same prescription of 50 mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because that's what the doctor wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to send you part of our reserve AGB Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you take this Bill, you don't take it with any ultra-processed food please.\n\nSpeaker 1: No oily food, no ultra-processed grapeseed, olive oil.\n\nSpeaker 2: I take many precautions when I take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't take it with any other PE or EGP.\n\nSpeaker 2: I take it with an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so because of that, take it on a light diet, maybe some fruits,\n\nSpeaker 1: Some bananas, some mangoes, some watermelon.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you taste good for your partner.\n\nSpeaker 1: But just keep in mind, this stuff that I'm sending you is very powerful.\n\nSpeaker 2: It can go up to 10 to 12, 13 hours if you do it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just don't take it with high ultra-processed food.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 20 of them, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: To replace everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because what happened is, you had two orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: They were both wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: They were both not what worked for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if it didn't work for you, let's make it right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you 20 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to come to your address by next week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the weather is very bad right now in that area.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it will be 1209 Tree Creek Parkway.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there's no charge of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get this bill, please get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: How about the amount I get charged for?\n\nSpeaker 1: I will get a refund for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I was trying to do a refund, but I couldn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just replaced it instead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So in December, just hear me out.\n\nSpeaker 1: In December, you got something that didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: In January 27, yesterday, they charged you and they're trying to send it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I put a stop to that, but I'm sending you 20 pills to replace everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if this doesn't work at all because we're throwing you a Hail Mary,\n\nSpeaker 1: Then we'll talk about the refunds, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can't do that now because it's already at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: All I could do is replace it because the pharmacy takes a fee there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So in light of this, please, Bill, take down my extension so you can deal with me moving forward, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: You said your extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name, Bill, is KT.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to get these in about by next week because the weather is very bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just be safe.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless you, okay, brother?\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me in a week or two to let me know how these are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please don't take them with alcohol, drugs, only with fruit.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to enjoy this.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you need more, we'll set you up then, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's cross this bridge first, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Little by little.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Keep in touch, and God bless you, okay, Bill?\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Merci.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Merci.",
