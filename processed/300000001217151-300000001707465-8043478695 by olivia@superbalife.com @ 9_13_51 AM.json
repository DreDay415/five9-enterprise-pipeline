    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael Kaniglia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Michael. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been better. I mean I've been on hold for 24 minutes twice today\n\nSpeaker 2: trying to get through to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, well it is Monday morning and we opened one hour ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is probably why. Hello Michael.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm trying to do is cancel my account and stop the refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: It should be able to be done online. This is ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can definitely help you with that. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-11-65.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you are located in Omaha, Nebraska?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so if you don't want to receive those regular refills with your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place\n\nSpeaker 1: your prescription on hold for up to 6 months at a time just because 6 months\n\nSpeaker 2: is when the prescription would expire. If we didn't refill it\n\nSpeaker 1: and the way that would work if you did want to place it on hold today\n\nSpeaker 2: is that you could order over the next 6 months or before July 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: To be honest, I'm never going to reorder from you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Customer service is not good and this stuff doesn't work anyway,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's no different than a regular Viagra pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the pills, they didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't know I was getting automatic refills until I saw it on my credit card\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I got them. So I'm not trying to send them back or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Well, that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know, it is part of my job to let you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: if the pills don't work for you, it looks like you are qualified to try a free sample.\n\nSpeaker 2: It would be 10 pills of our newest, highest quality products,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is a superior prescription to yours.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're FDA approved, third party tested, all that good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about them specifically is they've been formulated to cut out\n\nSpeaker 1: the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they come with basically like a five month free trial\n\nSpeaker 1: where if I were to start that prescription for you with a free sample of 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: I could place it on hold for you until June while you try it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: make sure you love it, make sure you prefer it to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe you would, and obviously the old script is canceled\n\nSpeaker 1: because they don't work for you, so you don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what we believe would happen based off of the data is that you'd give us a call back\n\nSpeaker 1: in two to five months to order some, and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm willing to try that, and I appreciate it, and I'm willing to try that,\n\nSpeaker 2: as long as I don't pay anything and I don't get automatic refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I just don't want to – I don't even know, honestly,\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how many I would use because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: there's not that many times we do things, so, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, that's fine. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the new one, just so I know? I mean, I'm happy to try it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I appreciate it very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. So it is a new Viagra. It comes from our Pfizer labs in France,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's – yeah, it's the best stuff we have on the market.\n\nSpeaker 1: So isn't that what I got, the AGV? Isn't that the same thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. You were receiving our American stuff, and this is our French stuff, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, I'm willing to try it. I've never been with a French woman, so let's try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why not? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, this is going to be 10 pills, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ship them – and the sample is completely free, I want to be really clear –\n\nSpeaker 1: to 5634 North 142nd Avenue, Omaha, Nebraska, 68164?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. And you said you guys don't use them super often,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I can give you – I can do until July. So just let us know by July, either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to be a Wednesday, July 1st. But I think you're going to love them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you take them on an empty stomach, that's really important.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you want to avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not as much a safety issue. It's more just an efficacy\n\nSpeaker 1: and, like, success with the pill issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, I hope you enjoy these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific, at this phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I did submit a secondary ticket while I was on hold to say just cancel my account,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm sure they'll see what you did and they'll leave it alone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, cool. Great. Well, I hope you love these, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I appreciate your help. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.",
