How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I have a prescription and I want to check if it's the one Viagra with the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Robert Korb, K-O-R-B.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Korb, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it looks like you got the 100 milligram option.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I see here your prescription should have been written for the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 2: and what are you thinking? You got something different?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know. It doesn't say on the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the pills right in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do. I brought it. You ready? 987?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, take one of those pills out and let me know what it says on it, the actual…\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, I did that, too. Yeah, I did that, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I think it says 230 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that definitely would be wrong if that's what it says.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me look.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm reading how great that is and everything, it's one of the few…\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're not feeling that effect, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're not feeling the effect that's being described.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's… I've got to get more light. Excuse me, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your time. Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Going blind.\n\nSpeaker 2: Me, too. I believe it.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC3…\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it sounds like that is correct if it says AC on it, Mr. Korb.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's not right.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm going to do for you is I'm going to ship you out a replacement order of the entire order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you should have gotten the other pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you have there, they're still generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're just not the AGV, the newer pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course. That's no problem at all. I'm sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to ship this out to you. You'll see it on its way tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be there by the end of the week, Monday at the latest, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well, thank you so much. I'll throw these away.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, yep, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Yep, bye-bye now.",
