    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I recently, I guess I had gotten some in the mail, an order in the mail, but apparently I was set up on an order basis again to reorder. I want to cancel that. I didn't realize I had that set up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's take a look. Yeah, let's take a look at your prescription, sir, and see how it's organized. These are perfectly adjustable usually, so I'm not sure why it was set up with auto refills. Can I get the phone number under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 636-667-3553.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should it be under anything else?\n\nSpeaker 2: It would be under maybe my email.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, what's your email, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: This got charged just a minute ago for it. It just came through. It's $63 and something.\n\nSpeaker 1: I might be able to cancel it, so that's if you're online. So could I get your email address, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's johnritson at ymail.com. That's johnritson at ymail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Email's weird, sir. So John is first name, last name is what? Can you spell it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ritson. Ritson. R-I-T-S-O-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Interesting, okay. The phone number I have on file here is for the 639 number, not 636.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's supposed to be 636, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so we're in luck.\n\nSpeaker 2: You called, so I am able to cancel this before this goes through with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll see that refund issue in your account here shortly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I apologize for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, regarding the prescription as a whole here,\n\nSpeaker 1: like you mentioned, you're not required to do these monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just appears that the doctor set it up this way because of the low milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted, you could adjust this where you pause it\n\nSpeaker 2: and that'll allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have about 11 refills left under this prescription that you currently have access to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. No, I just, I want to pause it or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to keep getting charged right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, if you pause it, you won't get monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the point.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It keeps it open.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say, come April or May, if you want to do a refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can give us a call and you can get more of your medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you able to refund this one that just got charged then, you said?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I already did.\n\nSpeaker 1: You already did it. Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, if I need to refill it, I'll call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sorry about that, but we took care of it and you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
