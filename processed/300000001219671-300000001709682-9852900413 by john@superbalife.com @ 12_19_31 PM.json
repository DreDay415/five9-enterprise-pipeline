I'm starting to get worried that this was some...\n\nSpeaker 2: I was also fixing to call my credit card company and see if it did the process, but I think this is a legit...\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm listening.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's definitely legit. I was just going to say, if, let's say, somehow this gets lost and never shows up, we will just reship it to you, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: But I expect it to show up tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, I thank you very much. You've been so helpful, and you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, sir. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
