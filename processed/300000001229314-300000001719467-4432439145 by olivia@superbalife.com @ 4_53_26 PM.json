Last name Burke, B-U-R-K-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Tom. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It looks like you guys just billed me again on my credit card today.\n\nSpeaker 2: We canceled this account because there are no more refills done, but apparently that didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they billed me today. Can you stop the shipment and be done with it somehow?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm also very confused by this.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the first thing I'm going to do, because I know I've actually never seen this happen,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you were significantly overcharged, so I'm going to refund that really quick.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason I can't refund it all is because it was already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me do the math.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I keep calling and saying stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, but apparently you guys don't understand that word.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, we don't have any calls from you since you spoke with me back in August,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I sent you the AGV, and I said the script is going to be placed on hold for six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: so if the AGV doesn't work for you, just give us a call before then, and we just didn't hear from you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me see what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to go refund you $110, and then, yeah, if the AGV doesn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll email you the directions for how to return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've got to pay, what's it, $63.95?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that definitely is what should have been your price, not what you paid,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I do really apologize for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when I return it, I'll get that $63.95 back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and very soon, like in the next few days, well, depending on how fast your bank moves,\n\nSpeaker 2: maybe even right now, I'm refunding you $110.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you stop the shipment, save the time and effort on both parts and return it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was already shipped, like I mentioned.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So unfortunately, that part I cannot do.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I can, okay, so let me refresh your page to make sure that refund went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm going to email you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the email we have on file, it's T as in Tom, 55708020 at gmail.com,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to send right now the return and refund instructions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what I'm going to send is the more extensive option,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you're actually in a really good position because you haven't received the product yet,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you will in like three or four days, because that means you haven't opened it at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you do not open the package at all, if you don't want to go to the post office,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can just write return to sender on the package and leave it in your post box,\n\nSpeaker 2: and your post person will bring it directly back to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we can use the same tracking number to confirm it's on the way back to us\n\nSpeaker 2: and to receive it returned, and then we can process your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you want to follow the more thorough instructions and you want to go certified mail,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do have that option as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the email I'm sending you right now will have all of that information in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and I would have to pay for that, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I just sent that email.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will see that refund for 110 pretty soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, just once you receive it, you can either write return to sender on the unopened package\n\nSpeaker 2: and have a post person bring it back to us, or you can go to the post office if you want a quicker route,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because with that more extensive – with those more extensive directions I emailed you,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you want to more quickly send them the tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: and get the email team response fairly quickly and mindfully,\n\nSpeaker 2: they will be able to get your refund to you a little bit quicker than if you did return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Using the tracking number, you offer them via email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just cancel this account so we don't have to go through this anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I did that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, I'm sorry they didn't work out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a shame, but, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I'll wait to get it and check the refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Thomas.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
