Charles?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey!\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello!\n\nSpeaker 2: How you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi!\n\nSpeaker 2: Your name is Charles?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, your name is Charles. My name is Charles, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Love it. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's see. Who did I call here? Blue Square or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. Soar Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Soar Blue, yeah. Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Can I get your zip code, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: 04843.\n\nSpeaker 1: 04843?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you said your name is Charles. What's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said your name is Charles or it's Chris? I have a Chris Wolfe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles. Chris Wolfe. Same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your subscription should be under Charles Overholt. O-V-E-R-H-O-L-T.\n\nSpeaker 1: So not Chris Wolfe?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that how you have it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have Chris Wolfe in Camden, Maine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Well, that's me. I thought Charles put it under his name. I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: Either way, you need to cancel this subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is billing information, so if he says no, that's what matters.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Got you here then.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you're a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you just need to pump the brakes on receiving any product for a while?\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you overstocked?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Definitely overstocked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got you. Okay. We get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: As a VIP member here, Chris, you guys do have certain perks that you're able to utilize\n\nSpeaker 2: so that you keep the prescription in your back pocket.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of them is pausing everything for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you're able to use what you've got in order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but that cancels the subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: The prescription. No, it's not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a prescription written up with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So for the refills, we can pump the brakes for the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: We won't charge you or send you anything, and next time you need them, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: But does that cancel the subscription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Brother, there's no subscription. It's a prescription with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I apologize. Does it cancel the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it does not. It keeps the prescription alive and in your back pocket\n\nSpeaker 2: so you're able to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, it'll continue charging me $40 a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you work—no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said we're not going to charge you or send you anything for the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: After the six months, only one would come for the year.\n\nSpeaker 1: The rest of the time, you're able to order them as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: We will not charge you or send you anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. As long as there's no charge, I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay. I'll set that up right now, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give us a holler whenever you need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sir. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You use his account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do they send you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra.
