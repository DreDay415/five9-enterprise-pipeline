    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Livia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Todd Wesser.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Todd, how are ya?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, I'm glad to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today, Todd?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I've got a package here that I need\n\nSpeaker 2: to return and be refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Todd, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: January 2nd, 1963.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 210 Carriage Lane North,\n\nSpeaker 2: Unit 1601, Twin Falls, Idaho?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, yeah, I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you wanna return the most recent refill,\n\nSpeaker 2: is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, so I can email you the instructions\n\nSpeaker 1: how to do that, the email we have on file\n\nSpeaker 2: is toddwesser63 at gmail.com\n\nSpeaker 1: with two D's and two S's,\n\nSpeaker 2: two D's in Todd, two S's in Wesser.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you opened the package?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what that means is you can follow the directions\n\nSpeaker 1: in the email I'm about to send you\n\nSpeaker 2: if you wanna go the post office route,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to write return to sender on the package,\n\nSpeaker 1: as long as you have not opened it at all,\n\nSpeaker 2: so the package is completely unopened,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: they will bring it straight back to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we will be able to use that same tracking number\n\nSpeaker 2: to confirm that it's on its way back to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then inevitably that it gets back to us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we can process that refund\n\nSpeaker 1: once we receive it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then there's a $38 charge I got on my card,\n\nSpeaker 1: and to cancel the subscription, I guess,\n\nSpeaker 2: to talk to the doctor, I'll need that canceled also.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going into my bank, trying to find it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we've ever charged you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so your very first order was 63.95\n\nSpeaker 1: plus the 50% off bill upgrade,\n\nSpeaker 2: which was $14.70 that you selected,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the most recent refills were both 63.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is the same price as the original prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, this says J3JustAnswer.com,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't know what that is,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it was part of it to get a hold of the physician\n\nSpeaker 2: to cancel the prescription, it was kind of messing with me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's who's charging me $38.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you not affiliated with them?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I'll have to call them, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a phone number here in my bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great, so the pills, they just didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I thought I was getting the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just got the regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, if you do want to try the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send you out 10 pills on us,\n\nSpeaker 2: especially since you have already been approved by a doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: and you do have a prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you would at least get to try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Also, you wouldn't have to receive those regular refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you were interested in trying it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could place that prescription on hold for you\n\nSpeaker 2: for up to six months or until July while you try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure you love it, make sure you prefer to old script,\n\nSpeaker 2: run out of pills, presumably by then you certainly would,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you'd give us a call to order some,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if not, you just need to let us know by July either way\n\nSpeaker 1: because the prescription would be placed on hold\n\nSpeaker 2: for you until then, but it is superior,\n\nSpeaker 1: it is a better prescription than what you currently have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, yeah, I've got like two months worth\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I just got another one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, I don't have sex that much,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that's way overkill,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so I just wanted to cancel that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I will get ahold of this justanswered.com\n\nSpeaker 2: and cancel that one too, but yeah, I'll try the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So can I ship these 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm gonna do them at 50 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's what you already approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship them to 210 Carriage Lane North,\n\nSpeaker 2: unit 1601, Twin Falls, Idaho, 83301?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you should receive these probably by Thursday or Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, there is a winter storm,\n\nSpeaker 1: but Thursday, Friday, Saturday,\n\nSpeaker 2: maybe Monday in some wild fall, we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and just, I'll place the prescription on hold\n\nSpeaker 2: for you until July.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, we're always here at this number,\n\nSpeaker 2: Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you need anything before then, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I will go to the post office\n\nSpeaker 1: and just put return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the subscription is canceled, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So yes, that prescription is canceled,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then this new one that I started for you\n\nSpeaker 1: has been placed on hold with that 10 pill free sample\n\nSpeaker 2: that I sent you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I keep getting charged,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they send so many pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and like I said, I'm not that active\n\nSpeaker 2: that I need 120 pills or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well thank you for your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I shouldn't be, I shouldn't see,\n\nSpeaker 2: I should not see a withdrawal on my\n\nSpeaker 1: bank account, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again?\n\nSpeaker 2: The sample I just sent you is free, so no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
