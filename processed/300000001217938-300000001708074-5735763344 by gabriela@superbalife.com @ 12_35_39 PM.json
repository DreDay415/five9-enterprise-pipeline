How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I have a problem with your company there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I haven't, I've already canceled this once and I don't want any more\n\nSpeaker 2: billings on this Diagra thing, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want to give you, you keep sending me this score blue\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't know, I've ordered it once but you keep billing me and sending it to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's going on? Is it that you have enough supply at this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going on? Is it that you have enough supply at this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got plenty of it, I can tell you that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need all that and I don't want to be billed anymore for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's totally understandable, Roger.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you have enough supply, what I can go ahead and do for you is that I can pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you wouldn't be getting billed at the moment, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't want to be paused, I want to be canceled completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to give you my RX number, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, how are you liking the Diagra? How is it working for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know. It's okay, but I don't need to get a whole bottle every month or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you don't need it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's totally understandable, Roger.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I can go ahead and do for you, so that you don't receive it so often,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that I can go ahead and just adjust your prescription where you receive it only every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that means you would only receive it twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want that. Ma'am, here, let me explain this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: And here's my RX number, 9799374.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well you're all set. It's been canceled going forward, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
