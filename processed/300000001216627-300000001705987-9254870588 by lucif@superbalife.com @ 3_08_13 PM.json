    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for speaking. How can I help you? This message has been transcribed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello? Hello? Hello, are you there? Yes, how can I help you out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I've got your phone number off of the website for the score blue on a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: That I've been getting this, like a refill sent to me every couple weeks or so, and I\n\nSpeaker 1: need to cancel that prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I mean, yeah, because you can get this when you want it. You don't have to get it when you're not ready for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, somebody thinks my slugging percentage or batting percentage is better than it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, it'll go out how the doctor writes it. The only way it'll do that, though, is\n\nSpeaker 1: if you don't set it up how you want it to come out, whether it's what monthly frequency.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right. Is that something that I can adjust or amend on the website?\n\nSpeaker 1: Only for like a month or so, because anything larger than that, we would have to contact\n\nSpeaker 2: the pharmacy to make any major changes to the prescription. But, you know, we can have\n\nSpeaker 1: you do it as needed if that works for you better. So like in the next five months, you\n\nSpeaker 2: would have to call us for your next order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah, I guess we'll see that. Or what\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd be better off just canceling it and starting it up again when I need it, because I've got\n\nSpeaker 1: about four bottles of these that have been sent to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no. My wife is walking by laughing at me right\n\nSpeaker 1: now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's funny.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's tragic, too, due to the Friday and everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know. You would think you'd get a little lucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you don't put it into the week.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, no, I mean, we can postpone it so you wouldn't get any shipments or anything like\n\nSpeaker 1: that. I mean, for at least, like I said, about five months or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let's go ahead and do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, you can take my extension that way. If you need more time or if you need\n\nSpeaker 2: to shorten that, you can give me a ring and I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, let me get something. Hold on. Let me get up there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I will...\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me just a moment here. I'll get a pencil.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, let's go ahead and postpone that until June and see how lucky I get between\n\nSpeaker 1: now and then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've got high hopes for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's good to have a plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N, and the extension is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Okay, great. If you'll amend that for me, and if I need to make any changes\n\nSpeaker 1: in that, I'll get you a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, will do.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thanks. Appreciate it, Quinn. Have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye-bye.",
