I believe pharmacies need\n\nSpeaker 1: to put up to an hour medically or legally, but the pills should activate within about\n\nSpeaker 2: 11 to 15 minutes, so keep that in mind. We get that question all the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it sounds\n\nSpeaker 2: like I'm not the only one who's questioning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not at all, but from what I'm told,\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe the pharmacies need to put that on there for legal purposes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you\n\nSpeaker 2: very much for your patience with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, you're good. Give us a call.
