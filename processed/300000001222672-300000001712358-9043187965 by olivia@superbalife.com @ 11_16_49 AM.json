    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Roland Williams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Roland. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. Good. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I bought a product called Blue Touch, I guess it is. I don't know. Let's see. What is it called?\n\nSpeaker 2: Scorblue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Scorblue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's it. And it don't work. So I want to return it and get my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. We can definitely do that. So the email we have on file for you is gparibiansatyahoo.com. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my email, gparibiansatyahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I apologize if I mispronounced that. And then the shipping address for you is 2305 Northwest 51st Terre Ocala, Florida 34482?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. So I have two options. So I can send you an email, of course, with the information for how to return the product for a refund because they don't work for you. Or if you were interested, I would be happy to send you out a replacement of 10 pills of their newest highest quality Viagra, which I think would work for you and is a superior product. It is faster acting and longer lasting.\n\nSpeaker 2: But more importantly, it's been specifically formulated to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache. And if you wanted to try it, I could send it as a replacement and I think it would work for you. And then maybe you wouldn't have to return this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't think it will. So I just said not bother with that. Just refund the one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll send you that email right now then. Okay. Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. Rolling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the subject line is going to say return and refund instruction.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I just sent that to you and yeah, just follow those and you have 90 days after ordering it. And then yeah, once you have a tracking number, you'll just be able to respond to that email with the tracking number and yeah, you'll be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Thank you, Roland. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
