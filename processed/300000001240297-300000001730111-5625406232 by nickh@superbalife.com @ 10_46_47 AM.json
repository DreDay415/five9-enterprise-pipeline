    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. I scored blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, actually, I put an order in yesterday and I punched in the wrong email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's get this corrected for you, sir. Can I get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm 51866JamesLang, L-A-N-G.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the email I have on file is SouthBayAK3 at gmail.com. What's the correct email?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's SouthBaySKATE3 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha, so just the S for the K, or excuse me, the S for the A.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's like, yeah, S-O-U-T-H-B-A-Y-S, yeah, without the S, it's the 3.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, all right, let me update that for you. Sorry, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was going to say, I'm not on a reoccurring charge thing, like a membership thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So these prescriptions are adjustable. These are not subscriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Typically, for a lower quantity, doctors do start you off on monthly refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we can adjust this right now if you would like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want some time to try out the medication and see how you feel about it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, then I'll call when I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, so what I can do is I can put a pause on it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can try out the medication, then you can give me a call back after you've tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can let us know how to proceed. I can pause it all the way out until August.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then how much did I get charged?\n\nSpeaker 1: So after tax and fees, it was $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okie doke, because if I like it, I'm probably going to get a better deal next time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: The larger quantities do offer a little bit more specials.\n\nSpeaker 2: But like you all said, I updated that email for you, and you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cool, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, thank you.",
