    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you all keep trying to send me some more while you keep trying to tap my credit card, and I need to cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was supposed to be a one-time deal to try it out, and I never signed up for no prescription or nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, let me look at your prescription, and we'll see how it was organized. Can I get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Bradley Weber. Date of birth is February 9, 1962.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so, Bradley, what I'm seeing here is the doctor wrote your prescription back in September, and this is for a quantity of 50 of the 50-milligram Viagra. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it looks like the doctor wrote it with refills, so what happened right here, based on the doctor's schedule recommendations, it attempted to go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, you are not charged anything. Nothing has been shipped out, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've had it blocked on this end, but I keep trying. I mean, I've said it time and time again, and there's another attempt on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, it's just, you know, this is perfectly adjustable. This is not a subscription. You're not required to get this monthly or bimonthly, or in this case, every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted, you could pause this, all right, so this would not be automatically deducted from your account, and you could just simply call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I can live with that, but I don't want anything sent regularly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, exactly, so the next time you want a refill, just feel free to give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's what I will do, but y'all will stop tapping my card, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes, sir, that's not going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
