    "text": "Speaker 1: Mr. Kronberger, this is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Charles, my name is Kent Spaulding. How are we doing, Kent?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good, so I checked your product, filled everything out, had one shipped. I did not do recurring\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just had another thing come out through PayPal and I would like to stop that in all future\n\nSpeaker 1: uh transactions please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Lisbon Falls, Maine, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know where the recurring thing came from but I never authorized that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so when the person, when the prescription first gets written up just so you know it does\n\nSpeaker 1: come with refills just like any prescription does. What I did, I just reversed this one right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You won't be getting anything and then as far as the first order that you got,\n\nSpeaker 1: how are you doing on that one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me ask. I ordered Viagra ABG.\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that is not what I got. I got Cignaphyll 100 milligrams. I get, I'm a veteran,\n\nSpeaker 1: I get that through my DA. I didn't want that. I wanted to try the new ABG and that's not what\n\nSpeaker 2: they sent me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Understood. Can you do me a favor? Do you have the pills on you by chance? Our pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you do me a favor? Cignaphyll, first of all, Cignaphyll is an active ingredient in all\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. So, do me a favor. Pop out one of the pills and read to\n\nSpeaker 1: me what the pill says. It should have the number 100 pressed onto it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me cancel here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you want me to look directly on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: On the pill, yeah. I just want to make sure that\n\nSpeaker 1: you got the appropriate stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill says AC340, which is the exact same thing that I get\n\nSpeaker 1: through the VA.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, understandably so.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, let me do, I don't know if there was a mix-up or what,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if you're willing to, I can make it right. I can send you a replacement order of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what happened, brother. We might have ran out of the actual AGV and they sent you\n\nSpeaker 2: that instead. I don't know. Either way, I can message the pharmacy right now and have them\n\nSpeaker 1: send you it for free, 10 pills. I'll throw in another five just for the hiccup and then I'll\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure that nothing else gets charged for the next six months. That way you have time to try it,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay? Try it out and if you like it, call us back and let us know what the best refill schedule\n\nSpeaker 2: should be with it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I will do that, but right now you're shutting down all refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: A hundred percent. Six months, that way you got plenty of time to try\n\nSpeaker 2: this pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should be plenty of time for you to try one, two, three, four pills and then call us\n\nSpeaker 2: back and let us know what the best refill schedule should be, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, I will do that and because I\n\nSpeaker 2: was kind of excited to see what the new pill was going to be like because with generic is...\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, understandably so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so let me make it right for you, Kent. I'd expect these pills to\n\nSpeaker 1: arrive by maybe Monday or Tuesday. I'll see if I can throw in priority as well, but either way,\n\nSpeaker 2: the weekend's coming up, so maybe Monday or Tuesday next week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's fine. Now,\n\nSpeaker 2: let me ask you this question. The one that just came up there, you canceled that, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Hey, I appreciate you working with me. I just thought, well, I didn't think the\n\nSpeaker 2: doctor was going to allow it, is why I... I don't know. I was kind of confused why I didn't get the\n\nSpeaker 1: new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Understandably so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I'll make it right, Kent. My extension, if you need me in the\n\nSpeaker 2: future, you definitely will, obviously. It's 0040 and my name is Charles, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll write that down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Charles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, brother. I hope you have a great rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye. Hey, there's no...",
