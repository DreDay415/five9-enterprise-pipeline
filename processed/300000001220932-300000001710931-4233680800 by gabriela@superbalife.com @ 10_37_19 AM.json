    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Hi. I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Richard Litton, April 3, 1969.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Richard. Okay. What's going on? Is it that you have no supply at this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no. I can't take it anymore. I have atrial fibrillation and blood pressure problem,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the meds that I'm on are going to interact with the Viagra poorly, from what I'm told.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah, no worries. So, due to your medical condition,\n\nSpeaker 1: your prescription has been canceled moving forward, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I hate to ask you, but there's one pending. Can we cancel that one as well?\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't show from my end that there's an order pending, Richard.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. That works. Thank you, dear.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you're all set. You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, hon. Bye.",
