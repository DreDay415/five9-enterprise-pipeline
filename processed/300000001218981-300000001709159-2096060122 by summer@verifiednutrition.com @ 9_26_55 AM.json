And then how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I ordered the new AGT that you guys have.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they sent me the regular 100 mil, not the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I received the same order that I've been using, and I wanted to try the new stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see. Okay, I'm going to send you out the right one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you still on Villa Ramen Drive?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do you want me to send these back to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you don't have to send them back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.
