I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you say that again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Apologize. Yeah, this is Arnie speaking from Viagra score blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, it's Arnie?\n\nSpeaker 1: Arnie. Arnie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Arnie, I have a...\n\nSpeaker 1: Why?\n\nSpeaker 2: I still can't hear you. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, let me see. Can you hear me better?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's really like...\n\nSpeaker 2: You sound like you're talking through a...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, there you go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, okay. Yeah, so, yeah, this is Arnie from Viagra score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I ordered product from you guys a while ago,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just got another prescription sent, and I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered it one time to try it, and I just didn't like it,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I never ordered another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this one got sent to me, and I don't want to get billed for it\n\nSpeaker 2: because I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: From what I can see, usually your prescription comes with refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if you don't need it, it has shipped already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do one thing for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just write refuse...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it was delivered actually today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just write refuse return to the sender on the box.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just write refuse return, leave it in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: The mailman is going to take that back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Refuse.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, refuse return on the package, and then put it in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: The mailman is going to understand that he got you the wrong package\n\nSpeaker 1: and send that where it came from.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you say you didn't have a good reaction with that?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it wasn't good at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm like, I don't want the product again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that was your first time using Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I had to open up the package to, like, look at it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, like, it wasn't in a box.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was in an envelope.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tape it nicely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Write refuse return.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I was saying, that was your first time trying Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: One.\n\nSpeaker 1: Olly, what were you saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was saying that was your first time using Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's no good for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, some people are not made for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're made for Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you've tried Cialis before.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, listen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Olly, listen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Olly, Olly, Olly, Olly, listen to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because your company sent me another prescription that I didn't order,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to deal with you guys at all now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because to me it looks shady.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why would I get sent another prescription that I didn't order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Michael, do you mind me giving you the information?\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe you didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe I was interrupted by maybe the connection.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was explaining that initially when the doctor wrote it,\n\nSpeaker 1: due to the fact that 95% of the patients are active,\n\nSpeaker 2: you wrote it with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you don't need refills, when you call like you do right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: we tell the pharmacy, Mr. Michael, Mr. McPherson is not active,\n\nSpeaker 1: so pause his prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: For example, if he was working for you per se,\n\nSpeaker 1: if the Viagra was sitting well with you,\n\nSpeaker 2: pause it, you don't need it to be sent, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: But initially it's made like that because most patients call to rush order\n\nSpeaker 1: and complain to be online, not be able to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the reason why they get your refill, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered it online, and I ordered one time, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because there was an option like for no refills, like one time buy,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's what I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they still sent me another bottle that I don't want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just return it for your refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to get billed for it though.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why we're doing it right now, Mr. McPherson.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're resolving the issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just by refusing it, you get your refund, we cancel the account,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's move forward, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So do I need to call my credit card company and tell them not to pay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, do whatever you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I offer you some solution.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if you hear what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told you we're going to refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Return that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I close the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is nothing else I can tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you close the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's what I'm doing for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you're going to get your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just return that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You get your refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, listen, do you have a confirmation number that it was closed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to provide you anything you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's move forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand your concern.\n\nSpeaker 2: I agree with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand your concern, and we're trying to resolve here, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the number will be 6F, like Frank.\n\nSpeaker 2: The number 8.\n\nSpeaker 1: The E, like Eagle.\n\nSpeaker 2: The number 5.\n\nSpeaker 1: F, like Frank.\n\nSpeaker 2: A, like Apple.\n\nSpeaker 1: 299.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the confirmation number for the cancellation.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, they deliver it to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just write refuse return on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's open, tape it nicely.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to get your money back, 163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing to worry about.\n\nSpeaker 2: The money will be back.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it was taken, it's going to be back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just return the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very simple, and the account is closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Refuse return the sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like the mailman is going to think he got you the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's got to lawfully send that back to where it came from.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't have to pay anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you take it, you walk to the post office, they're going to try to do\n\nSpeaker 2: business with you by telling you they've got to charge you for that when\n\nSpeaker 1: really they don't have to charge you.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you put refuse return, that means that's wrong in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: They've got to take that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: They should not charge you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So usually leave it in the mailbox so, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: they don't confuse you when you walk inside the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you do go to the post office, don't talk to nobody.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just drop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: When they see that, oh, that's a return.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you go to the desk, they try to charge you even though they don't need\n\nSpeaker 1: to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my account is closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fully closed, Mr. McPherson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Ollie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do that and you're going to get your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that tracking number, when you do the return or if you want to hand that\n\nSpeaker 2: to your mailman saying, oh, that was wrong, that don't belong to me,\n\nSpeaker 1: when you're going to click on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: this tracking number is going to be updated showing that the package is\n\nSpeaker 1: coming back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your account is closed and you're going to get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
