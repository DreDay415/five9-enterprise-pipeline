Bryant, Jr. 5259.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, James, I see the prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: was initially written on January 8th for the 50 milligram\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra, a quantity of 10, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know it was going up again, but I know it's going\n\nSpeaker 1: to be more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, so the doctor did write this with refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that was based on the low milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is not required that you get this every month\n\nSpeaker 1: to retain a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you do have about 10 refills left\n\nSpeaker 1: under the script written by the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted, you could simply pause it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then that would allow you to call in and place\n\nSpeaker 2: future orders as needed and have access\n\nSpeaker 1: to the remaining refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, if I pause it, it won't send me no more until I call, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you would no longer receive these monthly,\n\nSpeaker 2: and this would be paused all the way up until August 31st,\n\nSpeaker 1: is what I can pause it to.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to place an order before that date,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can give a call at any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just go ahead and stop it completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so upon cancellation, it does close out\n\nSpeaker 1: that prescription altogether.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so any future orders would\n\nSpeaker 1: require a new health survey, approval by a doctor,\n\nSpeaker 2: and consultation, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I went ahead and did that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
