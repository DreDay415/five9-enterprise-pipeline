Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Just not ready for any product at the moment?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just not ready for any product at the moment?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want any at all. I just wanted to buy one bottle of 10 to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, every time I try to do a new thing, to try something,\n\nSpeaker 1: they always put me in a subscription and keep sending me more and taking money out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: and sending me more and taking money out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: All I wanted to do was buy one bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not mad at you. It's not your fault.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I'm saying is it doesn't make any sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, if I want one bottle, I should be able to buy one bottle\n\nSpeaker 1: and not have a ton of bottles show up at my door,\n\nSpeaker 2: and next thing I know, I check my account, and I'm negative something\n\nSpeaker 1: because I've only wanted one bottle, but they're sending me five or six.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything going forward has been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything going forward has been canceled. You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Am I getting a refund for that last one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I already reversed it. It'll take a couple of days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine. I figured that. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
