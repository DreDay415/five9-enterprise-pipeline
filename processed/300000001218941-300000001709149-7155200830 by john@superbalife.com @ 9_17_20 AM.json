I was looking at my account last night and somehow placed an order and I didn't want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how you do that, but okay, sir. One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Arvid Johnson, A-R-V-I-D. Johnson, 5-4-8-0-1.\n\nSpeaker 1: Rocky Ridge Road, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So because this went in overnight, it was already put in the mail this morning, sir. You're going to have to return it when it arrives to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when it arrives, do a return to sender and then it'll come back to us and we'll refund you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And so am I on like a subscription now?\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do is I'm going to close your account entirely so this doesn't happen again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you won't be able to order at all, but that way it won't happen anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I don't know what you did, but just return it and you'll get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
