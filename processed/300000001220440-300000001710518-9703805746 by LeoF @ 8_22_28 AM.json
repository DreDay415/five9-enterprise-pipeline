    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is Doug Queen. I ordered some Scor-Bru, the A-G-V Pfizer pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they sent me just regular generic pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have those? You said Doug Queen?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you said your name was Doug Queen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you at 9419 North Broken Bow?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Queen, I'm really sorry about that. Do you have those pills there in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you mind taking one of those pills out of the bottle and let me know what the markings on both sides say, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: There's nothing on one side.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it says, I can't hardly read it, A-C-N-3-3.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, no, that tells me all I need to know there, Mr. Queen. So you did get the incorrect thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a very similar generic to the ones that guys get at the VA.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do still sell those. Those are generic Viagra. I mean, you can take it if you want, but it's not the A-G-V you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm really sorry about that. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, first and foremost.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do for you, of course, I'm going to send you out a replacement order today.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like there was just a little glitch in your order. A few of these, like the machines, have just filled them incorrectly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'm going to do for you, of course, I'm going to send you out a replacement order today.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll see that come by in the next few days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pills that you have there, they are still generic Viagra. I mean, you can take them if you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can toss them if you want. You don't have to send them back.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll send you these new pills either way, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they don't work for me very good, so that's why I wanted to try the new ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'll send these out to you, and we'll get this taken care of for you really quickly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see them come out in the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll have different markings on the pills. That's how you'll know they're different, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
