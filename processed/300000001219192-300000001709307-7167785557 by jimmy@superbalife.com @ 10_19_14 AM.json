    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me pull up your information there and see if I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pretty sure I can. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trying to pull you up with your phone number. Is this Bruce I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Bruce. I do have you up. I'm looking at your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you're currently getting the Viagra 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you're getting 40 of them every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ask you any reason why you want to cancel, Bruce, if you don't mind?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I'm just not using them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem. I see you're getting a large quantity there, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you, Bruce, to help you out here to keep your subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just cancel my subscription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem. We're going to cancel. I do have to tell you, by you cancelling your subscription,\n\nSpeaker 2: that means you will not be able to order from us in the future because we do have to have a prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I was just going to recommend that we can still postpone it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's fine. It's fine. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'll go ahead and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see you just had an order recently shipped out to you, and I will stop all future orders going out.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are the pills working for you? I'm just curious, the 50 milligrams, when you were using them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I don't even know if I used any of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem. So I went ahead and took care of that for you, Bruce.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unfortunately, because we are on a first-come, first-served basis, and we typically are sold out for any canceled prescriptions\n\nSpeaker 1: because we only take care of our prescriptions that are active and any new orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you did in the future want to order, we've got to tell you to order from us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Not a problem. I'll just take care of it for you. You're all done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Bye. You too.",
