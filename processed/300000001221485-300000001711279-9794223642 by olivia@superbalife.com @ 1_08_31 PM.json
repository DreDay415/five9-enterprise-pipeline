    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is William Russell.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi William, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hang on one second?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to find my emails here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're a school bully, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had a prescription with y'all for many years that I get filled,\n\nSpeaker 1: not necessarily on a regular basis at all, but I get 50 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You order 50 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you see it associated with my phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I believe I see all of your information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just confirm your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: January 2nd, 1960.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, yeah, I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I heard that y'all had, and so I have another prescription by my\n\nSpeaker 1: doctor that's a lot cheaper than buying through y'all, but I don't know that\n\nSpeaker 2: he has the new, what, AGV or whatever it is?\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'd like to try some.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was wondering if I could order the 40 pills at 100 milligrams for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you want to do, and I'm imagining you want to stick with the 100\n\nSpeaker 1: milligrams, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I am going to force new consult because, yeah, it'll be a new prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, are we going to be shipping it to 702 Dover Drive, College Station,\n\nSpeaker 2: College Station, Texas, 77845?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and the card?\n\nSpeaker 1: I will need to update my card, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the new card, just debit card, 4005701900227505.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration 129.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: You need the three digits on the back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Please.\n\nSpeaker 1: 898.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to read this back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a Visa, and the number I believe you gave me is 4005701900227505,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the expiration date is 01-29, and the CVV is 898.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the name on the card is William Lee Russell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that should be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, so this is for the Viagra AGV, 100 milligrams, 40 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so it's 149, and then the pharmacy fee is 1495.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I will just place that right now, and then it should be out to you within the\n\nSpeaker 1: next three to six business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, that winter storm is wild, so we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a way to expedite that for an additional fee?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to add express shipping, but the thing is,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're shipping out of Kentucky, right,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that is kind of one of the epicenters of where things are happening.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you could do next day air, but we've missed the cutoff window,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it would be you'd be paying for next day air,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it wouldn't get there until second day air for $38.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could do third day air for $28, or you could just do general priority mail\n\nSpeaker 1: for $15, which priority mail is usually three days.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you think it's worth it?\n\nSpeaker 2: So today is Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: The thing is, so if I was going to do it,\n\nSpeaker 2: I would do the simple $15 priority mail and hope for the best,\n\nSpeaker 1: but keep in mind that there's like maybe a 70% chance it gets to you by\n\nSpeaker 2: Saturday, but then if it doesn't, it doesn't get to you until Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is like the risk, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I increase the chance of it getting by Saturday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or do you think the weather is just too bad right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: A little bit of both.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean you could do second day air,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's really going to be third day air because we've missed the cutoff\n\nSpeaker 1: window by a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you could do third day air, which is supposed to guarantee Saturday,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's different.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's going to be FedEx, and that's $28.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how much is it for first?\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's second day air, and so it's either going to be $28.\n\nSpeaker 2: The real options really are second day air for $38,\n\nSpeaker 1: or three day air for $28.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which one?\n\nSpeaker 2: The three day air I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds like the best one, doesn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, for $28.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so I will add that, and then I'll message shipping,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll ask them to get it out as soon as possible, and that will be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and my bank is asking me to approve this charge right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess I don't know who you all are, so I'm calling them right back.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to be $163.95 now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be $163.95 plus $28, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So as you run this next one, you're just going to run a $28 charge on it, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not going to do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so it just shows up as two charges, one a $163, one a $28,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'll tell them it's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I will message them right now, and it should be out to you really soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, William.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
