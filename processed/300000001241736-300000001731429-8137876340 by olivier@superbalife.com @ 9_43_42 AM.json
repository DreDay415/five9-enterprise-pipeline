Hey, I need to speak to somebody about cancelling my subscription, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let me pull the prescription here for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. David White? Yeah, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see you have a prescription for 25 mg Viagra, 10 tablets, I think, every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any health concern, or you just want to order as needed? You don't want to go based on the initial prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't realize it was an ongoing thing. I ordered them one time. I didn't realize it was an ongoing thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys just billed me again, so I don't want that to happen anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's just the initial writing, because I think you got 10 tablets and 25 mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: So most patients get four of them to make it 100, so they assume that after two shots, you're probably going to need to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they wrote a prescription with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can cancel the monthly, they would refill with it, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can cancel those refills, because that's not required.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is not Netflix. Obviously, this is medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then pause the prescription, and you can just order as needed instead.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to be there every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm having a hard time understanding what you're saying, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is real simple. I don't want to get billed every month, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to cancel the monthly and pause the prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it, so you can reorder, okay, as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you get two refills a year, you can get the same price always.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it? Done?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's it. I'm going to cancel the 30 days and pause it for half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can reorder yourself, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
