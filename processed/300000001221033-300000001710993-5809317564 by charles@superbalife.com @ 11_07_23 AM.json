Yeah, I got an email yesterday saying y'all was sending another one to me, and I don't need another one right now. So I just need to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha, everything's canceled. That one is on its way. When it arrives, Michael, don't tear it up, don't do anything to it other than write return to sender on it with a marker or pen and put it back in the mailbox, and the mailman will take it and send it back to us for a refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Take care. Bye-bye.",
