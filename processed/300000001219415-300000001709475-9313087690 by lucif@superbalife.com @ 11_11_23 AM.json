I don't mind doing that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you ordered the wrong thing, that's perfectly fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't mind resh... I can reship it for you. That happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you were looking to get the AGV, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: You were looking to get the AGV? The newest stuff that we have?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me...

No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you don't want to keep them as a backup,\n\nSpeaker 2: you could throw them, toss them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I just did reship that to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any other questions you might have or anything?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. That's great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.
