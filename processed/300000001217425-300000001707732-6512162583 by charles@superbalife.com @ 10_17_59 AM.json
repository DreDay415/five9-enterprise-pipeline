    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles. Yes, I had a charge from a credit card over\n\nSpeaker 2: the weekend for some bills that I didn't order. And I'd like to know why I'm not getting charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got Paul McNamara. Yes. Yes. Okay. So your VIP status with us, it does come with refills\n\nSpeaker 2: when you sign up. Do you not necessarily need this order just yet? I'm assuming you're still\n\nSpeaker 1: working on that first order from October, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right. I don't want my orders\n\nSpeaker 1: gone there in July to call an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me go ahead and handle that for you. So\n\nSpeaker 1: nothing comes your way. Boom. Okay, that's done. You should get that cash back soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then do you just out of curiosity, Paul, do you want to lower the quantity down to 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd be saving like $100.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't want to order. I don't want to do it yet until I need\n\nSpeaker 1: them. I'm just saying for the future, that way you have a better deal. You know, I just want to\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you have it handled now. That way in the future, there's no surprises or anything. So\n\nSpeaker 1: yeah, I still don't want anything put on there unless I order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand that. I'm asking\n\nSpeaker 1: for your future orders, right? Do you want to drop the quantity down to 10 so that you could\n\nSpeaker 2: be saving about $100 for your next refill, especially if you're not using them as much? A\n\nSpeaker 1: lot more, how would you say, efficient, I guess? That way, you know, it's only $63.95 for the\n\nSpeaker 2: entire order for 10 pills. And then we can pause everything for like five months at a time. That\n\nSpeaker 1: way you got plenty of time to use what you've got. And then if you need them earlier, just give us a\n\nSpeaker 2: call and let us know specifically how we go about these things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, thank you. I don't want\n\nSpeaker 2: it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Okay. So what I could do is just, like I said, pause everything for the next six\n\nSpeaker 2: months. We won't charge you or send you anything. That way it keeps the prescription alive and in\n\nSpeaker 1: your back pocket.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I hope you have a great day.",
