    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to get a refill, but my card, I guess I switched my credit card, so the process won't go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one second to pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to try to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Technical difficulties. Okay, there we go.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Randy, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: May 24, 1984.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The question is, I was looking yesterday, and I see that there was one for 100, for 25, 100 grams, 100 grams?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was 25, 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, a quantity of 25 is $99, and the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee, so that's why it comes out to $113.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but what I'm saying is, I've seen another one that said you get 22, 22 is still 100 strength, and there's a little more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why is that?\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have, they don't come in quantities of 22.\n\nSpeaker 2: The website is showing, no, it's showing 100 strength, and some are 25, lower, and I see one that was 22.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that's another $137.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, oh, that's the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the difference?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the AGV is Pfizer's latest formula, so it kicks in faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: People say they go kick in 11 to 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the bottle, it will take one hour prior, and it lasts in your system longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It lasts for 14 hours and less side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just a better formula, and honestly, it's cheaper than, the AGV is cheaper than just the regular generic, and it's better.\n\nSpeaker 1: And generic, what's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Generic is it's regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why is it less and cost, why does it cost more and get less?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because we're running the specials on the AGV right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's the same thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV is actually better.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why that is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, because, I know, because it comes from a different manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV comes from, we're directly contracted with Pfizer's manufacturer in France called Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why we get it at better rates.\n\nSpeaker 1: And because the generic one is by the manufacturer Apto in the U.S., so that's why that one costs more.\n\nSpeaker 2: But as far as like strength, it's the same strength?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the AGV is actually stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the one I have been purchasing, it's the best you have to offer?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're getting a 3X, which is a step up from generic, but it's not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV is the top-of-the-line quality one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how much is that one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Same price, $125 for $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, you broke up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said the next one was a step up?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the AGV is the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: You get a quantity of 25 for $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then you said there's one better than this one, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: The one that you're getting, yes, the AGV, and it's the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I thought you said there was one that was a step up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the one I got is the best one you guys have to offer?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got the step down from the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the one I'm getting is that AGV?",
