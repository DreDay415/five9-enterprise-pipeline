    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling, Viagra, this is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I had ordered a prescription of pills, and I have them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then today I went to the mailbox, and there's another prescription of pills in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't order those.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why I'm getting that again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to have to pay for those.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dominic Contilego?\n\nSpeaker 2: Colangelo.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Colangelo.\n\nSpeaker 1: Totally off.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fort Chester, New York.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: When your prescription gets written up, Dominic, it does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't want that one, all you got to do is write return to sender on it, put it back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mailman will take it and send it right back to us, and we'll issue the money back for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then as far as the first order that you placed, how are you doing on those?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I still have a few left.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's not like I'm having sex like every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wish I was, but that's not the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I don't want any more pills from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you like the pills, though, overall?\n\nSpeaker 2: They're okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you'd like, for your next—if you'd like, I can send you something a little bit different.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see you've only been getting the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we are with Pfizer, brother, so I have different variants of the Viagra AGV that I can send off to you\n\nSpeaker 2: that might be a little bit more potent.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll send it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically, what I did was, you know, I did a thing of, like, you know, ED medications that are the safest.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, of course, you know, whenever I was on, I don't know what website I was on, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: they gave me this whole thing, and they did a list of things, and they were saying, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: these things definitely stay away from.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they gave a list, I forget, of, like, two or three that were, like, the safest out of all of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And obviously the one that I picked, yours, seemed to be the safest.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, whether that's really true or not, who knows?\n\nSpeaker 1: It could all be just a sales gimmick.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I went with that, and that's why I went with those.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, before I did that, I did contact my doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I said, you know, listen, because of COVID, I really haven't been as sexually active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I'm starting to, you know, date again, and I'm going to be sexually active.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was like, for the first time in my life, I'm kind of a one and done kind of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I used to be able to stay hard for three to five sessions.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, at 67, it doesn't work that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, it was my first time realizing that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I never had that issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, that's why I did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But he just said a low dose, so that's why I got those.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if it's really not doing anything for me, then what's the point in spending the money, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, like I said before, I really don't want to sell you anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we do have something that can work and give you that kick that you're absolutely looking for, Dominic,\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to see if I have the different variation available to send you as a sample for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll message the pharmacy and have them send you over 10 free pills of the AGV that's made in our France factory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: With Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it'll be a little bit more potent on the dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll stay at 50, but it'll give you the—I guarantee this one's going to give you the kick that you're looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm going to send you 10 free pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Try them out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll make sure everything in the future is paused for the time being for the next five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give you five months to try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us back and let us know what the best refill schedule should be.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I won't get any more of the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: I won't get another order of the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Negative.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the pill that you're going to be looking for now will have the number 50 pressed onto it like a stamp.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
