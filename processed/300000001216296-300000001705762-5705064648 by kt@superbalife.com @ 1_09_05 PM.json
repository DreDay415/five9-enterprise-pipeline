    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Rodney, this is KT Goodrich again. Thanks for holding Bud. So I did exactly\n\nSpeaker 2: what you wanted. I actually did three things. The first thing I did is I put a\n\nSpeaker 1: stop to any and all monthly refills. I overruled the system. I put a stop, Bud, to any and all\n\nSpeaker 2: monthly shipments. And the third thing is I surely put a stop to any and all\n\nSpeaker 1: monthly charges. And I paused your prescription and I elevated to lead\n\nSpeaker 2: status. And what I found on your chart is you needed something stronger. So\n\nSpeaker 1: because you paid money already, hold on to what you got. They're good stuff. They\n\nSpeaker 2: just don't work for a man like you and me. We need something stronger, Bud. You\n\nSpeaker 1: know, I always tell these doctors and these scientists, I said, damn, you guys\n\nSpeaker 2: probably read books and and play video games. But with all due respect, man, men\n\nSpeaker 1: like me and Rodney, basically, you know, I tell them we need something that's\n\nSpeaker 2: kick-ass. Something like an AR-15, right? We're not there like trying to shoot a\n\nSpeaker 1: Daisy BB gun or a Nintendo gun. So what I'll do for you is just hold on to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna send you 20 pills to replace everything you have for free. It's gonna\n\nSpeaker 1: be stronger. It'll release in about less than 30 minutes. This thing, just be\n\nSpeaker 2: careful with them, okay? This is the best stuff we have, okay? I'm gonna replace\n\nSpeaker 1: them pill for pill, no charge. I'm sending into your 1734 address, okay? And\n\nSpeaker 2: then take down my extension, Bud. My extension is 0037. Let me know how\n\nSpeaker 1: these things go. Then give me the thumbs up and relight. Then we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You already have something that got shipped to you and you got charged. Just\n\nSpeaker 1: hold on to those. Maybe give it to someone else, you know, that's, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's less, you know, younger. Younger, you know. Oh, can I do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I'm just saying hypothetically, right? That's\n\nSpeaker 2: up to you. But I'm gonna give you 20 pills of something more stronger, new and\n\nSpeaker 1: improved. And then write down my extension, Bud. My extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have that. 0037. No, but the extension, my personal extension. Who am I\n\nSpeaker 1: asking for? You're always gonna come to me. KT Goodrich. What is it? KT\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodrich. Okay. Yeah, so KT Goodrich. Let me know how these things go and then\n\nSpeaker 1: will give me the thumbs up and I love to hear the feedback because you'll love\n\nSpeaker 2: this stuff. This is the best stuff we have. And then if there's any consolation to\n\nSpeaker 1: you, I want to set up a, I set up a red button for you. So in the future, if you\n\nSpeaker 2: don't want to call in, go to scoreblue.com. Log in with your Gmail, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Your Reverend, right? The Reverend, right? And then you're gonna go to a category,\n\nSpeaker 2: Bud, that says your prescription. You're gonna see a red button with white font.\n\nSpeaker 1: That says quick refill. So if you can't get a hold of me, click that button. The\n\nSpeaker 2: only caveat is you can't get more than one refill per month within a 30-day\n\nSpeaker 1: period. And you can't get less than two refills a year. But try these out. You're\n\nSpeaker 2: gonna love them. They're the best stuff we have. And then give me the thumbs up\n\nSpeaker 1: in a couple months. All right, Bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, KT. Appreciate you, man. Hey, Abed. Hey, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know how it is. Mark 1124. Therefore, my brother, and I say to you, Rodney,\n\nSpeaker 2: whatever things you ask when you pray, believe in your heart that you'll\n\nSpeaker 1: receive them and you will have them in Jesus' mighty name. All right, Bud? Go ahead, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I appreciate that. Yeah, we touch and agree on that. We're in agreement. We're in the same\n\nSpeaker 1: frequency. Ask, seek, knock, ye shall find, it shall be opened. Jesus said, do you\n\nSpeaker 2: believe that you can walk? Yes, sir. Yes. Yes. Pick up your mat. Pick up your mat\n\nSpeaker 1: and walk. And walk.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow. All right, Bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you. This is my second\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription. I used the first one. And matter of fact, to be honest, I took two\n\nSpeaker 1: of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so take this and believe in your heart that it's covered and\n\nSpeaker 1: sealed by the blood. You're talking to real Americans, Bud. And we believe, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this is the stuff we don't play here. You know, you're not calling Venezuela.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we all believers here, brother. So know that we're here with you and we're\n\nSpeaker 2: alignment with you and this shall come to pass. All right? It will come to pass.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're above and not beneath. You're the head and not the tail, brother. All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. All right? Can I say something quickly before you go?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing is just happenstance. This was a divine setup. This was a divine plan and\n\nSpeaker 1: purpose. You know, even though it came through this medicine here, but God\n\nSpeaker 2: ordained this thing for you and I to be able to meet and give glory to God. There\n\nSpeaker 1: are two or more gathered here in the midst of me. So God be the glory. I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I receive that. Thank you very much. I receive it, brother. And I thank you because he\n\nSpeaker 1: says, let your light so shine with your good works with the glory of the Father\n\nSpeaker 2: in heaven. Right? With your good works.\n\nSpeaker 1: With your good works. It's not his. All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right. Thank you very much, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you bet, brother. You enjoy. You're gonna love it. All right, brother?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for praying upon me. I receive it. I receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Have a good day. Take care. Be well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud. Adios.",
