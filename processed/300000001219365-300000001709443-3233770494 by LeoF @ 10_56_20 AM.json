    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I have some concerns about the order I just placed. So I've been talking to or chatting to the doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm not getting a clear answer. So my question was on the thing is that\n\nSpeaker 2: it says\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra AGV. Okay, from your site it says this is the new improved version.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because it's the original, it's based off the original one.\n\nSpeaker 1: The doctor replied back saying, well, you're using a generic because I have a previous,\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a couple of different prescriptions. One's a generic, but I also have an original prescription from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's the original pill. So I asked him what's the difference between the original blue pill from Pfizer versus your Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: And now there's no response.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm asking you, what is the difference? Because from all the readings that I'm doing now, they're identical. There's no difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so they don't even get into that, the doctors with the patients. They really just go over the medical questions. So what it is, Mr.\n\nSpeaker 1: Saltos, that's the newest pill, the authenticated generic Viagra. That's what AGV stands for. It is a generic version of the medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just the newest version of that pill from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's said to work in as little as 11 minutes, and it lasts longer in your system versus like your regular branded blue pill from Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 2: that's been around forever. It's going to last anywhere from four to six hours,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it can take up to from 60 to 90 minutes to work. Not to say that this pill, this new one can't take 30 minutes to\n\nSpeaker 2: work, but a lot of guys are seeing results much faster, and it is lasting the longer in the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but what makes it different from the original one? I mean, it looks like it has the same exact ingredients.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, there's like small additives. I wouldn't be familiar with the entire scientific process, you know, like I couldn't speak on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just tell us that there's like new additives that go into it that just act, help it to absorb into the system faster and\n\nSpeaker 2: stay in it longer as well, but I wouldn't be a hundred percent familiar with the process and the way that that does work like scientifically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, does this new AGV have the,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you know, have the\n\nSpeaker 1: ingredient for helping arousal?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's not this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I wouldn't know, what would the ingredient be named? If you had knew the name, I might know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's what I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I wouldn't know, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I know like all the other pills have this new ingredient, and that's what's pushing them to sell better.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I read somewhere that it does have this, but I can't find it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure it was like a new thing\n\nSpeaker 1: that was like kind of, kind of like a, you know, catching fire or what have you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it was in the pill, I'm sure our team would advertise it if it's like a popular big new thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could say that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give it a try, but let's talk about the billing and prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I wanted to do this refill as needed. So there's nowhere to,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, manually\n\nSpeaker 1: reorder. It doesn't give me that thing. It just does an auto,\n\nSpeaker 2: auto purchase, and I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I can do for you, Mr. Saltos, is I can pause this account for you for up to three, four, five, six months into the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted, you can always call us back before then to get a refill or to halt the prescription or whatever else you may need.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't like allow me to just cancel it out without cancelling the prescription outright.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see. Okay, so it's not, it's more of a pause on your end,\n\nSpeaker 1: but wouldn't there be a pause on the portal that I can pause prescriptions or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't see that on your page, Mr. Saltos,\n\nSpeaker 1: I will reach out to my administration team and have them refresh that in the next like hour.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll see that change appear on your page as well. So where you can kind of make those changes as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll go ahead and when this calls over, I'll reach out to them and I'll have them,\n\nSpeaker 2: so make it so you can make the changes as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, because I mean, I don't go through 25 pills, 100 milligrams in one month.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's usually lasting two months or a month and a half or whatever it takes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want to be able to reorder on demand, you know, and then without an auto,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, billing and prescriptions and have over quantity.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, I'll fix that for you, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't want to have to cancel it either and have to reopen it and it's a mess.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're able to get on the portal and log in and all that good stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I see change auto shipment and then change prescription choice,\n\nSpeaker 2: choice of dosage, frequency and type.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's there, but it has no option to pause or stop it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go into it with the administration team and I'll have them unlock that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you will be able to make those changes.\n\nSpeaker 2: As of now, the next date set for March.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want me to leave that? It's March 27th, end of March.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or do you want me to push that a little further for you until you're able to make those changes yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: March. Well, what's the date?\n\nSpeaker 2: 27th of March.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's definitely not going to yeah, I'm not going to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can push that to April.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do April 27th or pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is a pause, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you need any more changes, you can always reach out to us before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I will, Mr. Saltos, have the administration team go in and then you'll be able to make those changes on your end as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said like in the next hour, that's a great idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now, on the April 27th, if I don't call back, it will auto-renew, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: It will, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you need to make any changes before then, give us a shout.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I need another month to hold up, you know, so I can...\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll mark that down.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what was your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Leo.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can ask for me if you'd like when you're done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and close this.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what was your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Leo.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can ask for me if you'd like when you call.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do have an extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 0032.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0032, Leo.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you understand the situation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, explain the whole situation to someone every single time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got notes here on your profile and everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and check it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, when you're all set, come on out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got it.",
