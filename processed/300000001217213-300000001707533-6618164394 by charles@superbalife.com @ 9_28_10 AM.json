    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, hi. Hold on, I'm in the car. You're good. I talked to somebody on 12-13 about\n\nSpeaker 2: getting a refund and stopping all future subscription. Okay, I have Alvin Reimer in Delray Beach,\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, correct. Okay, I have here, the only note that I have, I'm not sure if you talked\n\nSpeaker 2: to either Christy or Erica, but it looks like all we did was email you over the tracking\n\nSpeaker 1: number, so did you request the cancellation? Yeah, and a refund. And a refund? Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send it back. I don't know if you guys can take back subscription items. Yeah, we\n\nSpeaker 1: can. I was going to ask, did you already send it back or do you still have everything? No,\n\nSpeaker 2: I still have everything because nobody gave me an RA. Gotcha. Okay, so the RA is on the\n\nSpeaker 1: pill bottles. It's a GoGoMed Southgate, Kentucky address. Whenever you can, shoot everything\n\nSpeaker 2: back over to them, and as soon as they have everything, they will issue the refund. Just\n\nSpeaker 1: out of curiosity, Alvin, was there an issue with the pills or anything like that? No,\n\nSpeaker 2: it does not work for me. It didn't work? Okay, then they didn't even give you a refund? No,\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought it might, but I'm old. I'm going to be 87. Okay, I mean, I got 90-year-olds\n\nSpeaker 2: on this stuff, man, so I mean, if you're still looking for something to give you the\n\nSpeaker 1: kick that you're looking for, I got you. If you're still looking for something to give\n\nSpeaker 2: you the kick, Alvin, we are with Pfizer, so we have other products. We have another variation\n\nSpeaker 1: of the Viagra AGV. If you're interested in it, I can send you that version. It's made\n\nSpeaker 2: in France. It's FDA approved. I can send it to you as a sample for free just so that we\n\nSpeaker 1: can see if anything can give you that kick that you're looking for and leave no stone\n\nSpeaker 2: unturned with us. I can send you 10 free pills of the AGV that's made in France. I\n\nSpeaker 1: guarantee you're going to be calling back for refills, so I can send that out today\n\nSpeaker 2: if you'd like. Okay, that's fine. I'll try anything. Okay, sounds good. Let's do this\n\nSpeaker 1: then. Just send back the one from January. I'll send this as a replacement for the one\n\nSpeaker 2: from December, and then just keep us in the loop on when you do need them next time, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what address do I send it back to? It is 525 Alexandria Pike, P-I-K-E, in South\n\nSpeaker 2: Bay, Kentucky. Hold on. 525, go ahead. Alexandria Pike, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-R-I-A, and then Pike.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on. Pike, P-I-K-E. R-I, hold on, I'm in the car. You're good. Alexandria, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-R-I-A.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. And then Pike, P-I-K-E. Okay. And then South Gate, S, South, and then Gate, one\n\nSpeaker 1: word. And then K-Y, Kentucky, 41071. 41071. Hold on. Okay, South Gate, Kentucky, and zip\n\nSpeaker 2: code again, I'm sorry? 41071. Got it. Okay. All right. All right, sounds good. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have my address down, okay. Yeah, correct. 1255 Southwest 4th Avenue in Delray Beach,\n\nSpeaker 2: Florida. I got you. Make sure that the initials after Reamer is X-E-I-K-X-X. Yes, sir. That's\n\nSpeaker 1: exactly what I have. Okay, because it's a delivery service. They won't take anything\n\nSpeaker 2: other than that. Oh, understood. Understood. I'll make sure that that is in the notes as\n\nSpeaker 1: well. And then the Viagra A-G-V that I'm sending, it will have the number 100 pressed into them.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you're able to tell the difference between the two pills, okay? Okay. Thank you\n\nSpeaker 1: so much. I really appreciate it. Yeah, absolutely. Hope you have a great day, all right? You\n\nSpeaker 2: too. Thanks. Appreciate it. Bye-bye.",
