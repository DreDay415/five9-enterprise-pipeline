    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I didn't realize that when I ordered this stuff for my husband that it was auto-ship,\n\nSpeaker 1: a resale.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they sent an auto-ship, I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem, I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just confirm Robert's date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, July 28th, 1957.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: How's the medication working out for him?\n\nSpeaker 1: Doesn't really work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I was asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you happen to have them on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I have him here?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got a refill, I didn't realize I was doing auto-fills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Quantity 10 puts you on automatic refills on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I just want to see, can you tell me what's imprinted on the individual pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: On the individual pill, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I have a feeling they just sent you regular generics and you did not receive the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Challenging my eye here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to know if it says AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, let me get a closer look.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can take your iPhone, take a picture of it, and then zoom in on that picture.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does say AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: They sent you just regular generic Viagras, those are not the AGBs.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second, I'm going to get you out a replacement of the correct medication,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry, I just spilled them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay, just throw them in the trash anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to send you 25 instead of 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so when you get this, okay, the pharmacy is going to mail this out to you tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this new bottle in the mail, it's going to say AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's also going to say Greenstone on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: And Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted on the pill is 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: because your bottle right now says APCO and you already confirmed they're generic\n\nSpeaker 2: because they say AC.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to have them automatically.\n\nSpeaker 1: A lot of people just like to go ahead and pause it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I cancel you out completely right now, it would delete your profile,\n\nSpeaker 2: so the pharmacy would not be able to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause you until July 31, 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll give you my extension so you can call me back\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how they work out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, you can cancel out from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just to clarify, these are 20s and you're going to send me 100s?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, those are 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: You paid for 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And is that a higher dosage or can you take more of these?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like instead of one, can you take two?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, okay, so no.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do not want to exceed more than 100 milligrams within 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the AGB is way stronger than the generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just had a guy call in.\n\nSpeaker 2: He was so sweet.\n\nSpeaker 1: He actually disputed it with his bank, and he called me back and said they worked\n\nSpeaker 2: and he wanted to pay me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was like, oh, you're so sweet.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was like, that was so adorable.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, you'll have better luck with the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll give you my extension and my name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And are we going to be charged for these now?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, because you received the incorrect medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this will be the more?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is generic and we're going to get more of a pure one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the Pfizer's latest formula of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they switched around the inactive ingredients.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the best way to describe it is if you had two cups of water and you put the\n\nSpeaker 2: generic in a cup of water, it's going to dissolve in 30 seconds.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you put the AGB in a cup of water, it's going to dissolve in two to three\n\nSpeaker 2: minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that means when they swallow it, it allows it more time to get down to their\n\nSpeaker 2: member to work more efficiently.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And less headaches, less everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to send that to me, I'll try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Otherwise, because I didn't know it and all of a sudden I've got to charge\n\nSpeaker 1: another thing and we've only used one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: They told people.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you receive the incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So sometimes the pharmacy does that when they run out and they don't tell us and\n\nSpeaker 1: it creates a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I got you the correct stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
