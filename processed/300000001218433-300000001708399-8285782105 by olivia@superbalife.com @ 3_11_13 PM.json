How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm okay. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Robert?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would really like to cancel because I've never received but two months of the core blue, and they've been taking it out for four or five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with this. Okay. Robert, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: July 11, 1955.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. And you're located at 3428 Mintic Way?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nebo, North Carolina. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so this refill from today, you do not need it. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they've been taking it out of my bank account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to receive it, then, of course, that's great. You can do that. All right. So, you said you didn't receive the last order. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I got it about a month ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, then, yeah, you did receive it. So, you should have received with us. It looks like there would have been three orders you should have received with us so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, that's good. Yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option with the prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that works is whenever you do want to order, if it is before then, you can. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's just put it on hold, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. So, yeah, if you need anything before July 27th of this year, just give us a call. We're always here Monday through Friday, eight spots specific.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.",
