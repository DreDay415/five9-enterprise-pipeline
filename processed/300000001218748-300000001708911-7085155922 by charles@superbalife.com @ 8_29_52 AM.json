    "text": "Speaker 1: Good morning Charles, my name is Michael Delane, I put in a cancellation like about a month\n\nSpeaker 2: and a half ago, but I guess they didn't cancel me out and they sent out, I guess they reordered\n\nSpeaker 1: again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I got you, North Aurora, Illinois?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got you, okay, you emailed us, you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got you, okay, it's always best to call in and do any type of cancellation, brother,\n\nSpeaker 1: because what happens is a lot of dudes' wives will try to cancel on their behalf, come to\n\nSpeaker 2: find out the guy never wants to cancel, and then it becomes a whole thing, so we always\n\nSpeaker 1: have people call in and do everything over the phone with one of us agents.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have really, really great customer service here, so as far as this situation, this one\n\nSpeaker 1: is on its way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can't do anything to stop it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll cancel everything going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: It actually says it'll be there today between 11.30 and 2.30, so when you get it, if you\n\nSpeaker 1: want to keep it, great, I'll make sure that this is the last one going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm assuming you're way overstocked, and then if you don't want it, all you need to do is\n\nSpeaker 1: write return to sender on it with a marker or a pen and put it back in the mailbox and\n\nSpeaker 2: the mailman will take it next time they swing by and send it right back to us for free and\n\nSpeaker 1: you'll get the money back after that, so whichever, however you want to play it, totally\n\nSpeaker 2: up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, thanks a lot, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: If anything else is needed, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just out of curiosity, I mean, how were you doing on the first two batches that were sent?\n\nSpeaker 1: It just seemed like it just didn't work at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you take these pills, you take them on an empty stomach and no alcohol, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes I might eat a little something, but I'm taking them on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've tried it on an empty stomach, it's like nothing, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So real fast, Michael, I don't want to sell you anything, but we are with Pfizer, so it's\n\nSpeaker 2: always very disappointing when our product isn't taking its full effect on somebody.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you're still interested in seeing if there is anything that we can offer you to\n\nSpeaker 2: give you that kick that you're looking for down there, then I can send you a sample of\n\nSpeaker 1: something completely different.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's another version of the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I'm not going to sell it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send it to you completely as a sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you like this version better, call me back at 0040.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: We won't have to wait in a queue anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then we can talk about-\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me write that down.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0040.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0040.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I won't send you as many pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll only send you 10, just because we obviously just want to make sure that these give you\n\nSpeaker 2: that kick that you're looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll send you a sample.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: When they do call, they want you to send a face-up repor-\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: When they do give me a call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guarantee these ones are going to fit the bill for you because they're made in our France\n\nSpeaker 1: factory from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we'll talk about future accommodations with this one rather than the ones that you've\n\nSpeaker 1: been getting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me, what's the difference between the two?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: So one is made in America.\n\nSpeaker 1: One is made in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a couple made in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the one that I'm sending you is a lot more potent, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Anybody that I honestly send it to, they honestly call back within a couple of weeks\n\nSpeaker 1: asking for refills, but obviously it's month-to-month, so they have to wait a couple weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: But either way, this one has a lot more potency.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you're looking for on the pill to identify it is a number 100 pressed onto it like a\n\nSpeaker 2: stamp.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you'll be able to tell the difference between the two, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send that out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd expect them-\n\nSpeaker 2: Is the weather pending, brother?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send it out maybe Monday or Tuesday, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks a lot, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
