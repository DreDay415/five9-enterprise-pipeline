    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. First of all, I need to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I went online, and I was trying to get the newest Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And once I put my information, my debit card number,\n\nSpeaker 1: it automatically charged me for a prescription I used to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't know how to stop it or anything,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you guys charged me $113 for a prescription that I did not want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Let's get this fixed for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we can get this fixed for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to make sure you – yeah, so you wanted the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did not want the previous prescription of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you want me to cancel the previous and get you the proper medication, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I wanted a one-time deal. I didn't want a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't know how to just get – excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 2: These are prescriptions, especially AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when a doctor writes it for you, it will come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't normally recommend canceling right away because the doctors don't like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because hypothetically, if you get that first prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you like it, and you cancel it before you want a refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: they won't write you another prescription, at least through Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because they'd rather not have a patient do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can pause it where you won't have reoccurring shipments until you want one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no, I don't even – because I got five prescriptions\n\nSpeaker 2: that I haven't used for one pill out of the five prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: And once I realized – that's why I canceled prescription at first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I apologize to cut you off,\n\nSpeaker 2: but this would be a lot easier if I could look up your account\n\nSpeaker 1: and make adjustments and see what we're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael Carter, birthday 9-4-65, 1965.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Mr. Carter, I'm looking at your script right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was written back in July.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this was for a quantity of 25 of the 50-milligram Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor had written it with five monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did see one went through on the 27th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what I'm going to do right now – because you mentioned you don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to attempt to cancel it with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to reach out to the pharmacy right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once they confirm cancellation on this most recent one,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be able to issue a refund of the $113.95, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or what I can do for you is switch that over to the AGV like you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that the newest one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I could get you – because of this inconvenience,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could get you 25 100-milligram Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I can honor that price of the $113.95 that you paid for the generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: After that, I want to pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, what we can do is we can then pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So then that gives you time to try the new medication, see how you like it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can let us know how you want to proceed.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the thing about it on that pause, once I realize I want it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to have to give you another card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'm going to have to get another card because I canceled my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I can't afford to keep getting charged for something I don't want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you don't need – yeah, you can always call us\n\nSpeaker 1: and add that information later down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bear with me right here where I'm going to adjust these prescriptions really fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I went ahead and made those adjustments, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I canceled the incorrect order, replaced that with the proper medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm honoring your previous price of what you paid for of the $113.95,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I am going to put your account on that pause, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So is this the one that it works in 15 minutes?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm right here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just making notes under the account for the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Michael.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's been done and completed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything else I can help you with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a lovely rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Feel free to give us a call back in the future with any questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
