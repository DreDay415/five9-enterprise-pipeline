My name is Ruben Munoz, last name is M-U-N-O-Z, and I just got an order in yesterday of Cyndamifil, which is generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, how do I stop these from coming? Because I got an order recently sent to me,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I thought I had contacted them and told them to stop sending them, and I just got one in the mail yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can look into that for you. So what is the phone number that's going to be associated with your prescription for me to look into?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's 818-370-1742.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, there you are, Ruben. And what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-31-1958.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located in Montrose, California?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Yeah, so I do see you here. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just how do I stop having you send me anymore?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option with your prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the way that would work is if you did want to order within the next six months or before July 28th of this year, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But I don't need any more sent out to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, no, I completely understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, if you, you know, do want to keep access to the script, you do have that option that if you just leave it on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you do want to call back and order with it, you can, as opposed to having to restart it and having to pay a separate –\n\nSpeaker 2: we have a new policy that you'd have to pay a separate doctor fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So put it on hold, and I will contact you when I need some more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Yeah. Well, thank you so much, Ruben.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day, and if you need anything before the end of July, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
