    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Olivia. My name is Peter Kavickia, and I'm calling in reference to a prescription number if you need that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I can see you. Can you just confirm your date of birth for me, Peter?\n\nSpeaker 2: August 1st, 1944.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. And your address?\n\nSpeaker 2: 188 Barbados Drive, Jupiter, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, Peter. Yes, so I see you. Yeah, so how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I wrote an email the other day wanting this prescription to be canceled. I only ordered it for one bottle to try it out, and I got another one in the mail yesterday. So I don't want to be on any repeat subscriptions, and that's not what I signed up for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option with the prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it. And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then, so that would be July 27th, you could. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can't just automatically cancel the whole thing?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, of course, that's an option if the pills don't work for you. It's just we only pay the doctor's fee once. So when you do all of the work, right, to sign up for the prescription, we pay the doctor to see you since obviously they do charge for that and to start the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And because we do offer the option to place the prescription on hold, that's the reason why we only pay for that doctor's fee once. But, I mean, if the pills didn't work for you, then, of course, you wouldn't need...\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need them because they're acting against all the medications I have, the advice of my doctor, so I have to stop them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see. Okay. All right. Okay, well, your prescription is canceled and you know where to find us. If you ever do get in shape or off of any other competing medications, we'd love to have you back to try our newest product. It's really good stuff and it is a superior prescription to your current one. We are offering free samples of it right now, but only to people who, like, it's safe for them to take it, which I guess isn't you. But anyway, I hope you have a great day, Peter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I have another question. I have another question. Why wasn't I sent the superior one in the beginning?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, so that's just not the prescription number I see for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Just wondering. Okay, dear. So I'm done now. Do I owe anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. You have a wonderful day. Thank you for your help. You've been most kind.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I hope you have a great day. Thanks.",
