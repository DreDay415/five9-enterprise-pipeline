    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Vagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, hello, we do insert good good. Thank you for asking. Let me pull your prescription real quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Moses?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you have a prescription for the—\n\nSpeaker 1: 100-milligram, I think 10 tablets, and I think Dr. Anthony that roadie. We've—\n\nSpeaker 2: Refilled every 30 days. How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I try to cancel that and—\n\nSpeaker 2: It took it out of my account anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any health concern or you just try to order as needed? You don't like the initial writing from the doctor?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just want to call and reorder as needed because you're not required to get it every month. That's just all the doctor wrote initially.\n\nSpeaker 1: Assuming that you're active because you've got 10 pills, but if you don't need that, I can advise the pharmacy to pause the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think they pause. You have to offer you which lock your price in and you call to reorder as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you're not on the 30 days, the 30-day supply anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but it took it out of my account. I didn't want—I want to need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, we can—I can reverse that for you here, okay, and he's gonna be as needed, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: 639 if I should be a refund because we'll just process today because the doctor, like I said, wrote it with refill assuming that you're—\n\nSpeaker 2: Active because that's what 95% of the patients are here and you just order 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I did is I refunded you six sixty-three ninety-five. You wasn't ready and paused the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: They pause it up to after a year and then you're not on a monthly anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call to reorder and the caveat is that if you get just a minimum of two refills a year—\n\nSpeaker 2: You're always able to claim the current market price that you have even though new people, new patients, gonna pay more.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can claim that if you maintain a minimum of two refills a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Okay, so but everything is paused right now, okay? You're not on—\n\nSpeaker 1: Every 30 days anymore, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Refund my money.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did already, just wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: We say five to ten business days to be safe, but based on your bank—\n\nSpeaker 2: It could be sooner because it was just processed today. So you probably gonna get it sooner than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is not to consolidate in charge. I don't think so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir. Thank you. So you all said bye-bye.",
