    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm trying to figure out why you guys sent a second order to my house when I took a first order as a trial error.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me pull up your account and see how the doctor wrote your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: First name is David, last name is Williams. Date of birth, April 1st, 1955.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I see here the prescription was for the 100 mg Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, it looks like the doctor wrote it with refills, so that's why it went through the following month,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it is not a subscription. You're not required to do it this way.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted, you could just pause it, and you could call in and place future orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want future orders. I want to go there. I just want to do it for the first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I made it clear that it was a trial error. I don't want them charging my account and charging somebody more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, this is an FDA-approved medication that's written by a doctor, so it's a prescription with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we can't ever do trials. There are optional refills for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to close out the prescription altogether, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's very easy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are they charging my account for the second prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yes, sir, it was charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, see, I didn't want that. That's why I made it clear when I first did it. It's going to be a one-time trial for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I was told.\n\nSpeaker 2: Normally, if you do it over the phone and say it's a one-time trial, they put a pause on it, but I don't have any notes here for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That being said, if you want to return it, sir, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just put return to sender on that package, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you put it right on the label there and put it right back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once that's returned and filed, you'll be issued a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I want to stop, please. This continues.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, of course. So upon cancellation, this prescription is officially closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any future prescriptions will be limited and with doctor permission and approval.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you accept these terms? So when this is closed out, you won't be able to order this ever again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to be able to close it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I was just ready to do it as a trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Okay, you're all set, Mr. Williams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And who am I speaking with so I know when I'm going to contact you?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick, okay. So it will be stopped as of today, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: As of today, it is closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what did they charge me for this second order?\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95, the same amount as the last time, so with your special.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I just want to stop, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, yeah. This prescription is closed out. You won't have access to these refills anymore. It's closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
