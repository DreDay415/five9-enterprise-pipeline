    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jimmy. Can you hear me okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you just fine. How about you? Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can, yeah. I just got to turn the volume up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got lazy while I was on hold, but I didn't fall asleep at least.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that. We've been busy with these new orders of the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. No, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Look, I ordered it. I wanted to try it, but it looks like somehow I may have, by mistake,\n\nSpeaker 1: got on an automatic refill, and I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'm older. I'm not jumping in and out of bed every day, so I don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you sent me one, and you sent me one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry for the delay, by the way. That's why we're talking over each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's my phone service. I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I got one, and then about a month later, I got another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So can you get me off that automatic refill, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me take a look at your account here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure I'll order it again, but I just, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's not the frequency that I need to have it every month like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you taken care of. Let me see what I can do for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: First of all, let me ask you, how is that Viagra 50 milligrams working for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you got a chance to try it yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. I'm going to, and I'm sure it'll work fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I do see your prescription where they have you on the 50, 10,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you say that every month is too often.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can pause that and postpone that so you're not getting that every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: What works for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you have to have some type of prescription on file,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the good thing about the thing is you can always call and postpone\n\nSpeaker 2: and push it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can set up so you're getting it like every four or five months\n\nSpeaker 2: rather than every month if that's not too frequent for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Jimmy, I prefer just an as-call, you know, as-will-call basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, unfortunately, because it is a prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: it has to have some type of prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can set it up so when you can call, you can say push me back another three\n\nSpeaker 1: or four months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've still got two or three left.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want any right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that will keep your prescription active and keep that locked-in price\n\nSpeaker 1: that you're getting because I know the tails are going to kick in\n\nSpeaker 2: and our pills come from the Pfizer labs in France,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going to go up like three times as much almost when that kicks,\n\nSpeaker 2: but your price remains the same because you are on a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can push that out to you for you like twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's like five or six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if it comes too soon for you, you don't even have to get it then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just call us and say, hey, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Push me back another three or four months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not ready yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: That keeps your prescription active and locked-in,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that allows you to order whenever you want because you can order anytime\n\nSpeaker 1: before then too as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So can I go ahead and do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll push that out for like six months so you're not getting them so often.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll give you the exact date as a matter of fact.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if it's coming too soon for you, you can just call and say, hey,\n\nSpeaker 2: push me back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not ready for them for another few months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or between then if you want to call and order,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can because your prescription will still be on file and still active.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much did it cost me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't even remember.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is the 10 pills cost?\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 pills for a total of $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do know they're going to go up to almost like close to $200 once the\n\nSpeaker 1: tariffs kick in.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you'll be locked in at that price because you are on a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, can I just push it out to like six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: And it will not be every month after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will be every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So therefore they're not coming every month to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the next one will kick out like July the 13th.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if that's too soon, just give us a call and say, hey, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Push me back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not ready for them yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you want some in May, you can just call and order some in May,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that will push you back for another six months as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that will give you more than enough time to try to get caught up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only option I have other than canceling completely\n\nSpeaker 2: and then getting hit with tariff increases\n\nSpeaker 1: and having to go through the whole application again, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you already have your prescription on file with the doctors\n\nSpeaker 2: and pharmacies that we paid for for free for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can tell you, when the tariffs begin,\n\nSpeaker 2: those are going to start being costly too,\n\nSpeaker 1: especially because of the product that we're selling, everybody's trying to get.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're the only FDA-approved Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's why unfortunately the hold is so long because everybody's trying to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: People understand what's happening,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're trying to make sure that they get in before it's too late.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's what's going on right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can't make it every six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's only ten, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I can call if I haven't used them up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when's the next one coming, July 13th?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a July 13th.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, for a bonus for you because I see you're a VIP\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm changing to elite,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you out ten additional bonus bills for you because, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: again, we're doing this for our VIP clients.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to do you a justice.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want you to try the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I also have another bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent me another bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I told you that in the beginning.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't really need anything else.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did postpone it for, like, six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it would be six months after that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can always call before then to push it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: That keeps your subscription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then that's all logged in.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got me noted for that, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I won't get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 69 a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess that's what we can do for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Doug.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll mark it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
