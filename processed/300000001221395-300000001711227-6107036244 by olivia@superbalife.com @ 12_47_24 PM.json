    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Joel Melendez.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Joel. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm calling because I'd like to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this. Okay. Joel, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-4-77.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 1466 Black Forest Drive, Allentown, Pennsylvania, 18104?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you did want to order before then you could, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself before that period.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Yeah, so if you need anything before six months from now, it's July 28th, if you need anything before then, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific, and otherwise your prescription is on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
