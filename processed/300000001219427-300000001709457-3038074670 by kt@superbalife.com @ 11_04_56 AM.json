I'm going to read off what's on your chart, Myles, and then just correct me if I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: wrong, bud, so I can help you put a stop to this, all right, bud? I just need you to verify some\n\nSpeaker 2: things, bud. All right, I'll take care of you. Okay. So when I see, so just here, I'm going to\n\nSpeaker 1: read what's on your chart and just correct me if I'm wrong. So you are working with Dr. Aaron\n\nSpeaker 2: Myers. He's one of our Pfizer doctors, and it looks like since 2023, this guy set you up\n\nSpeaker 1: with a VIP status, and then he also wrote a script for the generic 100 milligrams of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's the white, and then he basically ordered the pharmacy to send you results on his behalf.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want me to put a stop to that, so you're not getting it, and you can get it on your own\n\nSpeaker 2: when you want? Yes, that's the first thing I need. That's great. Okay. Let me put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 1: this, bud, and I'll set it up where you can just click a button and get it whenever you want. And\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, by the way, we're here in LA, and I just moved here from LA to San Diego, bud,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I miss you guys, man. Yeah, man, I was living in Bankers Hill, man, and I miss,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, I miss, man, I miss you guys. Even Escobedo, man, so fucking nice up there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you'll have to keep coming down here when you have the time to get away and come down here\n\nSpeaker 2: and chill, you know? Yeah, dude, and you know what, man, the thing is the weather. When I did\n\nSpeaker 1: a side-by-side on ChatGPT and like, you know, on Grok. Okay. Quality of life, air quality,\n\nSpeaker 2: population, you know, there's a difference between, San Diego has vibration, LA has static\n\nSpeaker 1: energy. You know what I mean? Interesting, yeah. I call it noise, yeah, but that would be-\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, a lot of noise. Let me put you on a brief hold, bud, and I'll definitely take care. And,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, I'll give you my extension, so if you need anything stronger or anything at all,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can always do a switch up for anything, you know? Let me know, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me put you on a brief hold. All right, bud? One moment.",
