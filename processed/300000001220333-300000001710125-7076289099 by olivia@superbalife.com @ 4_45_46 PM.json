I'm sorry, but there's a delay and I'm talking to you on my card speaker.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm taking you off of that and putting you on my phone so you don't have the delay.\n\nSpeaker 2: There you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I can probably hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I can hear you better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. So the thing is I've updated your order to get the Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I mentioned, you were already approved by our doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is an extensive process that goes into ordering this that you did go through\n\nSpeaker 2: and you did fill out an extensive and overwhelming amount of information about yourself\n\nSpeaker 1: and you did receive notifications that the order was placed and that the doctor approved it\n\nSpeaker 2: and that this is how you take it, X, Y, Z. We are the only sellers of the AGV\n\nSpeaker 1: in the United States and we paid a lot of money through Pfizer directly to be able to say\n\nSpeaker 2: that because it is accurate information.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did select to order 10 pills and then to add on the extremely generous offer of 10 more\n\nSpeaker 2: for $29 of FDA approved real Viagra through Pfizer in France themselves.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Pfizer lab, the creator, I don't know if you are aware, but we are the creator of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: We only sell FDA approved, third party tested real stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is the order you placed and then on top of that, the third screen that popped up\n\nSpeaker 2: which you clicked on asked you if you wanted to try our all natural supplement\n\nSpeaker 1: for healthy blood flow and natural testosterone production which is called,\n\nSpeaker 2: that product is called Test Strict Dream and it's 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you selected the three bottle option which is why there is a third charge\n\nSpeaker 2: on your credit card for $79.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now if you don't want the Test Strict Dream, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I can help you take care of that if that is in the order that you placed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be great if we could take that off.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd be happy with what I have for the other items.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so give me one moment to process your refund for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I wouldn't want to, this is what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm pretty sure I knew what I clicked but the $79 one was the one I was concerned\n\nSpeaker 2: about because I wasn't sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you could remove that, that would be excellent\n\nSpeaker 2: because I would still like to try your product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let's go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because there's weirdly a very specific way to cancel the Test Strict Dream and only that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the Dave.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good bye next year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me just one.",
