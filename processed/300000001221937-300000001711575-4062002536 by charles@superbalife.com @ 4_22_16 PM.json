How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not too bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm calling to cancel my subscription with ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Richard Klack in Fort Benton, Montana?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Alright. Looks like you're a VIP member here, Richard.\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you not a fan of the pills or what happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just haven't even used them all yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. I can pause everything from now until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you've got some more time to use what you've got and then give us a call and let us know if you need it earlier.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I haven't even tried them out yet, honestly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather just cancel the subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Alright. Everything's canceled. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Thanks.",
