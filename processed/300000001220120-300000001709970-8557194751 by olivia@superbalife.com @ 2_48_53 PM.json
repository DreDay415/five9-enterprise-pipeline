    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viacra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Olivia, hope you're having a good afternoon.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Dave McDonough.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Dave, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, I tried your product and it did not work for me, so I was looking for two things.\n\nSpeaker 2: One, to cancel any future mailings, and two, hopefully to get my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I can help you with both.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what is the phone number associated with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: if it's not this one that you just called in on?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it is this one right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was transferred, so I don't know what it shows up on your phone, on your screen,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'm 772-579-7813.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, there you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what's your date of birth, David?\n\nSpeaker 1: 8547.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like you ask nice, easy questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep them coming.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay, and you're located at 5049 North Highway, A1A, Apartment 1305, Fort Pierce, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so I do see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am sorry to hear that the pills didn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry as I am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you do, of course, have the option to send them back for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can e-mail you the instructions for how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do have 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the e-mail we have on file is DSNDavidMcDon, kind of like your first name,\n\nSpeaker 2: your second name, sorry, 1040 at AOL.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the e-mail I'm going to send you, it's going to say return and refund instructions,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm working on it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do I get money for the ones I've already used that didn't work\n\nSpeaker 1: or just the ones that weren't used?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to get a refund for everything if I could.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, it didn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish it worked, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, you do have that option, of course,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it is my job to mention to you that you also have the option if, say,\n\nSpeaker 2: you wanted to send back the most recent one,\n\nSpeaker 1: but then I would be happy to send you out a free sample as a replacement of our\n\nSpeaker 2: newest highest quality stuff, which I do think is a superior prescription to yours,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I do think you would have better results with.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it's a free sample and it's better than what I have, what do I have to lose?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that just means, though, that you can send back the most recent one\n\nSpeaker 1: or the two most recent ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just can't send them all back if I'm sending you the free sample just because\n\nSpeaker 1: the free sample has to be a replacement for at least one of those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, kind of, but I thought a few of these are better than the other ones?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and then if they aren't, so the way it's going to work is I'm going to send\n\nSpeaker 1: them out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be 10 pills, and then I'm going to place the prescription on hold\n\nSpeaker 1: for you until June while you try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Make sure you love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure you prefer it to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't, you can just give us a call before June, but I think you will,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you'll give us a call before June but to place an order,\n\nSpeaker 2: which would be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia, you should be in sales then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a question for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you as beautiful as you sound?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's so sweet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe, yeah, kind of.\n\nSpeaker 1: Kind of.\n\nSpeaker 2: And where am I calling?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you in Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 2: We are actually in Santa Monica, but you're right, we ship out of Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you want to give me the sample, I'll give it a try.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I want it to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: My girlfriend wants it to work, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can I ship this to 5049 North Highway A1A,\n\nSpeaker 1: Apartment 1305, Fort Pierce, Florida, 34949?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to receive these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Typically I would say by the end of the week, but with that crazy, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: winter storm, it could be Saturday or Monday or Tuesday,\n\nSpeaker 1: but usually it would be by the end of the week, so we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, if you need anything before June,\n\nSpeaker 1: just give us a call either way before then and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the best number to reach you at, hun?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's going to be this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're right, you don't have the direct phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, do you have a pen and paper?\n\nSpeaker 1: I sure do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's going to be 800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name's Olivia, and my extension is 0016.\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia, it's been an absolute pleasure, and I hope I made you laugh a little,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I hope this thing works because, you know, I want to have fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, David, well, I hope you have the very best day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, just a reminder, make sure you take these on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you want to avoid alcohol when you take them just because alcohol\n\nSpeaker 2: restricts blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Remember that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you, David.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have the best day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, bye.",
