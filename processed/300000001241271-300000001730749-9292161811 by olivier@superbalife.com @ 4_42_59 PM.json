Mr. Ali?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so I see you have a prescription, like you say, for Viagra, A.G., 300 mg, 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think what happened, doctor all calm, already we've refilled due to the quantity you got.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't need it, I can stop that initial writing from the doctor and pause the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you just order as needed instead, because you're not required to get it every month, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just initial writing. You don't need to go based on that. I can stop that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cancel the 30 days from the initial writing from the doctor, pause the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: they pause you up to half a year, and you can just call to reorder. You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you will cancel it in future, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so I'm canceling the 30 days and pause the prescription, so that will reorder as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: They pause you up to half a year, and then you can get, some patients get to refill once or twice a year, for example.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't understand what you're saying, just stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm saying, I'm going to stop the 30 days, the monthly, for you, because you don't need it every single month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to pause the prescription, so you can call to reorder as needed,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's going to save the prescription, your price is not going to go up,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're just going to call to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright. They pause you up to half a year, to stop the monthly, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when I need it, I will call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm calling you right now, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
