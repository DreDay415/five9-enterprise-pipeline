How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I got a prescription with you guys online.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first couple of months I guess it went okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got like 20 pills per.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last few months I've been only getting 10 pills per month, but the price is still the same?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so basically the first time we ordered this it was $63.95 for 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then for first time customers, for a first time order, we offer to sell you an additional 10 pills for half the price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which is why you ended up with 20, because you paid $63.95 plus $29.40 for 20 pills in total.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's only for your first time purchase that we offer that deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: So all your purchases after would have been $10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. I want to cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra costs $100 for one pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, shoot, I got like the second to the lowest dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like, man, it's not like I'm paying like, and it's a knockoff.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not. That's what I'm telling you. This comes from the Viagra company.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why we charge so much. It's not the cheap stuff that you can get from India and China.\n\nSpeaker 1: From people that are making it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I hear you, but it's not called Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, whatever it is, it's still a knockoff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I still want to just cancel. I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, we'll cancel you out. It seems like the easier thing to do here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sir, we'll cancel you out. You have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you don't even got my information. It's like how hard to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your caller ID, sir, your name is what, Robert Franklin?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you're all canceled, sir. Need anything else?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.",
