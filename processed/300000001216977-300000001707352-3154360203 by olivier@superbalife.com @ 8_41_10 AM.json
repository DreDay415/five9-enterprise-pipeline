    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: How we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing all right. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Mr. Eric Trippani?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Syracuse, New York?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Well, I see you have a prescription from Dr. Tariq for Viagra 50 mg from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you, Mr. Trippani?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was calling to cancel the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any health concern, or you just don't need refill for a while?\n\nSpeaker 1: Send me a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I mean, you can pause and just reorder as needed moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I can advise the pharmacy to stop the monthly moving forward, and you can just reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually, they pause you up to half a year, and then, you know, you can get your refill once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: but not every month or every other month, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I just don't have the need for them at this point, so I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I can advise them to pause, so you can just reorder when you need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tell them that you're not active. Usually, we advise pharmacy based on your need.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you call, you know, if you don't need pill, there is no point to send you pill if you have some pill left.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I can let them know for you, and they just will pause you so you can just reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, that way, you lock your price in, but you don't just receive no refill because you don't need it at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So, let me advise the pharmacy for you, and you can just call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you don't have to get 25. You can get 10. You can get 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you don't necessarily have to get 25 pills every time, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, can you send that in an email that you're just putting it on hold until I'm ready to order? Is that something we can confirm that way?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. They're going to pause you for half a year, and you can just reorder. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you think in the future, you think that 25 is a good quantity for you, or you want to decrease?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure at this point.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not sure? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I have plenty now. I don't need any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had reached out before, like about a month, two months ago, and asked to stop the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I just saw that the process began.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You know, I see. I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I advise the pharmacy to stop, and the account will be paused for half a year. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anything you might need, Mr. Tripani?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Thank you for calling us, and you have a good one. And call us to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I will.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
