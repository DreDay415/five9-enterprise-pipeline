How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I need to cancel an order and any future orders associated with my name please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is your name Craig?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh yeah, I do see you are a VIP here with the circuit and Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you mind if I ask why you're canceling?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I didn't order it. My brother did that as a prank the other night.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then he told me about it after he did it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, you said that you didn't order it?\n\nSpeaker 2: My brother did it as a prank.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's an expensive prank.\n\nSpeaker 2: No joke.\n\nSpeaker 1: He got a kick out of it, let me tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay. Well, as soon as you ship that back to us we can go ahead and give you a refund for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want to make sure there's not any future orders that are going to be coming to my attention either.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you are aware you can order this as needed if you want to, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't need it. I said it was a prank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's hard to...\n\nSpeaker 1: That is a hard one, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, we'll go ahead and take care of it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will I get an email confirmation or something to tell me it's canceled?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. Just a verbal one that your prescription is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's fine. As long as I don't get any more shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you said this other one's already shipped, so I'll send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.",
