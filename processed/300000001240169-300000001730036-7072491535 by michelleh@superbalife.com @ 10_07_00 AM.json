Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Stephen, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-27-1955.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I actually haven't begun yet because I have other medication that I'm trying to get through with.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just don't need it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. So yeah, with your VIP status, you don't have to have your refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause that for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could pause that for you until August 1st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, if you can do that, that would be okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect. Yeah. Yeah, you don't have to have your refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you don't need a refill by August 1st, just give us a call and you can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it also keeps you locked in at your price rate because if prices go up, yours would stay the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's another one that's already been initiated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any way to stop that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's already been shipped. Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's going to be delivered. It's not giving me an exact delivery date.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't need that one, just go ahead and write on the package, return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 1: pop it back in your mailbox, and that way we can issue you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I'll decide that when I get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I appreciate your cooperation. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, not a problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
