How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just received a shipment of the AGB Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it came sooner than I needed it, so I tried to get it into my account\n\nSpeaker 2: and say to hold it off for a couple months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I accidentally hit, I guess, the button where it said to refill it again today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see that, I see that. What was your name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: William Stevenson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't think that's gone out or anything, Mr. Stevenson.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're in Cincinnati, right? 45248?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I should be able to, you wanted to cancel it, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel it. And then how do I cancel for a month or two?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it doesn't give you the ability to do that, I don't think, on the site.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you know what? I'll go talk to my administration team to see if they can fix that issue for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a glitch that some people have been experiencing.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I'll do for you is I'll push it manually right now\n\nSpeaker 1: and then have them go in there and fix that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And next time you log on, you should see that as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: How far out did you want that next order? March, April?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, April.\n\nSpeaker 1: April? Okay, no problem. So that'll be end of April.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll reach out to my admin team to see if we can fix that glitch for you, Mr. Stevenson.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I canceled today's order, refunded, pushed the next order to April, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
