    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi Charles, actually I'm calling because I tried to make an adjustment on my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yesterday and it ended up sending me the fricking pills and stuff that I don't really need right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I wanted to see if I could cancel that and then maybe, what I was trying to do is\n\nSpeaker 2: I was trying to delay it for like 30 plus days or whatever, you know, like the recurring thing or whatnot, but it didn't seem to be working on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just thought, well, maybe the next time it comes around it'll send me just 10 pills and I should be good to go, but I see that it's discharging and I just got pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I was trying to do is I was trying to delay that out like 60 days before it sends anything else because I just had a big shipment sent to me and what's weird is, like, I was\n\nSpeaker 1: trying to do the Viagra AGV, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm kind of new to all this stuff and the first time they sent them, they seemed\n\nSpeaker 1: to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the second time they sent them, they had a different number on there, like a generic one that said like, I can't remember what they said on, like AB something, it said like two letters.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, AC, yeah, that's the American made AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, the ones that you should be getting now should have the number 100 pressed onto\n\nSpeaker 1: the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they do.\n\nSpeaker 1: They do have that, but they don't seem to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: The original ones were working and now these ones aren't, is what you were telling me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, which I don't know, I mean, they're both Viagra AGV, they're both the same ingredients\n\nSpeaker 2: in there, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, one is made in France in a different factory and then one is made in America.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if the AC one worked better, we can switch it back over to that one, that's the American\n\nSpeaker 1: made version.\n\nSpeaker 2: A lot of people just take the different pills differently.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if we need to make the switch, I can make the switch right now, as far as this one that\n\nSpeaker 2: just got charged, they literally just messaged me and said they sent it out this morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can't stop it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want what you could do, if you don't want to just write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll write the notes that this was just a user error, write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: put it back in the mailbox, mailman will take it and they'll send it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what I could do is send you or switch everything over to the American made AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you were more of a fan of that version, rather than the one that has the hundred on\n\nSpeaker 1: it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, the ones that the ones that originally took were had the hundred on them,\n\nSpeaker 1: but, and they worked great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I went to the other pill, uh, because they sent me the 100, uh, stamped on the back\n\nSpeaker 2: the very first time I ordered the AGV from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then the next time they sent it, they sent the other pill and they didn't seem to work\n\nSpeaker 2: as good.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the one that has the AC or whatever on there, but then like, I just got the one hundreds\n\nSpeaker 2: again, stamped on the back and they're not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if the pill is not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to change subscriptions to something different or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll, I'll, I'll switch it back over to the, to the AC, the American version.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, especially if they were taking better, uh, to you, um, I'll switch everything over\n\nSpeaker 1: right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want, do you want, uh, those pills, the American pills right now I can send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, cause I still have some of the other ones that I haven't even used yet, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cause I mean, I think I sent like a 30 day supply or whatnot or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, uh, but, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send a replacement if needed, especially if they're not doing you anything any good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, that's all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I want to do is I want to put a delay or a cancel or something for at least 60 days,\n\nSpeaker 2: 60 days, or like maybe 90 days let's do, cause I mean, I can't, I mean, I don't take them\n\nSpeaker 1: that much.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I had a, I had a kidney and a prostate issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just turned 50, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never had any ED or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got on fucking testosterone and you know, I had problems, I couldn't perform, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then I was like, I got on that stuff for, from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then after I had my prostate shot cleaned out, man, I'm fucking, I don't even need the\n\nSpeaker 1: pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wake back up like, like I'm 13 again.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, I just have way too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just paused everything from now until April.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm also going to do for you is, um, send you something for free called an activator\n\nSpeaker 1: pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's an all natural supplement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what it does is it increases, uh, blood flow down to the genital area and it, um,\n\nSpeaker 2: breaks down anything in your body that's preventing, um, from strong erections.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's helped plenty of my clients in the past that shouldn't do anything crazy as far\n\nSpeaker 2: as side effects or anything because it's an all natural pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, take it for like a week or two straight and it should flush out your system,\n\nSpeaker 2: so to speak.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, um, Viagra should flow more freely throughout your body.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cool, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, I did pause everything for the next, uh, three months, so you should\n\nSpeaker 1: be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need them earlier, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you're just going to send up that other deal you're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what was your name again, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you ever need me again, it's 0040.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0040.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate that, Charles, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
