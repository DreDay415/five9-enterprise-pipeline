    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am. I've got an order that we need to correct. I called Go-Go, Go-Go Meds, they\n\nSpeaker 2: called me back and told me to get a hold of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have an order number if you need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, name and birthday is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It's Edison Pabon is the name, and my birthday is 5-21-1950.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what do you want to fix?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, they sent me, there was two parts to this order. One was for 10, one was for 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: They corrected the 20, they sent me the right one, I mean the 10, but they haven't done\n\nSpeaker 2: anything with the 20. It's still the wrong pills that I received.\n\nSpeaker 1: Say it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. This order was for 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: 20 pills, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I received the wrong ones. I didn't receive the Viagra AGD, I received just regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other part of the order, I ordered 20 and then a bonus of 10. I paid for all this\n\nSpeaker 1: extra. The 10 was corrected, but the 20 was not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the original order is 10 pills, and then the bonus is 10 more pills, so it's\n\nSpeaker 1: going to be 20 pills total. So they sent you 10 of the AGD, and you're calling back\n\nSpeaker 2: to get the other 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're missing 10 more pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, actually, no. I mean, I have two orders here. One is for 10 pills, and one is for\n\nSpeaker 1: 20 pills. That's 30 pills total.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so your original order was for 10 pills, and the bonus of the 10 is an additional 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that means the whole total for the order is 20 pills. They sent you the AGV pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: because it looks like maybe that's what you originally wanted, but you didn't get, but\n\nSpeaker 1: you're missing 10 more pills. So you're calling to get your other 10 AGV pills. Okay, I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: going to have this go out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Is that the order number 6868BFE72C? Is that for 10 pills or for 20 pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: So your entire order is just for 20 pills in total. So you got 10 pills. You're missing\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 more pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Holy mackerel. Who would it be, you or Go-Go that overcharged me for this stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: So 10 pills originally is $63. Okay, 10 pills is $49. The pharmacy charges $14. It comes\n\nSpeaker 1: out to $63. They ask you if you want to get an additional 10 pills, and if you get 63\n\nSpeaker 2: again, you get $29. So that's 10 plus 10, so it's $20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right. Yeah, it's mixed up, because in the receipts under my score board, it shows\n\nSpeaker 2: two different orders, one for 10 and one for 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so your entire order is just 20 pills. That's it. The second order, you got 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're missing 10 more pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and I understand what you're saying, but I called up the receipts that I paid for,\n\nSpeaker 2: and one order is for 10, and one order is for 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so the 10 is the replacement order that you received.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: They sent you 10 instead of 20, so you're missing 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I understand where you're going. It doesn't comprehend it through the receipts\n\nSpeaker 1: that I paid for that are on the score blue website that I signed up for.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so these two order numbers are the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: So these two order numbers, you're saying the order number 72C, ending in 72C, was for 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm showing it was quantity of 20, and then the other order, 46F, was for 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: the extra pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. There's still, okay, so you're going to send me 10 more pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who would I dispute that with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Who would I dispute that with?\n\nSpeaker 1: What are you disputing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the orders show that one order is for 20, the other is 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are two separate orders. Your original order was 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did an upgrade for 10 additional pills. The complete order is 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you spoke to the woman, the woman on the 19th, she sent you 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you were supposed to try those 10 to see if you liked it so we can send you the additional 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I wanted the AGV. That's what I want, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, and that's what you got. Did you try them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and they work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. So you're missing 10 more pills. So you try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's pharmaceutical laws where you can't have a certain amount of pills all at one time.\n\nSpeaker 2: So she sent you half of your order. We always send half of the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you got 10 pills. You call back, hey, I like the AGV. It works for me. Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm missing the additional 10 pills. Can you send them to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: So now, you being on the phone with me, I send you the other half of the entire order,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is 10 more pills because your entire order is only 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you log on to your account, let me just mimic your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you log on to your account and you click your receipt, it says 20 pills is the quantity,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it says pill upgrade. It doesn't say anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill upgrade is connected to the 20 pills, which means it's half and half.\n\nSpeaker 1: We always do half and half. We don't give you 20, give you 10, give you 15, give you 30.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's always going to be split exactly down the middle.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you order 25 pills, your upgrade will be a total of 25 more pills, which would be 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you do 40, you would get another 40, so you would be 80.\n\nSpeaker 1: We always do it in the middle.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand that. Are you looking at my receipts?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at your receipts. I'm looking at your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also have the ability to log into your account so I can see exactly what you're seeing,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm looking at it and I'm explaining it to you because it may be confusing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's the 20 in which we do everything half and half.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's 10 pills and then 10 more pills, which would be the upgrade.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the second order where you see the 10 pills, the woman that you spoke with previously,\n\nSpeaker 1: her name was Shante, she sent you 10 pills so you can try it to see that you like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And once you say, hey, these are great, I like my other 10, I would send you the additional 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because we don't want you to get them and you're like, oh, it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the pharmacy can't take them back from you because they can't use them once they leave the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you did half. You see if it works. You tell us, great, we're going to send you the other half.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. She didn't explain that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I apologize. I'm so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did not explain that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I kind of understand why the 10 on top is showing in my receipts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes. It has a different date for the 19th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yes, I'm going to get this sent out to you today, the AGV. I'm glad that it works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are good to go. Was there anything else I can assist you with, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're sending that to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going out today.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
