No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, Philip, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-20-19-57.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see the doctor put you on refills on every two months, which you did not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: With your VIP status, you have the option.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could put your refills on a hold for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: A lot of people like to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, it keeps your prescription active and keeps you locked in at your prices in case they\n\nSpeaker 2: go up, which I heard they are going to in a few months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, it just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could pause that for you until July 31st, 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got two bottles that I've only taken two pills out of, and they're not effective for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I need to either return this bottle and stop the order or just stop the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I went ahead and canceled you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, if you go ahead and return it to the address on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: GoGoMed 525 Alexandria Pike, they'll issue you a refill once they get that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. We'll be doing that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for taking the call.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
