    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, I'm speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd like to cancel this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: Your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 90670.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Henry Pasillas.\n\nSpeaker 1: D-A-S-I-L-L-A-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, and I see you're a VIP here with us, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going on with the Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why don't you want it anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to cancel it two months ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did it online, they said you're canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I even have an email saying you're canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just noticed I got another one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm getting billed for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We never send confirmation of cancellation through email.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's something we legally don't do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got an email from somebody.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess it's the second, you have the shipper, and then\n\nSpeaker 2: you guys, I don't know how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I did get an email from whoever shipped it.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just tell you to call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, so if you never called us and talked to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: then that's probably why it wasn't canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, OK, let's get it canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there something wrong with it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it not working?\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't realize it was just kept on sending it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got one, and oh, I must have missed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can choose to get this when you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't have to go out that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure why you have it this way, but you can go with it as you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just cancel it either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if this isn't working for you, what we can do\n\nSpeaker 1: is send you some other stuff for free and see if that's working for you\n\nSpeaker 1: and make sure we stop billing you and not send you this one anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just stop everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, correct, but do you want to try to figure out\n\nSpeaker 1: and find something that works for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it would be for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can send you something, our newest Viagra from France,\n\nSpeaker 1: see if that works better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because all these kind of pills, they're blood flow pills, vasopills,\n\nSpeaker 1: so they're subject to people's different body chemistry.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it usually is the case that something else,\n\nSpeaker 1: like a different manufactured pill, could be the answer\n\nSpeaker 1: to getting something to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, no, because if I say yes,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm probably going to start paying for something.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, well, the only thing I'll ask is I'll give you my name and my extension\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll have you call me back after you try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we won't send you anything until you're able to call me back here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully it's working for you, then you can let me know\n\nSpeaker 1: when you'd like more or whatever the case is.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it doesn't, then I'll make sure you never bill again.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a call after you try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, I will send that to you now, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're still at Broadage?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, Broadage Street, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, I'll send it to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And there's no charge on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's all free.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only catch is that I ask that you call me back\n\nSpeaker 1: and let me know how it's working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you give me my name and extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so I'll give you the number again.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 1-800-675.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same number, 6-7-5-8-9.\n\nSpeaker 1: 98-0-7?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and my name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Q-U-I-N-N?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my buddy, he's the name, Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ah, yes, and he won't forget me.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then my extension is 0-0-3-5.\n\nSpeaker 2: 3-5, OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, yeah, take me off.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give it a try, and I'll let you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, all right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, all right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir, you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
