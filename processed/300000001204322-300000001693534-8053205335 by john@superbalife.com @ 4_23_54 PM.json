I ordered three bottles of your product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm on my third bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing's happened. I mean, there's nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no, you know, there's no results.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm on... I've been taking it on an empty stomach like they told me to,\n\nSpeaker 1: but nothing seems to be happening.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should I continue the third bottle or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, there are some people that it just takes longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: One thing I was going to say is I have had people tell me that they've switched to taking three.\n\nSpeaker 2: I realize that'll get through the bottle quicker, but when they switched to three,\n\nSpeaker 1: they did notice some better results, so that may be something worth considering, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then in the meantime, if I get through that third bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: if nothing happens, I'm going to return the bottles to you on... for a full refund, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it depends on when the order was ordered,\n\nSpeaker 1: but yeah, if it's within the 90-day window, yes, you can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I'm just... I don't know. I'm just...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just always wondering. Nothing seems to be going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you. It... I mean, while we do have success with it,\n\nSpeaker 2: supplements are a little tricky. It's different for everybody, but like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: I have heard people tell me taking three has kind of kicked things into gear for them,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that may be worth at least experimenting with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll check it out and call you back. What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name's John.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, John. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Bye-bye.",
