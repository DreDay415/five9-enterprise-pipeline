    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Jimmy. I can't open my account because I don't remember my password.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Maybe I can help you. What are we trying to get done today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'd like to order some of that new stuff you guys have.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Fail-safe one second. Let me take a look at it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I do have your account up. Is this Mr. Myers I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Myers.\n\nSpeaker 1: The reason why you couldn't get into your account is because you had canceled your auto shipping with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like back in June.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And in order to order the new AGV, you have to be on some type of auto shipping program.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could be every four or five months. It doesn't have to be every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we're not going to do it if it's not on some type of automatic shipping for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can always postpone it, but you can't just cancel it,\n\nSpeaker 2: because therefore we won't keep your prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: And for the AGV, it's only for our clients, like I said again,\n\nSpeaker 2: that have some type of return shipping that's going to be done regularly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can always adjust it and work with your schedule,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it just can't be a one-time purchase. That's the scenario on the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to do that, more than happy to do that for you, like I said again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me ask you a question, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to be retiring and moving to the Philippines next year.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how will that affect it?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, well, like I said again, if you're going to be moving to the Philippines,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you want to stop the auto shipping when you do it, you can stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it doesn't have to be every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see last time you were getting the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: you were getting the 40 pills every three months it looks like,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you had just said you didn't want it that frequently.\n\nSpeaker 1: As far as moving to the Philippines, I don't believe that –\n\nSpeaker 2: I do believe we ship to the Philippines currently,\n\nSpeaker 1: but international shipping can get dicey sometimes,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I don't want to make any definite statements.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I would have to cancel it when I move to the Philippines?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, if that's the case.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would rather for you to check on that when that happens,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we can have a better answer for you as far as what we're doing in the Philippines\n\nSpeaker 1: as far as that's concerned.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what do we got to do, and how many of those can I get at a time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, they come in three different packages.\n\nSpeaker 1: They come in 40, and that's for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: 25 is $99, and 10 is $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Repeat those.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get 40 pills for $149 and get 25 pills for $99.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd do the 40, and how often would they reship that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it would be automatically for the 40 pills would be every three months,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you can push that back to, like, every three or four months if you like.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's not a problem as far as that's concerned.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm okay with it once a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, it wouldn't be once a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: It would be every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and get you started here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I have to update my credit card information too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when would the first shipment be shipped out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it would go to the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, it just declined, so I do have to get your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: It usually takes about seven to ten business days,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you already had an order with us before in the past,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it usually takes about seven to ten business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me go ahead and get your payment information updated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like seven to ten days to ship?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, before you receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, to receive.\n\nSpeaker 2: Seven to ten days to ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you need my new card number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm ready for that now.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4147-4004, 7423-6120.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the expiration?\n\nSpeaker 2: 7-2030.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the CVV code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 369.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just should have confirmed this first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you still currently at the 273 Harvey Hollow Road in Somerset,\n\nSpeaker 1: Pennsylvania?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I'm going to go ahead and send you the payment information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I see last time you were getting the Viagra 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to make a recommendation to you on the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know for a fact we get a lot of good compliments about the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And for some people what they do, they get the 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it the same price?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do the 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just secured that.\n\nSpeaker 1: The actual total including shipping is $163.95, just so you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did it through the 40 pills, 100 milligrams of AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, let me explain to you how that's going to look.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to be the same white-shaped diamond pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they're going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you know that it's the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, did they email me a receipt or anything or any tracking information?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do have your email address on the file.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: At johnnyjunkmanrocketworld.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do have your email address on the file.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: At johnnyjunkmanrocketworld.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should get an email stating when the item is shipping with the tracking number on it as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anything else I can do for you, Mr. Myers?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
