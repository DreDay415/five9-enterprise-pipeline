I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to check on your purchasing options you all have for the score blue, Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so right now we have 10 pills for 63, 25 pills for 113, and 40 pills at 163.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm a repeat customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And last month I got a $49 order. What happened to that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not $49. It's $49, and then the pharmacy fee is $14. Together it's $63.95, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think they charged me that last month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you look up my name and make sure that I'm calling the right number?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can double check it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If anything, you might have got a one-time pharmacy fee waive, which is in the beginning of the order,\n\nSpeaker 1: but we don't do that again. Let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You all doing anything for the military?\n\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately not, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you got a one-time pharmacy fee waive, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Other than that, we won't be able to do that again.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a one-time pharmacy fee waive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Standard price is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And for how many?\n\nSpeaker 1: You get 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: They went up since the first time I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they didn't go up, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I was explaining, you got a one-time pharmacy fee waive.\n\nSpeaker 2: But why did I get a one-time pharmacy fee waive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that was your very first order, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, aside from that, the standard price for the product would be the $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was looking forward to what I got first.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly, sir. I apologize for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's a one-time pharmacy fee waive from the very first order you received.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how long does it take for it to get to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will it be shipped today?\n\nSpeaker 1: It will be shipped later on today.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll also send you an email once it does ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: If there's any delays, they'll also inform you through the email.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I shouldn't have no problem getting it by Friday, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll tell you more exact timeframe on the actual email.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm giving you an estimated time, but it's business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, keep that in mind.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, would you like to place an order for the 10 today?\n\nSpeaker 1: And what other option here?\n\nSpeaker 2: $25 at $113 or $40 for $163?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, would you like to place an order?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm thinking.\n\nSpeaker 1: And $25, how much is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me do the 10 again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are we going to be billing the Visa card that ends in A196?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Visa card.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: The order will be in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have any questions at all, feel free to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?",
