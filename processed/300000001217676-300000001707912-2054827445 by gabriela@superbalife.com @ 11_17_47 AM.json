I was on your mailing list to receive every couple months, but my company has moved me to Mumbai, India, so I will not be in the United States, so I need to cancel my orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Lane Ingram, I-N-G-R-A-M. Date of birth is 6-13-1966.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Lane. Okay, so it looks like you actually canceled your account already two days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did it online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but when they sent me the thing back yesterday evening here,\n\nSpeaker 2: it said I needed to call, so I wanted to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's been canceled. You canceled your account on the 24th. That was two days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, thank you very much. You have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Thank you. You too. Bye.",
