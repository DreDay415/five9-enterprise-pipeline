Edward Palas?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Palas in Colorado?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It does look like you are a VIP member here. Any particular reason why we're calling to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you just not need any pills right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just the Viagra or Sildanafil, whatever the generic name is, it just hasn't responded too well for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: It hasn't been the best product for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was something with this new formulation. I see better results, but I just wasn't –\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't do a thing, not even a little wiggle, nothing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not as well as – I took another one, Tadalafil. That seems to have better results with.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay. That's literally what I was going to ask.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you getting that from your physician or are you getting that from another supplier?\n\nSpeaker 2: Physician, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Physician. Gotcha. Okay. If you ever want to try RCL, I'll cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you ever want to try RCL, just go ahead and give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: All of our stuff is FDA approved as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything's been canceled, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sounds good. Could you make sure you email me a confirmation on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Take care. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Bye-bye.",
