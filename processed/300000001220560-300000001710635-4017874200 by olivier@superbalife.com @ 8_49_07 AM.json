Tell me upload a video and upload a video and—\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to—that was based on your state. Some states are like that for some reason for Edie.\n\nSpeaker 1: We got to comply, so you do either a five-second show. A Don Williams did a birth search and search or doctor—\n\nSpeaker 2: Call you, make contact with you. There is 12. Yeah. Well, I'm trying to kick—yeah, I want to cancel the order though.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, okay. Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to—I'm trying to remove my name from the database and—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we—I just—I just—I can't tell everything. 63.95 will be your chamber.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't mind me asking, what placing the order, sir? What doing all of those steps if you don't need the background?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I keep—I was hearing the—\n\nSpeaker 2: Advertisements on the radio, so I looked it up and I—I put my, you know—\n\nSpeaker 1: I went through all the steps that I thought it was like a free trial kind of thing or whatever, and I went through all—\n\nSpeaker 2: The steps and all that, and then then it said, you know, then it said, you know—\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever, you could just buy it. So then I bought it and then it had this whole thing about—\n\nSpeaker 2: All the seller stuff, so I just—\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, the doctor calling me.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the reason why, you know, everything is FDA approved, so it's a—\n\nSpeaker 1: It's, you know, we expediting. You place your order like a regular order, but it was a little bit of—\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor for write the prescription your state if you were maybe in a state like all the state—\n\nSpeaker 1: He just write the prescription if the medical surveys don't drive anything alarming.\n\nSpeaker 2: But your state either you do a five-second short video. We give you a call for five, ten second—\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just a portal, and then when you write the prescription, that initially when you have the prescription moving forward—\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't go through those steps because that's the initial process. You can just reorder or whatever. That's what I'm just explaining you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll cancel everything. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, right. I have my own doctor. So my own primary care physician, so I can just go through them just as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean? So right and bring it in a third party. Oh, I just—\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason is when you order from us—\n\nSpeaker 1: The thing is we are physician in every state and legally to send you Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: We need a physician to write a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why we ask you for medical survey, and based on that you write the prescription for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now you in a state where—\n\nSpeaker 1: Your state require an extra step that we got to follow: the five-second video or have to call, the doctor calling you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But some state we don't have that issue. We just know there is no problem with your health.\n\nSpeaker 1: Prescription written in a few hours. Two to five business day you receive—you get a tracking number, you get your package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's just how it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Learn more about it basically, and then I somehow I did a place in an order and then—\n\nSpeaker 1: So that was all that I've been trying to cancel in a sense, and then the doctor keeps replying to me saying that—\n\nSpeaker 2: He couldn't—they don't do it there or whatever, and I got to call the company themselves.\n\nSpeaker 1: So which I was trying to do online, but then that's why I'm calling, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I refunded you 63.95 is your refund. A local business day and you will receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually we say 5 to 10 business to be safe, but maybe your bank is faster. So you could get it sooner.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I used to pay town anyway, but so can they remove me from the database?\n\nSpeaker 2: So now the way work is that—\n\nSpeaker 1: For security purposes because they have—\n\nSpeaker 2: We have—we have information.\n\nSpeaker 1: We cannot delete account and all that kind of stuff because that's record, right? That you know—\n\nSpeaker 2: If somebody tried to reorder, if they had a profile before it go through that again.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the text message or stuff or email gonna stop because you're not gonna have an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not gonna be indefinitely. That was just the beginning of the process.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything's I've been here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.",
