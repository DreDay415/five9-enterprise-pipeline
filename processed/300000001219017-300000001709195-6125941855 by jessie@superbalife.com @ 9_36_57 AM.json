And Mr. Lovis, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 56359.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And are you at 308 Spruce Street North in Onamia, Minnesota?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. It says here that you're looking to cancel your monthly—\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't take it all the time. So I got—yeah, I got a few prescriptions over—\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. No problem. Let me do this for you then.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna go ahead and just turn that off so it's as needed, so you can order when you feel like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm getting a bunch of stuff. You can do that. Just turn it off for now because I already got about four prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh my god. Yeah, that's a lot. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: To keep your prescription active, what I've done is—\n\nSpeaker 2: I've paused everything for six months. All that means is you don't get shipments. You don't get anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can order whenever you feel like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, if you don't order anything in a six-month period, you just get one shipment just to keep your prescription active, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're not ready, then just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we'll scoot it down the line for you, but because you have a lot—\n\nSpeaker 1: But otherwise, yeah, I got quite a few. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. You too. Thank you.",
