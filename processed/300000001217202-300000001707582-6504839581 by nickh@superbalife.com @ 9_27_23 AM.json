    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I'm trying to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. I can help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you please provide me with the full name and date of birth under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hosein Hosein Be Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: They operate this July 7.\n\nSpeaker 1: July 15, 1970s.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Foray.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: It appears for those written in August for the 50 milligram Viagra AGV, a quantity of 10 each fulfillment. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right now, Mr. Foray.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if you saw in the initial notes back in August.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this is not a subscription; you are not required or obligated to get this monthly if you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could simply pause it and that will allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does show here you have a few refills left under the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but they're sending me every month and I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you don't have to get this every month; it is adjustable, as I said.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you could just pause it and then you can call in and place refill orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, how can I pause it?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right. I do it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can you just cancel it? No, I don't want to pause it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it has never been paused, but if you cancel it you will lose access to the remaining refills under the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now you do have VIP status which locks you in at a low price of $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: That has increased here in the new year. So if you ever wanted to order with us again, you'd see your price increase.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you pause it, you're locked in at that price and then you can call in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter but I want to cancel it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Was it an issue with effectiveness or strength for my notes for the doctor, Mr. Vare?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I never tried it. I tried it once but...\n\nSpeaker 2: The medicine just piled up, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well upon cancellation...\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescription is officially closed. Any future prescriptions would require a new and separate health survey by a doctor and approval.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you accept those terms?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're all set. I went ahead and canceled it for you. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I didn't get your name. Your name is?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Nick. Yep. Thank you. So it's officially canceled now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the prescription is officially closed out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I will not receive any monthly...\n\nSpeaker 1: Delivery, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescription is closed out. You will not receive anything else ever again. Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will I receive a confirmation on that one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you'll get a confirmation email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you so much, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh. Thank you.",
