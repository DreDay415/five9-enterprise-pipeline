Hi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Richard, and I sent an email, but I was told that I needed to call in order to cancel my subscription with Scoreboost.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, Mr. Tramontosi, I see you have a prescription from Dr. Green. We refill, I think, every two months for 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need refill? Do you want to order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm a little strapped for cash right now, so I do need to cancel my subscription at this current time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you don't have a subscription. You have a prescription with refill, and I was saying that if you don't need it to be sent, because like you say, you mentioned that you don't want to have those bills right now, the pharmacy can pause you up to half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you get maybe 10 pills once or twice a year when you're not active, but no more every month or every two months, 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if that—they pause you up to half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just to have the doctor consultation available and kind of lock your price so you don't pay a higher price when you try to reorder in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you're saying that I could do like every six months 10 or 25 capsules?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes. You don't have to get it as often as you do right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was just the initial prescription rating by Dr. Green.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can change that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can advise the pharmacy to pause you for half a year for now so you don't get it on a monthly anymore,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then if you want, we can keep 25 as a quantity,\n\nSpeaker 2: or we can downgrade to 10, whatever works better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's go for 10 if the pharmacy can call me in half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then they can go ahead with an order after they call me in half a year from now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. So I'm placing that—making that change so that way you don't have monthly,\n\nSpeaker 2: but then if you need it often, you want to increase the quantity, you just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So you're all set, and your account is paused,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you locked your price in, and your doctor consultation is still available.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set. Okay, Mr. Tramontosi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
