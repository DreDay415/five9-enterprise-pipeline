    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, Clint speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to cancel this order. I've never placed it, and I've never even received one order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, am I speaking to Terry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you said you never ordered with us before?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've never received a package from you. How's that? And now it just...\n\nSpeaker 1: You live at 208-11 Madison Lane?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, and that's my summer address. I'm not even there. I'm in Florida six months, and I'm in South Dakota six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know how we would get that address and your phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't. No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your medical history?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, actually I don't, but I can tell you one thing. I've never received one package, and I've never taken a Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not the concerning part. The concerning part is that someone would be giving us all your personal information...\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: ...and then sending it to your summer house.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is concerning. That is concerning.\n\nSpeaker 1: The fact that you got the pills, I mean, that's like the last thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the fact is I didn't get the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, of course you didn't. If you didn't order it, that makes perfect sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to cancel this, and I want...\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to try to figure out, you know, because even if we cancel it and someone's got all your information, what's going to stop them from doing this again?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's nobody. There's no... My mail gets forwarded to Florida in the wintertime, and I've never received anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So why you didn't receive these pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have not. I've never received one of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but that doesn't make sense. If you said your pills, everything gets forwarded to your address, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but we still haven't done it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still haven't... I have never received anything, not one time, not from the first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't even know the first order was there until I got a notice yesterday that I know there's another 163.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my wife goes, well, there's 163 from October.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, I've never received any of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: United States Postal Service does have confirmation of delivery at that address at 1:15 p.m. on October 31st, your first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that was confirmed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So even if it went to your other address, they would have sent that to your new address.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the post office. That's what they do.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it makes no sense that you would not receive that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I want to cancel this order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no, we'll cancel it for you, sir. We're just trying to figure out what is going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, me too. I've never taken a Viagra yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not that I don't want to try it, but you know what? You've got to get them before you can try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know. I'm confused on how we would have even ended up sending them there too, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, we did get a lot of information here. It's not easy to do this by accident.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is actually a very hard thing to do, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we can reship these out to you if you want to try them, maybe, possibly.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you know what? I've already went with – now you guys aren't related with Roe, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, Roe is a very dangerous company that's killing people. I would not take pills from them.\n\nSpeaker 2: But Viagra's okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Viagra from the Viagra company is FDA approved from the federal government.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would say that's okay compared to Roe and Friday Plans.\n\nSpeaker 1: And none of them are FDA approved by the government.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could put registered. They're trying to be, but they're not because it's a very dangerous medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're the only company that sells FDA approved product.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it comes from France because that's where Viagra was created.\n\nSpeaker 1: This all comes from the actual creators of Viagra, not a company that's making a fake version of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yes, we have the safest medication on the market.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, not really sure what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't – I'm not saying that I didn't put my information in, but I can verify you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have never received one package, and I've never tried one of your products\n\nSpeaker 2: because I've never had a Viagra to date.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very odd, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very odd.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, once it – I didn't even realize it the first time\n\nSpeaker 2: until I got a notification yesterday through PayPal that I've been charged $163.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I said, oh, they're sending it to South Dakota again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, I'm not even in South Dakota.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we wouldn't know that unless told otherwise.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, did you place it – I mean, was this placed online or did someone call?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because, I mean, if someone did this online on their own in their computer in their house,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, I mean, we had no control over any of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: The order was just –\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So whatever address they put is the address they put.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if no one gives us a different address, then we don't know that you're not there.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's definitely the correct address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm not sure why it wasn't delivered, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have confirmation from the United States Postal Service that it was delivered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's another issue in itself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we can provide you with the information with the post office so you can verify for yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, they did deliver this stuff to that address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it seems like you've got multiple issues going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've got someone giving you information out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've got someone stealing packages from your door.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like you've got a lot going on there, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll just go ahead and cancel you out because we don't want to keep charging you for stuff you're not getting.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you have a good day, okay?",
