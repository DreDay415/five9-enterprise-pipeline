    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks, Juan Viagra, Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn, good aft... No, good morning to you out there, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name's Fred Awanekin. Not bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: We spoke a couple of days ago about this order that I placed initially on December 12th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then another order was apparently placed, not by me, on January 12th with a different credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm not sure about that one. I do see you've got an order on the 12th, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, you had stated at that time, let the package arrive, which it did yesterday, along with another package.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I have since... The doctor for the company said that he had sent 100 milligram tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the initial order was 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I told him how 40 they made me feel, and he said he canceled the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know what's going on. I have two packages.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me take a look. So what I did, those ones I sent you were free.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what we were going to do is send you...\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't determine which is which.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can explain it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the hundreds that you got, it's really just more of a courtesy thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can cut those in half, and it will make a 50 and a 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll actually stretch them out a little longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, but 50 didn't do anything for me, and it made me feel very ill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The new ones I sent you are actually manufactured differently, so they're actually made to not have any of those side effects and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should try those, and you won't. You should not have the same reaction.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I hope not.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. But let me tell you, the new one will say AGV on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Say it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: The newest pills you have will say AGV on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait a second. I'm going to go get that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Here we go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here we go.\n\nSpeaker 1: The original pills that you sent me, 12-13 written, it's first 12-12-12-12-12.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it say AGV? It says...\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we're talking about the newest ones I shipped out, the ones you just received, the most recent ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Again, I have not opened those packages, so you told me that I could send them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but sorry, sent you new pills for free so you could try them to see if they were making you feel better than the old ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was the whole point of me sending them to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I have two packages came yesterday, both of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, already. It is fine to open both of them. You can still send them back if they are open. It is perfectly all fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just try not to destroy the bag as much. You can just simply cut it open.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm opening.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope, these are the same as the first ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it must be the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if the new ones that I sent you, sir, if those are actually working like they should and not giving you those reactions,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't mind even replacing some of the other pills you paid for with the stuff that works. I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, I'm going to open them right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Well, they are 100 milligrams other than 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: But no.\n\nSpeaker 1: They do not say.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will say it on the bottle right there next to the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it says 100 milligrams. Oh, it says AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 milligrams AGB. I'm sorry, I didn't look here.\n\nSpeaker 1: These just say, both of these ones say 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, correct. Yes, so the new ones I sent you will be the ones that are the hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are the ones you should try that won't give you those same reactions you were having.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you don't have any pills or anything coming up until you actually try those and call me back, so no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say that again, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I said you don't have any other orders or anything coming out until you try those and call me back, so there's no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, of course not. Yes, that's what I told you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so send these ones back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that will cancel that order, the second order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you can just keep them and try the new pills, sir, and then I can just replace them with the stuff that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you another 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, don't send no more pills. I got too many now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first batch didn't work. I got nine of them. I now got 10 that you just sent to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes. Obviously, we're not talking about the first two orders because those don't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't have a lot of pills. You only have 10 because those ones don't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have 10 pills that may work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So try those out. If those work, I can send you more for the ones that you paid for, is what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because we can't count the pills that don't work. You're not taking those. They don't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's right. They do not.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that doesn't matter. So what I'm saying to you is that you paid for those, though. I do understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if these ones I sent you work, I will replace the ones you paid for with the ones that actually work for you, free of charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's if these work.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just worried that the doctors don't take 100-milligrammers.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they wouldn't have sent them if that was the case here.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that was the case, they would have just sent the 50s, but I see that they actually did prescribe the 100s to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then for whatever reason, they must have deemed that it was okay, or they wouldn't have sent them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they did approve the 100 milligrams, so you are fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: One tablet by mouth, one hour before sex as needed. Do not take more than one dose in 24 hours. You're safe, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that part. Okay. Let's see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I still have two charges on my card. I still have two charges on my cards right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do I get rid of one of those, or don't I? Only by sending one set back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. If you send the ones back, not the ones that you're trying, the 100 milligrams, but the other 50s, if you send those back, we can give you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's up to you. Or if you don't want to go through the trouble, you can just try the new pills and I can just replace them for you. It's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. As poorly as I felt, I can't believe that 100s are going to make me feel any better, but I'll try them and see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you can cut it in half and take a 50 and see. Start with that and cut it in half, take a 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cut it in half, take a 50. If it's still not working, then you can try the 100. But the key is that this is a different manufacturer. It's not the same creator of the last pill. It's a whole different pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So they mean I can cut it in half, is what you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they have a... Okay. We can cut one in half and see what happens. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm still going to mark this as return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: One of these batches, the one that arrived yesterday, back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Just call me when you send those out and we'll give you a refund for them, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Understood. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Dennis Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Quinn. I'll be back in touch. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.",
