Would that work out for you better?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want to be taken off.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's also the same thing that I'm stating.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine, but don't send me anymore until I ask for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you do understand what I said then, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what order as needed would mean? That you would order yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct. I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so that's what I stated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you like to order as needed? Would that work better for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said no, sir. So would that work better for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it would. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I will do that for you right now. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome. One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: So basically how that works, just so you're aware, we just keep your prescription available and you call for your refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: We keep it open for the next six months, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. Thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Amazing. That is done for you. Is there anything else I can help with?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, sir. Well, you do enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you do too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
