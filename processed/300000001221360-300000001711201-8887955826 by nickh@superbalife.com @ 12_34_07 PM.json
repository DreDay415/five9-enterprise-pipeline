    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't realize this was on an automatic refill and I got a box or a bag in yesterday and this stuff is not working for me. I'd like to return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. Yeah, let me pull up your prescription and see how it was written by the doctor. Could I get the phone number associated with the account?\n\nSpeaker 2: 630-674-3070.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Merrick Cook, 4644.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I see here your most recent prescription was written on December 22, 2025 and that was for the quantity of 10 of the 100 mg Viagra AGV, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I guess so. I'm looking at the bottle here, the thing, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it looks like the doctor wrote it with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're saying it was ineffective. I'm sorry to hear that, Merrick.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's frustrating trying to find an ED medication that can consistently work as a patient myself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Merrick, you wanted me to stop?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I had success with it, correct, but a big thing for me when I was taking it was the diet.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I took it with food, it would be completely ineffective.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I took it on an empty stomach, completely different. It was really, really helpful when I would take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, so I haven't been using it for some time, but when I was taking it, that was the big factor.\n\nSpeaker 2: You need to work on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're telling me. You're telling me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know anyone? I could use a hand.\n\nSpeaker 1: In Chicago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, in Chicago.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Merrick, your prescription, there's a few ways we could go about adjusting it. You know, I can cancel it altogether. What that would do is close out the prescription, and then you would lose access to the remaining refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Another option is pausing it, so should you want to try it again, you have access to it, and you would just need to give us a call to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and canceled that for you, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what do I do?\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't need to do anything else. I went ahead and canceled it. You'll get a confirmation cancellation email, and yeah, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I get a refund for this one that came yesterday?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want a refund, you would need to return it, so you need to put RTS on the package and get it back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once it's filed, you'll be issued a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You give me a number or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you don't need a number. You just need to put RTS on that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: R-G or R-T?\n\nSpeaker 1: R-T-S, as in return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You put it on that package and put it right back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Southgate, Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, so it will be returned to that address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And good luck with the girls.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: He said, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said, if I ever had any food with it, it didn't work at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: He said, if I was on a complete...",
