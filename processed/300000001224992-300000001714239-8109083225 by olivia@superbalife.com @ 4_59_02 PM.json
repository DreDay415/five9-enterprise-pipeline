    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Livia speaking, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Rhonda Fogg, I ordered this stuff for my husband because he doesn't have a card and it's asking for my ID and I don't know how to get it to you guys, I don't know if I did something wrong or what, can you help me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, yeah, okay, so what's your date of birth, or what's the date of birth you entered?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was 8-1-67, that's his birthday, I put his information in, not mine, the billing is in my name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so here's the thing, so I can cancel and refund this for you because unfortunately legally you do have to do everything under his name and then he probably, his ID will probably just be approved, he probably won't need to do the initial, the additional setup step if you place it under his name instead and I can cancel the order you just placed and then refund it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how does that work though, to put it back on my card to like reorder it, how does that work?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, so I just canceled and refunded the order right now to you, so you should see that refund soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can tell you, give me just one second, I can tell you, because my name's pretty good about putting it back, so let me just check it real quick, okay, nope, it's still showing that you guys took it out on the 28th of 63-95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so we're actually closed, I just answered one minute before we closed, but I did process that refund for you, it just does typically take at least a few hours for most people unless they pay with PayPal, then often it's instant, but it could take up to three to five business days, but this weekend what you can do is you can just place a new order for him with all of his information, ideally with him or have him do it himself or with you because you're filling out medical information, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, and that's what I did, but I put it in my name because I thought, because it's billed, the card is in my name, not his, and you know how sometimes if it doesn't match it doesn't go through, and then I just got the email saying that they needed my ID and then I realized that I'm like, it's not for me, and you know, it's for him, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so with us we'll take any card, it doesn't have to match his name, we just need the order to be either placed by him or placed by y'all together with his.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was placed with us together, I just put it in my name, not his, not thinking, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so just either this weekend you can do it or if y'all want to call us back, we are open every day, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific, so unfortunately for y'all we don't open until around 11 your time, but then we're here until 8 p.m. your time, so if you want to do it this weekend you can in the exact same way just with his info, or you can call us on Monday or anytime next week and we can place it for you guys together.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, alright, he's at work, he's going to be disappointed, but hey, it is what it is, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well here's the good news, our shipping is quite fast, and if you want to just place it in these, like once we get off the phone and you just want to place it online.\n\nSpeaker 2: When we replace it, just like when we replace it, I just put his name except for when it comes to billing because the billing's in my name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, exactly, and you want to make sure it's his date of birth, it's his phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is, everything about everything on there is him except for the name, and that's my name.\n\nSpeaker 1: His name is William, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because that's why you got that big error.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, but they do, even though the call office isn't open tomorrow, they do ship tomorrow, so if you do place it tonight, they will probably ship it tomorrow or Monday at the very latest, and our shipping is quite quick, and we ship from y'all's side of the country.\n\nSpeaker 2: We ship from Kentucky, so it would get to you usually within two to five business days,\n\nSpeaker 1: but probably two to four, so yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So am I going to need to take his ID or get a permit?\n\nSpeaker 1: Am I going to have to do that or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I highly doubt it.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as all the information and his name match, you will probably be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you live in Florida, so y'all don't have any additional laws that make anything difficult.\n\nSpeaker 2: The order would very likely be processed and approved pretty quickly, so yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Rhonda.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
