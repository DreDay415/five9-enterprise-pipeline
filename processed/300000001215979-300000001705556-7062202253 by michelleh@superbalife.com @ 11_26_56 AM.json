I had a purchase from you guys back in, I think, June of last year.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I had called in to cancel my services or cancel a subscription in late July.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I see that there's an attempted charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a 5-9-1969.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Is he your VIP status customer?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It looks like on August 8th you called and put a six-month hold on your prescription refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, I mean, that was the point where I was trying to cancel it because I was having some financial difficulties.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, anyway, I see that my card was – they attempted to charge my card on the last order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it was declined due to insufficient funds because I have insufficient funds.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on one second. I'm going to transfer you to that agent that helped you out. Hold on one second.",
