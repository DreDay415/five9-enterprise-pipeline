    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing, Mr. Dishman?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is he.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to modify my account here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: For the shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What would be the new shipping address, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 2: What would be the new shipping address?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, 5452 West Henderson Street, Chicago.\n\nSpeaker 2: H-E-N-D-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 1: Same as the building.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have it here anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Henderson, West Henderson, okay, Chicago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was actually coming to 215 Fifth Avenue North in Salk Rapids, Minnesota.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where it was coming to originally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have that address?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I no longer want that particular address.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want the 5452.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's already gone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when's the next shipment coming up?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me put first Chicago, Illinois.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll tell you in a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not getting properly the address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's going to be same as the building now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then next shipment, because you paused for six months, so it's in June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to redo it starting, let me see, starting in March.\n\nSpeaker 1: March.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I think that's two months from now, I believe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem, is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, not at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: March, what, beginning of March, middle of March?\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't really matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: In the beginning, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: March 3rd.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you want a frequency of 60 days or 90 days?\n\nSpeaker 2: What did I have it before?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now it was paused for half a year, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but what I'm saying is what was my original quantity?\n\nSpeaker 1: The original was monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, that's how I want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want monthly?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get the next refill in March, just call and just double-check that it's on the monthly, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now we need to put a date, which is we're skipping one month, which is March.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you do when you get that refill, you can call and just ensure that it's still on the monthly, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, will do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if it's not on the monthly, they're going to put me on, what, three months or six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: So basically because right now we put March, so we've got to put the frequency because the system,\n\nSpeaker 2: the software shows the frequency next to the date.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you put March, March is not in one month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the frequency next to it shows at least two months, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the only way for us to get you that in March and not in one month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now when it comes in March, you just call, and we're going to reset that regular every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll tell you what, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll tell you what.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll tell you what.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's skip all that and just do April.\n\nSpeaker 2: How about April?\n\nSpeaker 1: And that way I don't have to call.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you guys have enough time, and that way it's monthly, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's the same because we're skipping the month.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going for the month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when that happens, you can just reinstate the month because when I put April,\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to put three months from now because that's when April will be.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I put the date, March, which is a random date in April.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's for us to have that specific date for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We tell the system, Mr. Deshmond needs it in three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the date in April, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: But now when you get that date because after that shipment, you want it now every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you let us know, okay, put me back on every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's going to be scheduled for the month after April, which is June, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: or the month after March, which is April, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just got to get that shipment because you do a delay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to get that delay first, and then we reset to every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you want to keep it in March?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, keep it in March, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when you get that, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be back every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's it for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything looks great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the price still the same?\n\nSpeaker 2: What is my monthly thing now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: We keep you at the same price because you're an active patient.\n\nSpeaker 1: You haven't canceled your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we make sure to honor the deal we offered you a month ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even though a new patient might pay more, but we try to keep the same deal for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a good thing to know and maintain your account, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's no further discounts or anything like that I qualify for,\n\nSpeaker 2: or is it just the way it is right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: If it does, they will apply that automatically in your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it does.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If something happens, you will see, oh, damn, I paid a little less this month,\n\nSpeaker 1: and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that applies automatically when something's running.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
