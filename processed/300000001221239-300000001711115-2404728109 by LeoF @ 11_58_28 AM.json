    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm a customer that's waiting for a delivery to be sent.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was calling to find out is it best to take it on an empty stomach or does it matter?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, definitely take it on an empty stomach. Yeah, that's the best way, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, empty stomach. Well, I don't know, I'm going out to dinner on Friday. I don't know if that's going to be possible.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just try taking it an hour or so before dinner if you can. Get it to activate before you start eating.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see what you're saying. Okay, gotcha, gotcha. And it lasts for up to 14 hours?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and no more than one a day, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. 100 milligrams, no more than one a day. 50 milligrams, you can take two.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I have a 50 milligram tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can take two of those. The doctor will say one or two. A lot of times when guys are trying,\n\nSpeaker 1: the 100 milligrams, they'll either split it in half or take the whole thing or the 50 milligrams, they'll take one or two.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people just are a little nervous to take the 100, so they start smaller.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some people don't need as much. Some people need more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what I could do then is just take maybe one in the morning and one at night?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, yeah, it lasts up to 14 hours in your system, so essentially, yeah, maybe late morning, early evening, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That wouldn't be a bad idea, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, appreciate that. Let's see. Is there a way for you to let me know when my order will get here?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I have a tracking number here for you. What I can do is send that to your email.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have you at davidjonesjones182 at gmail.com. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's david.jones.jones182 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Gotcha, gotcha right here. So I'll send that email on over. You'll see that tracking number in just a sec, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and one last question. When is the reorder take place? Is that automatic or do you have to call me for that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see here. Give me just a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your date would be set for March 22nd, but you can always call us to adjust that if you need it sooner, if you need more time, no issue at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so March 22nd. Okay, so all right. So I need to contact you before then if there's any change?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. If you need any change, just contact us beforehand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Before the 22nd, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Okay, all right, sir. Thanks for your help, and I look for the email. Let me see if I can look right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's in there. It's out of that tracking link, so if it's not in your ePrimary, check the spam,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then feel free to give it a search if you don't see it there as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me check spam here. Cancel. Spam. Junk.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's empty, so let me go to the inbox. Here it is. You're Leo, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is me, yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, your tracking link is below.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just click on that link, and you'll be able to track it along the way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's going to be later than I thought.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, probably just the storm we shipped from the southeast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the storm was later than I thought.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's going to be later than I thought.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, probably just the storm we shipped from the southeast, so it might have affected it,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you should still see that by Friday, no problem there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it come by Friday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, give it a day. You'll see it come by.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir. Well, thanks for your help. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you. Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Okay, bye-bye.",
