    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, how you doing? My name is Darryl Hill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, did you guys get me on file because I had ordered before?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me try to look you up, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Darryl Hill, yes. How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what's the apartment you got for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: My apartment number. What's the address you have?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see. 2F.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 2F. Tell me the whole apartment, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: The address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I have 1351 Rockaway Parkway, Apartment 2F, Brooklyn, New York, 11236.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did it online yourself, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I did, yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got okay with the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, the reason why I called, I wanted to try the new Viagra, the new one, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: How many of these do you have?\n\nSpeaker 1: It said what? It was $15 for $49?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's $10 for $49, or you get $25 for $99, or you get $40 for $149.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually the $25 is kind of the best package.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have too much bill. You don't have too low as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you kind of pay your price in the middle, so you don't run out fast.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the bill comes with $3 and some change, which is smarter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: But now, sir, I've been around the block a couple of times,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's a lot of this stuff don't work, a lot of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, they say how much the new Viagra works.\n\nSpeaker 1: What guarantee I get that I'm really getting the real new Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, because the one that you had ordered previously, say AC300 with some other numbers,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is that's regular, but then the new AG, we're going to say 100 on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's an improved formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: Until we try, we don't know if that could be good for you or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's good for a lot of people. We're constantly sold out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But everybody has his own health history and body chemistry and stuff of that nature.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's been working for a lot of people so far.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why we're constantly sold out and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing we can advise is to give it a try for yourself so you can let us know how you feel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's $99 no delivery.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, there is a pharmacy processing fee, which used to be $9.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it's $14.95 now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, really, grand total, it comes to $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, $113.95, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: How fast does the order come after me ordering?\n\nSpeaker 1: Two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, two to five business days?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see what I got on this account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm coming.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to make sure I had the money in the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what's the next step?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can place your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a card on file?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to use the same card?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: What card do I have on file again now?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, it's 4915, the last four digits.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last four digits, 4915.\n\nSpeaker 2: Should I use that account?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so every time I have to, like, when I want it again, I'm going to have to place the order, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Y'all don't take our money automatically, do y'all?\n\nSpeaker 1: We can do both ways, whatever works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm getting such and such pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send me some in three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can schedule that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can make adjustments at your convenience so you don't have to call.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to send that your way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know that I'm getting my little pills every such and such, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you can schedule your frequency.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not forced to have a specific frequency.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just let us know how often you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so now suppose I don't call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Y'all guys don't place the order, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: What we do for you to lock your pricing, we pause the account up to half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: So to maintain your price in your account, you just got to get 10 pills once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not necessarily every month or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can get the 10 pills for $49 once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: That guarantees your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: That guarantees your priority access to any Viagra coming over, anybody that's new.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that guarantees your price, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, okay, so we're going to do it like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you said that's only twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let's say next month, y'all guys don't place an order unless I call and tell y'all to place an order, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not placing anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we pause you for 90 days, it's 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: We pause you for half a year, it's half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not placing anything before that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's say you want once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: If in half a year you get 10 pills scheduled, the next 10 pills would be in another half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to be every month after that anyway because you're not on every month frequency.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so yes, I want to try the new Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I need to update my card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: The one you have on file is no longer working.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me give you a one, two for update, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll give you one second, okay, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you ready?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it was a 447, I mean, I'm sorry, 4427568027206385.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0828.\n\nSpeaker 2: The code in the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: 619.\n\nSpeaker 2: 619, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I updated it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want the 2500 milligram AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the 25 is for $99, no?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, this is the newest Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the newest Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have a different code on the pill than what you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's an improved formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the newest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one that you're going to say AC with some other number,\n\nSpeaker 1: that one's going to say 1-0-0 on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Diamond chip.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you want regular shipping, the one that we're covering,\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-5 business day, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: What other way can I have it?\n\nSpeaker 2: What other way?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, we can do priority mail 1-3 business day, which is $15 extra.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can do 7-day air shipping, $28.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1-day air shipping, $38.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do the regular.\n\nSpeaker 1: Regular shipping, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm proceeding right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I place your order, Viagra AGV, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when do you think you would like to have your next refill scheduled?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's try to, what you said, you said what, a half a year?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to pause?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to pause for half a year?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You told me something about a half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause the prescription for half a year so you don't receive anything in\n\nSpeaker 1: between unless you call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, unless I call, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unless I call, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that be for the 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That be for the 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm changing quantity for the next refill in half a year for 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if you need more, you can call for more.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, but you, yeah, I just have to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now, you're putting it for the 100 milligrams, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What else are we going to have?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'll call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, now suppose, suppose I want the ones that I get the first time,\n\nSpeaker 2: the Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just call and place an order, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can as well, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But any Viagra, Sidenafil, that's the scientific ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, the formulation is different.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why you're getting the AEGV now, which is a different formulation.\n\nSpeaker 2: The biochemistry they did to make it work better, you know, that's the recipe.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's the newest one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the newest.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's supposed to be the newest and the best one now so far, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so far.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the one that I'm getting in a couple of days or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the Rolls Royce of Viagra basically, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that ain't Sidenafil or nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the 100% Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so Sidenafil is the main ingredient for any Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: even the old version that you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra is a scientific, is a commercial name.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the scientific name for this type of medicine is Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get Cialis, Cialis, for example, is the commercial name.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the real scientific name is Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, we just call it that because, you know, commercially we have names.\n\nSpeaker 2: But really, now what makes the difference is the formulation,\n\nSpeaker 1: the elaboration of the medication in a laboratory.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what makes the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, I want the AGV or I want regular, generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's why each pill have a different code to recognize which formulation is that, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want the best, you know, the top of the line, the newest one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's what I'm ordering now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's very good that I get your phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, anytime I want to place an order, I just give you guys a call and we can take it from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds like a plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: And all together, the total is how much?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're all set?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that comes in the regular mail, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: That ain't a USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will I get a notification of tracking when it's on its way and when I'm supposed to receive it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll be able to anticipate your delivery.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like a plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
