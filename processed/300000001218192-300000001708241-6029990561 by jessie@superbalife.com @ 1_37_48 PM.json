    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. My name is Robert Jasper.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Mr. Jasper. What can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, look, I've been getting pills from Sore Blue for years. Now today, I got another bottle in the mail today. I just got them not too long ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gotcha. Do you want me to slow that down for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, look, I called back. I had someone else on the phone, and they said, no, you're set up for a program where we'll send them out every when you sign up for it. I said, no, I don't have no program. I call when I need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, no. We'll just set it up for at will. Okay? We'll just set it up to where...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, he says I got to send them back. Well, what the hell? I mean, I got to pay the postage then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the ones that you recently received, did you want to return them, or did you just want to keep them instead? Because if you do want a refund, you'd have to return it, though. That is a bit of a pain.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, look, you guys have been so nice. Two times ago, they sent the wrong ones because I ordered the new ones, AGV or whatever you call it. They said, well, just we'll send you new ones, and they did. They never asked to get them back, the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, they do. In this case, I'm just letting you know, for a refund, they will ask for it to be returned. In that case, it was a replacement, but this is a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really don't want to have to hassle you, but if you want to hold on...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Look, I had nine, and now I got ten more. That's 19. I don't want... I don't know. I'm just going to...\n\nSpeaker 1: Here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, I'll just... I'll tell you what, just cancel everything, and I'll get the pills somewhere else, and I'll be done with you guys, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you cancel this, just so you know, and I'm sorry if the other guy was just a little too hasty or whatever or annoying, just bear in mind, Mr. Jasper, you can't get the AGVs from anywhere else because we have the exclusive deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just letting you know because people eventually want to come back, and we can't re-up their prescription, so here's what I can do for you. You won't get anything in the mail. You won't get any random stuff and all of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll go ahead and just do away with that, and just set it up where we'll keep your prescription active, okay? You order when you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had it that way all along. I had it that way all along. Why did it change?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you place something online, it might have triggered something.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never did nothing online. I did it on a telephone, and they called from Scottsdale, Arizona. That's where they came from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, well, let me do this for you. I'll see if I can get someone to get you a return label, so that way you can return this recent one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that would be great. I got that. Okay, all right. You can email me that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. We can keep your prescription active, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically, all that means is you don't get anything in the mail. If you don't order anything in six months' time, you will get one refill at the end of the six months to keep your prescription active. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, if you don't order anything, you get nothing. You don't do anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: See, they never told me that before, so I don't want them. I want to order them when I want them. That's what I want to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, but that's what I mean. You can. This whole thing is set up to where you order when you want to. You don't get anything in the mail. You don't get any of that. You don't get a monthly. You don't get two months. You don't get three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing is we need to keep your prescription active, so you only get one refill in July if you don't order anything. That's it. If you do order anything…\n\nSpeaker 1: I ain't going to order anything. I'm not going to order anything. I don't want any more in July. I got 19 pills now, and I'm 84 years old.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you are returning one of them, so essentially you're losing 10 of that 19.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'll look in my email for the return label, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but we are pausing this, correct? Because if you don't pause it and we turn this thing off, you can't reorder. That's why I'm giving you a heads up. It's always a headache for people down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't understand what you're saying, but when I want them, I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I'll set it up this way for you, and again, you won't get anything else in the mail. You'll only get one refill at the end of six months, okay, if you don't order anything. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. But I don't want nothing in July. I won't need anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. We'll get your…\n\nSpeaker 1: Then I'll just send them back. Look, if I get them, I'll send them back. How's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. That's totally up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Then send me that return label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got my email, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: We have your email address.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Bye.",
