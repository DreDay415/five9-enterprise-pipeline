    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Kenneth Frank.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Kenneth, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was okay, so I received another order from—\n\nSpeaker 1: Govo meds. I didn't sign up for an automatic—\n\nSpeaker 2: refill. I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Did a one-time prescription. I—\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why sending me more pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I can look into this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What, you want the RX number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, what is the phone number—\n\nSpeaker 2: associated with the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: 774-292-1528.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great, and what's your date of birth, Kenneth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Five thirty sixty six.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's not what we have. You said five thirty sixty six—\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, for—\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you have there? I probably put a fake one down.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's not good.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it sounds—well, I don't—you usually don't put info over the phone. That's probably why, but—\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I can give you my name and address. Kenneth Bryant.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I've seen 80 South Street, Bridgewater.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1980 South Street, Bridgewater.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, so I do see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean if you don't want to receive—\n\nSpeaker 1: Regular refills, those bi-monthly with your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place the prescription on hold—\n\nSpeaker 1: For up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription—\n\nSpeaker 2: Would expire if we didn't refill it. And the way that would work—\n\nSpeaker 1: Is if you did want to place it on hold, say you would still have the option to order in the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I want to cancel this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, in that case, that does make sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: The last part of my job is to let you know that if the pills don't work for you—\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you do qualify—\n\nSpeaker 2: For a free sample of their newest highest quality product because you haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it comes with a five-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not interested.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep us in mind. We are the only sellers of that product in the entire world.\n\nSpeaker 1: We—I want to get a lot of my question, my question, my question for you is why was I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Put on an automatic refill when I didn't sign up for that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I usually avoid—\n\nSpeaker 2: answering that because I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't want to activate anybody, but when you signed up online—\n\nSpeaker 2: There was an agreement that you made where it did state in writing—\n\nSpeaker 1: With your prescription, the doctor will subscribe—\n\nSpeaker 2: Will prescribe you refills. If you want to make changes to those, call this number, and it was this number—\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, for us to call directly. And because we didn't hear from you and you did agree to that—\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor sets up a prescription refill based on the number of pills you ordered, and since you ordered 25—\n\nSpeaker 1: It is safe and appropriate for the pharmacy to send those every two months according to them, unless you call—\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know. Hey, how much—how much was I—how much was I charged for that?\n\nSpeaker 1: The exact same price as you were the very first prescription, which is $113.95 for 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I—I would like a refund and I will return these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine. Of course, you can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I can email you the directions for how to do that. The email we have on file is—\n\nSpeaker 1: K is in Kenneth Bryant.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1980 at Comcast.net. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. So yeah, once—\n\nSpeaker 1: We receive the product back, of course, we can refund it, and you have a 90-day window, which is great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so that, you know, I'm gonna send you—it’s gonna say return and refund—\n\nSpeaker 1: Instructions, so just keep your eye out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will you cancel the prescription please starting right immediately?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Return and refund—\n\nSpeaker 1: Instructions.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, just keep us in mind. We are the only FDA-approved third-party tested—\n\nSpeaker 1: Company that sells that product in the entire world.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it is a great—\n\nSpeaker 1: Product. We'd love to have you back to order some. We just wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample at a later date.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I hope you have a great day, Kenneth.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, did you cancel the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, why would I tell you that I did and not—why could I get a confirmation number? Would you like to ask me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Could I get a confirmation number?\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have those, but your prescription is definitely canceled and I'm looking at it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, could you email me something that states that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, no, but the prescription is definitely canceled and these calls are recorded.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, good employee I am. That's true.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, no for an answer. All right. Bye. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can, I think.",
