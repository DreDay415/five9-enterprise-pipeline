    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, this is Tyrone Morgan. I'd like to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can help you out with that. Right now we have a deal of the month.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can get a quantity of 40 for $149 and then we have a quantity of 25\n\nSpeaker 1: for $99 and they come in 25, 50, and 100 milligrams and it's all the same price\n\nSpeaker 2: so might as well go with 100 because you could break them in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, you said you got 40. You said there's 100 of them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so a quantity of 40 is $149 and then we have a quantity of 25 for $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, the quantity of 40. I'm your biggest customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. All right, and then I do have, I'm going to tell you,\n\nSpeaker 1: the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee so a total of 40 comes out to $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Okay, all right, perfect. First, I need your email address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, email address, tyronemorgan64gmail.com. I'm already on your file already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you are? Okay, can I have your phone number so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not the one... Sure, yeah, because I got a new number now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not 347-602 no more. I got a new number. I got to give you my new number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your old number, though? I think you called in on your new number,\n\nSpeaker 2: right, because that did not pull up your account. Okay, what's your old number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, 347-602. I forgot the other four digits, but I changed it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't remember the last four digits?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, I don't remember the last four digits.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, let's pull you up by... What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Tyrone Morgan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Tyrone Morgan. Zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Zip code 1027.\n\nSpeaker 2: There we go. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, 7-27-1964.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Tyrone. I see you're a VIP status member, and okay,\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you're getting 50 milligrams. Do you want to switch that to 100? It's the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, what, is it more important if it's 100?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so you're getting 50s. You can get 100s and break them in half.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, that's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm taking 50s now. Yeah, I'm taking 50 milligrams right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're on 50s. Okay, give me one second. I'm going to change it to 100s.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that won't be... Like I said, when it's 100, I mean, if 100 milligrams is 50,\n\nSpeaker 2: wow, that's like, it's still 11 minutes and still 14 hours lasting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's exactly the same medication. It's just 100 milligrams. Or you can stick with the 50s if\n\nSpeaker 2: you want. Whatever works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm doing 50 now. Maybe 100, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Look, I don't want to kill my 50 now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just don't exceed more than 100 milligrams in 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, because she loves it, though. She loves it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, that's awesome. Okay, perfect. And I see we have a visa on file ending in 0781.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to use that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect. That went through. They'll be shipping it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
