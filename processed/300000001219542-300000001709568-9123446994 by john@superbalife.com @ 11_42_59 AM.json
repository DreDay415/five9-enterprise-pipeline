    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, this is Kenneth Peters. I had recently, as of today, received an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was supposed to be the Viagra AGB, which is what you guys advertise.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got sent some generic something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I was trying to figure out what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll help you out here. I need your zip code.\n\nSpeaker 1: 28713.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we do sell both regular generic and the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 2: so there's a chance that there was a mix-up somewhere in the filling process, and that's what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you got the regular, it is still a safe product, but we will get you the right thing no matter what.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you on 81 Second Street Road?\n\nSpeaker 1: I am.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I received was the Sildenafil secret ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, even the AGB is Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the active ingredient in any Viagra, but it's the inactive stuff that makes the AGB different.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what can confirm it for me is if you could take out a single pill and tell me what you see stamped on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Standby.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on. I'm on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's AC333.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so you got the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yours would have said 50, just 50, so I'm going to get you 20 of the right ones, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, those are safe, so if you want them as a backup plan, you can keep them, but you can also toss them if you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just going to get the pharmacy to send you out 20 of the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, of the actual AGBs, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, of the actual AGBs.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to cost you anything. You've already been charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm putting it through as a $0 transaction, so you'll get shipping emailed to you, but it's not going to actually charge you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds great. I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you happen to know how much money would be worth if they come in? We've got a trip coming up, that's why I'm asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll ask them to do priority to get it out to you sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. I appreciate you. Thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, sir. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
