You can click the red button that says quick refill so you don't get blindsided in the future. So you go to your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you need anything, but I did exactly what you wanted. And my name is KT Goodrich. I put a stop to any and all monthly refills, and I overrode the system, and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges. When you go on the dashboard, I appreciate that, but I don't want it paused.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want it canceled and removed. Because every time I've called to cancel, it doesn't get canceled. I gotta go, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will never use you guys again.",
