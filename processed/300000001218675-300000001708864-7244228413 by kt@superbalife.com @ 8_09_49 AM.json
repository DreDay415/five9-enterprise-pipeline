    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Rob?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did three things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for holding, and I take a lot of pride and honor in my work as a veteran.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I did three things.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is exactly what you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, and I overruled the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a stop to any and all monthly refills, and I definitely put a stop to any and all—\n\nSpeaker 2: monthly charges, and I paused your prescription, and I was buttoning up your chart, and you—\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I noticed?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a couple things in your chart that says something, and this is good.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, has patient Anderson ever experienced any hardness and or erection within a 30 to—\n\nSpeaker 2: 60 minute period?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I have to just fill that in.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it says, has the patient ever experienced emotional or erection or hardness within 68—\n\nSpeaker 1: Or longer than 68 hours?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then something has, are the patient Anderson experience any adverse side effects other—\n\nSpeaker 1: Than erection or hardness within a 24 hour period?\n\nSpeaker 2: So basically, I'm glad that you spoke on that side effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like with Dr. Nat, we'll bill him, and we'll send you a, we'll put a stop to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything, but you already paid for, I can at least replace the 40, because we're just—\n\nSpeaker 1: Hearing about this now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can replace it with something new and improved that has little to no side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the one I'm on, but I'm on the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get it to a, because the way you take it is you take it with water, Robert.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as you take it with water, no highly ultraprocessed oils or foods, it'll go smooth—\n\nSpeaker 2: Down your esophagus, and it disperses like a web and a grenade going off, and it goes—\n\nSpeaker 1: To your gut lining, and it tells your gut to send about 70 to 80% to your brain, which—\n\nSpeaker 2: Goes, which I mean, goes from your gut to your brain, and your brain tells your gut—\n\nSpeaker 1: Your head tells your, your brain tells your heart to send 70% of blood and oxygen.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way, you don't get the headaches, and when you're getting the headaches, it's too—\n\nSpeaker 1: Much blood is rushing towards the brain and not your Johnson, if that makes sense, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So don't worry about it, but I put a stop to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not going to get charged anything at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's not worry about it at all, and these are just replacements, and I'll just bill—\n\nSpeaker 1: The doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: So see how these go.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're free.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you 40 to replace everything you just got that weren't working for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just go and just let me know, take down my extension at 0037, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name's Chase.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, put a stop to everything right now, because I don't want to be paying no more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't, but it doesn't even make sense for you to keep paying for something that—\n\nSpeaker 2: Doesn't work, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is what we're doing with throwing the damn Hail Mary to kind of figure out you're—\n\nSpeaker 2: Already baked in like over a hundred bucks, at least I can replace the January, because—\n\nSpeaker 1: We're just hearing about this now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could take care of this to the doctor, and I'll send the billing to him, let him eat—\n\nSpeaker 1: The damn fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: You already ate the last fee that didn't work, and then I'll send it to this spring church—\n\nSpeaker 1: Right?\n\nSpeaker 2: On Lindsay Run Road, and then what I'll do is that's going to be free.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send 40 of the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take it easily, light diet, whole foods, no ultra process, like I said.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have time for this, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Based on this medication, we have three to four months to figure it out, because if you—\n\nSpeaker 2: Want more of this, we're all sold out of this one, because nine out of 10 men that do have—\n\nSpeaker 1: Experience, any adverse side effect, this is what we send them.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get the pill, don't worry about the labeling on the actual bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll probably say the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to look the same, but you'll see it says 50 on it, all right, Robert?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then from there, just let me know in a few months how's it go, because I got to tell—\n\nSpeaker 2: This doctor what's going on, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got to see if it's working for you or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's good for our dad, it's good for him, and then we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry about any charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm billing this guy, and I'm sending you a replacement for this 163.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the best we can do to make you whole, right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0037, Rob.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just call the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call the number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Set up the wait and damn line, and my name's KT Goodrich, 0037, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not here for a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're here for a good time.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're already going through a lot of crap in this era of life, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So just have fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Rock and roll, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take it easy.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
