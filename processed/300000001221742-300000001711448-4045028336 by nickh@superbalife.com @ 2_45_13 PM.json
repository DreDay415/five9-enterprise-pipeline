    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was trying to get Score Blue. That's supposed to be the latest and greatest, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Score Blue is the telehealth service.\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell multiple things at Score Blue. So we sell name brand Viagra, we sell generic Viagra, and we also sell Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you calling regarding the new medication, Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. I was ordering that when I ordered, and I got the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you do the order online?\n\nSpeaker 2: I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's take a look here. Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Doug Blacken, October 18, 1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Doug, can you tell me what the bottle says on it? Does it say Apco Pharma on the bottom right, or does it say Greenstone LLC?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 100 mg of generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to know where it's coming from. On the bottom right, it should say Apco or Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, on the bottom right of the white label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Apco Pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it looks like, I don't know what was selected online. I was just confirming, because it does show that the doctor wrote the prescription for generic Cidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted the Viagra AGV, I think it was just a technical error. I can get you those replacements, which would be a quantity of 40 of the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me get that handed to you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so I went ahead and put that through, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and I'm not in no kind of prescription, am I?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no, this is a prescription. Do you mean subscription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like reoccurring?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, some patients do it that way, where they organize it to every bi-monthly, tri-monthly, things like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I usually recommend for patients first starting out is we put your account on a pause, so that allows you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that would be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I went ahead and sent you those replacements, and I'm going to go ahead and put your account on that pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got it. Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
