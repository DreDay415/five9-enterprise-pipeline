    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. My name is George Dujaraj.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm receiving some generic Viagra that's called...\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I have your phone number so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you want?\n\nSpeaker 2: Your phone number so I can pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh. 586-405-1014.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: March 12, 1944.\n\nSpeaker 2: Profile that does not have any orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: You might have more than one profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That profile didn't have any orders yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do have two profiles. There we go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It looks like the pharmacy made an error\n\nSpeaker 2: and you did not receive the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just received regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why am I not receiving the AGB or whatever they call them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It looks like the pharmacy made an error.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes when they run out, they send generics\n\nSpeaker 1: and they don't tell us, which creates a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: But give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out the replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm\n\nSpeaker 1: you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll be shipping this out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So when you get this new bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: on the bottle it's going to say AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted\n\nSpeaker 2: is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm\n\nSpeaker 2: you received the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now your bottle says APCO\n\nSpeaker 2: and on your pills it says AC390 or 340\n\nSpeaker 1: or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just go ahead and throw those in the trash\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm going to pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause it until July 31st of 2026\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'll give you my extension\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can call me back and let me know\n\nSpeaker 1: how the AGB worked out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mike.\n\nSpeaker 2: These that I received,\n\nSpeaker 1: they don't have any effect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so just go ahead and throw those away\n\nSpeaker 1: because those are just generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to charge for these?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm not because you didn't receive\n\nSpeaker 1: the correct medication in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's free of charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I paused your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you have time to try out the AGB\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'll give you my extension\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can call me back and let me know\n\nSpeaker 1: how it works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it takes time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't pan over here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Extension what?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Rochelle?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle, M-I-C-H-E-L-L-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see what's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll call you back when I get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, when you try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call me back and let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is your phone number 800-675-9807?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9807, yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sometimes they run out because they're in such high demand\n\nSpeaker 1: and they don't tell us and that creates a bunch of problems,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I got you out the correct medication\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're going to receive a quantity of 40 of them\n\nSpeaker 2: to replace all your orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
