    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I wanted to cancel my account\n\nSpeaker 2: because I only wanted to try one time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought it was a one-time purchase,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you guys charged the second one\n\nSpeaker 1: and sent me the second order to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't authorize that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I wanted to cancel my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Steve Lee.\n\nSpeaker 2: Date of birth is November 7, 1975.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, thank you, Steve, for confirming that information.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yes, it looks like you do have a prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: for Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you do get a quantity of 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that does come with a monthly interval, which is\n\nSpeaker 1: why you received another order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you guys didn't say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because when I ordered, I thought\n\nSpeaker 2: that was a one-time purchase just to test it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then without notifying me, it would just send me the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you guys charged me.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you want me to return the pills\n\nSpeaker 2: so that I could get the money back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or how's that going to work?\n\nSpeaker 2: So yes, so we don't do one-time orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: The prescription does come with a monthly interval.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you feel like every month is too stringent of a frequency,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can always go ahead and adjust that to your preference.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we can modify it to every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, right now, I just want to cancel it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I do need it later on, then I'll reorder it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then right now, I just want to test it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't even finished the first order yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, what I can go ahead and do for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: since you still haven't tried it, is that I can go ahead\n\nSpeaker 1: and pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not canceling?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, because in case if you like it, if you cancel it,\n\nSpeaker 1: that means you wouldn't be able to reorder with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you decide to pause it, and you end up loving it,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I'm pretty sure you are,\n\nSpeaker 2: because this is the best Viagra that there is,\n\nSpeaker 1: then you'll be able to continue to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: And for the meantime, it'll be paused.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're not going to have to charge an entire callback\n\nSpeaker 2: and say, I want to reorder, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, we can pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, since now, I mean, so if I do cancel it,\n\nSpeaker 1: then what's the reason?\n\nSpeaker 2: You wouldn't be able to reorder with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do suggest you to pause it for the meantime.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that's fine, but, you know, just what about\n\nSpeaker 1: the second order that I didn't approve to order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I want me to return it so I can get the money back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or how's that going to work?\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be the last order that you receive for right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: until you call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but you guys have to advertise\n\nSpeaker 1: the money-back guarantee.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what, is that the false advertisement?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, but I suggest you to try it first\n\nSpeaker 2: and see how you like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What if I don't like it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would try, like...\n\nSpeaker 1: Then you can go ahead and return it,\n\nSpeaker 2: but at least try it first.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you, like, forcing me to try it first right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I tried once and it didn't really work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I don't, that's why I'm,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, I still have the first one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have, like, eight pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you guys sent me the second one,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is, now I have 18.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how long it's going to take me to try all that,\n\nSpeaker 1: but, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's why your prescription is paused\n\nSpeaker 1: for the meantime.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, what you can go ahead and do\n\nSpeaker 1: is take two capsules at the same time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be equivalent to taking 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that you can feel more of a potency.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what's the...\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, what I'm saying is,\n\nSpeaker 2: how, what do I have to do to get my money back\n\nSpeaker 1: for the second one that I didn't order?\n\nSpeaker 2: You would have to return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so how can I return it?\n\nSpeaker 2: The return address will be found in the back of the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Joseph 525, Alexander Pike, Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just return it back,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you guys return my money back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you receive it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, is that the only process?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, if you end up loving it,\n\nSpeaker 2: then you should might as well just keep it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're just kind of assuming that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: that I'm going to keep loving it.\n\nSpeaker 2: What if I don't?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, if you don't end up liking it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I mean, if you end up loving it,\n\nSpeaker 1: then might as well just keep it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, then I'm going to call you back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give us a call back, bye.",
