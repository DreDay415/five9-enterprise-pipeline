How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How are you doing, Mark?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. I'm a little stressed out, but I'm sure I'm going to get some answers here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had called you guys a week or two ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to cancel my subscription. You charged me $63.95 again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mark. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure it's March 17, 1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Okay, let's see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I called to talk to the gentleman, he said he was going to credit me the amount and he was going to send me some new and improved…\n\nSpeaker 1: Why did he only send you $10 and not $30?\n\nSpeaker 2: He wasn't supposed to charge me anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: He says, I'm going to send you this as a trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: He says, I'm not going to charge you because you've been a VIP customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and then I see the notes from our pharmacy. They can't FedEx to a P.O. box.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on. I'll refund you right now. Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle, I need a $63.95 refund. I've canceled this thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I just send the product back, it doesn't work for me, so I don't care about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to toss it in the garbage.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you received the AGV, right? The replacement from the 16th?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me double check.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, take out the pill because the AGV, the only number imprinted on the AGV is the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those aren't working for you either?\n\nSpeaker 2: These aren't the 100. So I just got these.\n\nSpeaker 1: So these I just received. I haven't tried those yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I put you on a brief hold really quick?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on one second. Thank you.",
