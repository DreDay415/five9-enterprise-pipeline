It says it was delivered today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Taylor, check the mailbox. It should be out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's in the mailbox?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's in your mailbox. A postman puts it in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. I'll go check it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow, that's something else.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Leo.\n\nSpeaker 1: Leo, okay, you stay cool, be strong, do right, don't move on,\n\nSpeaker 2: maintain your strength, keep moving on, and you will live long.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.
