    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ken McEwan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Ken. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm so glad to hear it. How can I help you today, Ken?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was wanting to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this. Okay, Ken, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6-24-71.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 410 U.S. 60 Panhandle, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Yeah, so I see your prescription here. Yeah, Ken, so if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option, if you do want to keep overall access to the script without those, to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order, you can. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I got you. I just want to go ahead and cancel it because I don't know how to get a hold of y'all and I don't know how to get some more if I need some more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So the last part of my job, I'll keep it short, and if you're into it, great, and if not, no worries, is if the pills didn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do qualify for a free sample of our newest, highest quality products, which it looks like you haven't tried and it is a superior prescription to yours.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way the free sample works is it would be 10 pills of the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes directly from our Pfizer labs in France. It is FDA-approved and third-party tested,\n\nSpeaker 2: but my favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache, and if you did want to try it, I would send you 10 pills today.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd probably get them by the end of the week, and you'd have until July, so basically six months to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe you would, and we believe based off of the reviews and the data that you'd call us back in May or whenever to order some, and then we might be able to keep you, and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not, you just have 10 free pills, and you just need to let us know about your lab where you're at, but it is a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome, and thank you for the offer. I just want to go ahead and cancel the subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I saw y'all planned on sending me some more the 19th of next month, I believe, but I just want to go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course. All right, well, you know where to find us in the future. We'd love to have you back, especially to order that product I just was talking to you about.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are the only sellers of it in the U.S. and in the world. We paid a lot of money to be able to say that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to purchase it. We wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample at a later date, but we'd love to have you back, and I hope you have a great day, and you know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay, thanks, Ken.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
