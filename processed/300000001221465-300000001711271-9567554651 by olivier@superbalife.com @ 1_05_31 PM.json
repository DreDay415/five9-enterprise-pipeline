    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, I need to cancel a subscription that's on my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr.\n\nSpeaker 2: William Hoskins.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to get it canceled from the get-go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was still without a thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember what it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they said I needed more information.\n\nSpeaker 1: They didn't send it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I found out they charged me for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I tried to get them to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: They wouldn't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I questioned why they wouldn't send me what I put in for the new blue pill, or what\n\nSpeaker 1: was that old stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they still didn't answer my questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I got charged two months in a row, and I didn't want it to start with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's fix that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I heard that you didn't receive what you wanted, as you said, and then also you don't\n\nSpeaker 1: want refill as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to get refill as often.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can order as needed as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the other option.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I can send you a replacement with the AGV, if that's what you mean to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they didn't send this other out.\n\nSpeaker 1: This already got here, and they charged me for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two months in a row.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two months in a row.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two months in a row I got the wrong stuff from what I was wanting it to start with.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's fix that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's fix that, Mr. Hoskins.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can move forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can move forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can help you if you like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you can send me a replacement with the other, but if I don't want it, I don't want\n\nSpeaker 2: to get charged again for it if I don't like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to charge you anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: You already paid.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'm going to do, I'm just going to replace those two orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pill you have, probably say AC 300, something like that on the pill, the one I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: going to send you is the most improved, newest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to say 5-0 on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to charge you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I do on the side to avoid you to get it as often, because obviously you need\n\nSpeaker 2: to use what you have first, I'm going to put a pause on your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think they pause you up to half a year so you can reorder, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that will...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it works, I can order it once a month, but I don't want it just coming out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: For now, we're going to pause the prescription, but as soon as you get it, if it does the\n\nSpeaker 1: job that you want, call us and you can get it on a monthly or whatever you want to do,\n\nSpeaker 2: every two months, every three months, but for now, they're going to pause for half a\n\nSpeaker 1: year, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I'm going to try that if it's a year that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you 25 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have five extra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You pay for 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to receive five extra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not charging you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this is the...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the newest formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't mix them together.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're different.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a different code on the bill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one that you have, say AC300...\n\nSpeaker 1: I just throw them away?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the one you're going to receive, going to say 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the AGV, newest formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try it, enjoy it, and call, let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're going to adjust you on a monthly or every two months, whatever works better\n\nSpeaker 2: for you, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they'll have you down as...\n\nSpeaker 1: Talk to me as the agent.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I call them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: So they'll have you down as the agent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the person I talk to when I need to call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate you adjusting it for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give it a try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, give it a try and give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've tried some others and all, but that there just...\n\nSpeaker 1: The Viagra works for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is Viagra works for you or did you try Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is Cialis better?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that's also a good question sometimes you ask.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't remember sometimes, but Viagra works for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I can't remember something I took before, but they really made me feel weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: It works, but it was...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was, uh...\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a tube, sliding the pill or something else I think it might have been.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know, but...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, let's try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill didn't do nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's try that because it can be a great med, but some patients, it depends on your body\n\nSpeaker 1: chemistry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes your body resists even it's the best med.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's try that, the new formula, which is the good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everybody loved it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If not, we're going to try another round.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good one.",
