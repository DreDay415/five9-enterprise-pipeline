    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, what was your name again, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Ollie speaking, Viagra score blue, Mr. Brian Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, did you say your name is Ollie?\n\nSpeaker 1: Ollie, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Mr. Ollie, I had an unauthorized purchase put on my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did a one-time purchase, and y'all charged my card and sent medicine that I did not request.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me pull your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Johnson, yes, I see that you have a prescription for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I do not have a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I purchased a one-time purchase,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I did not authorize y'all to charge my credit card any time you wanted to.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a one-time purchase.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir, I'm going to help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to go over what I see on the screen, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to inform you about what's going on with your purchase\n\nSpeaker 2: and all the things work so you can understand better and we can resolve, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the first thing is what you need to understand is this is a one-time purchase,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it doesn't matter what the system says.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm telling you my card was unauthorized to be charged again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I heard that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And do you want me to help you so we can move forward?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, why are you saying you've got to go over all this other stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that's protocol, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got to read what I see on your account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we're going to proceed with the issue that you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have a prescription, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, the doctor wrote it with refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: You order 40, you got an extra 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they usually order with refill, but because you get 40,\n\nSpeaker 2: you get it, I think, every 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said you think that I get it every 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I do not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I told you this was a one-time purchase of what was on the screen.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was not a refill every other time that it comes up.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that was the way the thing was.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why they process a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't need refill, you can return that one for your refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can write refuse return on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to get your full refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just trying to explain to you how the prescription was written,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then when you don't need it, like you said, it's a one-time,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can also order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can be like, hey, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need the initial written prescription the way it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let me tell you something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me tell you something, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do I return these?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because your website, gogomed, I pulled it up,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it says the domain name is for sale.\n\nSpeaker 2: I couldn't even go to a login to a website.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, it's not gogomed2go.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's coreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, it's coreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the document that came with the paperwork says gogomed,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it gives an email address.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're saying this came from who, blue, what?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: So gogomed is our pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: But a company you need to talk to for any adjustment that you need,\n\nSpeaker 2: like right now, refund is coreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gogomed is just the name of our pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for customer service-related question and issue, it's coreblue.com,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the phone number you're calling right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're in the right phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, the package you received that you say wasn't right,\n\nSpeaker 2: you want that refund, you just write two words on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But listen to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when I filled out the application online,\n\nSpeaker 1: I filled it out as a one-time purchase, not an automatic refill,\n\nSpeaker 2: no auto refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So somebody, if I'm not speaking to someone at blue.com right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's why we're going to refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're just returning and you're going to get your refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how do I send this?\n\nSpeaker 2: But what's the address I return this to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you still have the package it came with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to find it here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So who do I return?\n\nSpeaker 1: You have the package where it came with, the shipment package.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it doesn't have a name on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Johnson, please listen to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the package where it came with, the original package?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that package is very simple.\n\nSpeaker 2: The label that you see on top,\n\nSpeaker 1: find a space where you're going to write refuse return.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I didn't even know it was from you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I opened the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've already opened the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try to close it nicely as you can,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that way you don't have to get another shipment package and pay for\n\nSpeaker 2: anything because we already paid for that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you close it nicely.\n\nSpeaker 2: You open it because obviously you need to see that,\n\nSpeaker 1: oh, that don't belong to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the post office know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you write refuse return because basically you're saying that you got\n\nSpeaker 2: delivered the wrong package and the mailman take that back to the source,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is the pharmacy where it came from.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very simple.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when he take that, he's going to scan that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there is an original tracking number that we have in your account here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when it's going back,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're going to see in that tracking number that the package is going back to\n\nSpeaker 1: the pharmacy for your refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now my next question is,\n\nSpeaker 2: is there any indication on your system that I'm going to be charged in the\n\nSpeaker 1: future again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because this should not have happened in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's my point.\n\nSpeaker 2: This should not have happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: I charge against my account in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I refuse to return it next month,\n\nSpeaker 1: they're going to ship it again because it's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is two things we're going to do today, Mr.\n\nSpeaker 2: Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you tell me you want to reorder yourself as needed,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to ask the pharmacy to pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're not going to have monthly refill or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order 10 pill once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you say, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: going to need the VAG or in the future,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're just going to cancel your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in both scenarios, you're not going to get charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I want to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to cancel my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then just write two words, refuse, return on the packet.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to refund you 163.95, a full refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now we're here to help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If there is any mix-up, we're here to resolve.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to get you your refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very simple.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two words on the packet, seal it nicely, send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: 163.95, we'll be on your way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now the next process, what do I have to do to cancel my account?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just canceled your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've done it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you going to send me an email verification showing that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can give you a confirmation number, matter of fact, over the phone right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Please do so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: 482.\n\nSpeaker 2: 482.\n\nSpeaker 1: The letter A, the letter E.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nine, I mean, 095.\n\nSpeaker 2: 095.\n\nSpeaker 1: The letter B and the number two.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me repeat this back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: 482.\n\nSpeaker 1: 8E.\n\nSpeaker 2: 095B2.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just return that package real quick.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll get you your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: 163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing to worry about.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're here to assist.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have customer service for you at your service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just to say it, let me make sure I got all this right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 482.\n\nSpeaker 2: So give me your telephone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to be sure because I dialed a different phone number first.\n\nSpeaker 1: I dialed that go-go meds or whatever it was and couldn't get through to nobody.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe I have everything now so I can send a copy of this back with them too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe I have everything now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just return.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, try to close it nicely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Make it look nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: Write refuse return on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can leave it in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how your local post office works, but if they're not too bad,\n\nSpeaker 2: you leave it in the mailbox, they're going to take that back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you can take it and just throw it in the shipping box at the local post\n\nSpeaker 2: office location.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, the tracking number attached to the package we sent you\n\nSpeaker 2: is going to show us it's coming back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, your refund is going to click in.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can follow up maybe four days after and check on, you know, the status.\n\nSpeaker 1: We get you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there's $163.95 and you'll be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your account is fully canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel the doctor prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep in mind, you tried to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: The order might not go through if they don't want to finance, again,\n\nSpeaker 1: a new doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or if it does, you might pay a higher price.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not going to send you no VAG or you're not going to have no child.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Charlie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
