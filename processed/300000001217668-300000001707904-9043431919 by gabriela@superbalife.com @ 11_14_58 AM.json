    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. My name is Rick Wilson, and I signed up for some medication last month, and they've given me a subscription to this stuff, which I didn't ask for. So I need to make sure that I got another bottle of it before I even finish the other one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Ricky. Yes. So it looks like you already called in earlier today, and Agent already assisted you, and he canceled any future orders for you, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do you have some type of cancellation number there that I can use? Because he hung up on me. I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry to hear that. But, yes, it's confirmed that he did cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm taking a look at your account, and you're able to confirm that by logging in into your account, and you're also getting a verbal confirmation, which is why we have a customer service team.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Will they send me a confirmation on that via e-mail, or what do I do here?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. That's how you're getting a verbal confirmation.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the whole point of having a customer service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good day. Bye.",
