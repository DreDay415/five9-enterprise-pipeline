    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. My name is Kerry Bushman. I have a prescription that I wanted to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Kerry Bushman, October 11, 1959.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Kerry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just found out that they actually charged me for a prescription, but it hadn't been mailed yet. I'm trying to get that canceled. I put a ticket in last night with your customer service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. So it looks like that order shipped out already. So it's currently in transit. You should be receiving it soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I have contacted my bank to put a stop payment on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can just send it back when you receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, you can ship it back to us. But yes, for the meantime, it already shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, in regards to your prescription, you do have a prescription active with us. So that prescription does come with a monthly interval, which is why you're receiving it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah. That's why I'm trying to cancel it. I canceled it a couple months ago, but I guess there's a recurrent charge. I mean, I didn't realize that you were going to charge me again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So you don't necessarily have to have it every month. We can always go ahead and adjust that for you. We can modify it to every two months or every three months. We can even do it four months or five months. Something will make it work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I would just like to cancel the prescription completely. I just don't feel comfortable with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that means, Kerry, is that you wouldn't be able to reorder with us in the future because that would be canceling the prescription and canceling the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: We wouldn't let you reorder later on.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we can always go ahead and pause it, and we can pause it for half a year. Would you like to do that instead?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. Let's just go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, if it cancels moving forward,\n\nSpeaker 1: Just be aware that you're not going to be able to reorder with us, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You're welcome. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your help. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye.",
