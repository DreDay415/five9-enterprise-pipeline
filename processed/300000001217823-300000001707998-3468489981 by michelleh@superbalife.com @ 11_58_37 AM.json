    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. My name is Tim Everson. I was calling to discontinue my refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered this score blue one time, and I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then all of a sudden it came again and automatically charged my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was like, okay, but then all of a sudden it came again\n\nSpeaker 2: and automatically charged my account again.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, Tim. Let me help you out. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-18-78.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status member.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I see the doctor put you on refills on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay. It's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just really don't like the slight headaches that I get afterwards, but it's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. So with your VIP status, you don't have to have your refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: What a lot of people like to do, since you have VIP status now, you have the option.\n\nSpeaker 2: A lot of people just like to go ahead and pause it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your prescription active and keeps you locked in at your price point\n\nSpeaker 2: and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could pause that for you until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. That would be fine. I really just want to discontinue it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'd just really like to discontinue it, just take me off.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I do need it, I'll call.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I can send you a quantity of 10 of the 100 milligrams of the AGB for free to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think you might like those better than the 50s.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me send you 10 of those, and then I'll go ahead and pause you for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second. I'm going to send you out these first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because, honestly, it's the same price, so you could break them in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm sending them for free, of course. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligrams. Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, that went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm going to go ahead and pause you until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you don't need a refill by then, just give us a call and you can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it just keeps your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like when people call and cancel, what they don't know is we have to pay the doctor's fee every time someone cancels.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's just easier.\n\nSpeaker 2: It saves us money if you just put it on a hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then sometimes the doctor yells at us, like, hey, you can't keep doing that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So perfect, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll get those in about seven days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, this weather might be a little delayed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, try those out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think those will definitely not give you a headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you so much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, Tim. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Bye.",
