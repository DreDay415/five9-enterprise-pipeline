I want to cancel this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know I had an ongoing thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Darren Lomaster in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay, Darren, it does look like you're a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 2: With your VIP status, it's not a subscription, but a prescription that gets written up with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't necessarily need the refills every single month, we completely understand and get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not everybody pops these things like M&Ms every single month and is having sex as often.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you'd like, we're very customer friendly here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can go ahead and pause everything for the next four or five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you've got some time to kill a little bit of what you've got and order them whenever you need them next.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll call when I need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll go up to half a year then. That way you've got plenty of time to do all that, alright?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, sounds good. I hope you have a great rest of your day, alright?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, bye-bye.",
