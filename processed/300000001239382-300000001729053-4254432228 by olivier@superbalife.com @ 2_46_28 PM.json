    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hello, my name is Alan Torres. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not satisfied with the prescription that was sent to me by Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: What happened again? Can you repeat that for me, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not satisfied with the prescription that was sent to me by Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Was it your first time taking Viagra, Mr. Torres?\n\nSpeaker 2: I see you got Viagra 15 minutes ago. Was it the first time?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't get the prescription that I was ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And what are you trying to order?\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV, the new Viagra. Not the generic, regular Viagra. It was the AGV one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And do you have the pill in front of you, by any chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I have what?\n\nSpeaker 2: The pills in front of you, by any chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I have the pills in front of me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what is the code engraved on the pill, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it says AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to have to send you a replacement. It should say 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 is the improved formula, and that would be the code on it, coming from Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you have probably said, APCO is regular generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why your order came this way. From what I see, it just shows regular generic here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you the AGV, which is the improved formula, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can keep it as a backup. The FDA approved from Pfizer, made between the U.S. and France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to send you a replacement. Of course, you're not going to be charged. You're already paid.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, they're going to be. Don't get them together, because it's two different formulas.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try them separate, so you can see the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so I'm going to send you the AGV replacement here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you'd like to try it, I can switch.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want me to stay on the phone?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're all set, okay? I just finished that for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: When will it arrive?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: When will it arrive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
