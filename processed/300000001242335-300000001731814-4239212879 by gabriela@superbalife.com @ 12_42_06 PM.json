How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I ordered online from you guys the new Viagra AGB or whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys just sent me regular old Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hell, I get that a hell of a lot cheaper than what you guys told this to me for.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Glenn Kreitzer, K-R-E-I-T-L-I-T-O-M-Z-Z-E-R-E-R, and date of birth, 10-30-1962.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well it looks like your order shipped out already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm sitting here looking at it. It's incorrect. That's why I'm calling you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's wrong with it?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not Viagra AGB. It's not the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I saw you ordered the AGB. You said you opened it already.\n\nSpeaker 2: So can you take a look at the pills? Do they have the number 100 engraved on them?\n\nSpeaker 1: What?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you open the container and take a look at one of the pills, does it have the number 100 engraved on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it says A, B, 3, 4. It's junk.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, it looks like they sent you the, it's not junk. They just sent you the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 1: They sent you the classic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So don't worry, Glenn. I'll notify the pharmacy so that they're able to reship your order at no additional cost, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So they will be reshipping your order and you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't ever make another mistake again or I won't do business with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they should be able to correct it. I don't know why they sent you that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But okay, so I'll ask them to reship your order, okay, Glenn?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to throw this shit in the trash. It's no use.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can throw it away. You don't have to keep it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's gone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't screw me again.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you should be receiving the right one. Okay, have a nice day, Glenn. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you too.",
