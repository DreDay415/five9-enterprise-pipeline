    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra for speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is Richard Garrett.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right sir, nice to meet you, how can I help you out today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have a couple of questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just received an order and I was a little confused because when I went online it said it was $49\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I added another 10 pills for $29.40 and then when I went into my banking I got charged $63.95\n\nSpeaker 1: plus $29.40.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes, so that $49 is the price of the medication but the pharmacy fee is the difference\n\nSpeaker 1: to get you to $63.95 and then you're correct, it was $29.40 for the additional pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so if that's going to happen, it's actually cheaper for me to stay with Bluetooth\n\nSpeaker 1: because I get free shipping and I'm paying...\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're paying for quality here, you're paying to be, you know, we're actually approved by the federal government.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is FDA approved medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's actually coming from a pharmacy and a doctor which is why we have that fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bluetooth, very, very dangerous medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not FDA approved because of the stuff that they put inside of it and it's not coming from a doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: or anything like that which is why they can send it out without these fees and they can send it out without a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yes, it is a little cheaper but it is ultimately, I can almost guarantee you that a couple months of using that,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, things will not be working for you as well as they was, you know, in the beginning\n\nSpeaker 2: because of the dangerous stuff they put in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, so I understand this might be a couple bucks more but I mean for the safety and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: for, you know, peace of mind that this is actually a federally approved product, you know, it does help.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, that's why a lot of people shop with us because of that security.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I definitely understand, you know, pricing thing but this is actually a lot safer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Second question.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can even waive that fee for you this time, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't mind doing that for you so you get a chance to actually try this out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, here's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like 72 and I only use about two pills a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So actually for 20, well, for 20 pills that's going to last me for a few months\n\nSpeaker 2: and there's nothing on your site to where you can put a pause on it which I've been on other sites.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just go to your prescription when you log in to the site and you can actually delay shipments\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can stop them for like up to about a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: But any kind of other major stops or pauses we can do on this site because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: we have to contact the pharmacy to make any major changes, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: because like I said this is coming from an actual pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you can get this like one order every six months if you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can set this up to get your orders whenever you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, here's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't because I tried to do it online and it won't let me.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can do it for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can set that up for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so at this point I would need one prescription every six months\n\nSpeaker 2: but that would only be the 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's the only way that I will change.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you can always change this as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to keep it this way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can always change this and, you know, however you need to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, I went online and there was no option for me to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I'm calling.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's under your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I said, it's not for any major changes like five or six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's only for about like a month or so that you can delay it\n\nSpeaker 1: because anything over that we actually have to contact the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All set.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you'd like, I can give you my extension as well, sir,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you need to change anything or need any further help in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because like I said, I haven't even tried a pill yet since I've received them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so my name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my extension is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, it would be nice if they would explain that there was another fee\n\nSpeaker 1: on top of that, $90, or excuse me, the 49, but it does not.\n\nSpeaker 2: It definitely should have.\n\nSpeaker 1: It definitely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you just align or did you call and put this in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: There was an ad in Facebook.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's where I found it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the information is on there when you order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But no worries, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will not happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are all set because, like I said, once every six months we'll work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I do have one other question, but it's not on this paper.\n\nSpeaker 1: According to my prescription, I was supposed to be getting the – oh, shoot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have that information right in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and according to – is that actually what I received?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it's a blank pill, and according to online,\n\nSpeaker 2: it had the three letters in this pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it won't actually have the AGB on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just marketing.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says it on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when I went into the prescriptions, it had that one,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I was supposed to receive, and then it also had a generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what's the difference between the two?\n\nSpeaker 1: The different manufacturers.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it doesn't even say on the label that's what I received.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm – that was another question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, it definitely should say AGB on the bottle that you received.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does not.\n\nSpeaker 1: So did I actually receive the correct thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can find out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to contact the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go get the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oops, it ran away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it does not say that whatsoever on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, it should.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see what I can do here.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says generic for Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it does not have those three letters on it whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it should have that on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pill should actually just have a 5-0 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just going to do you a favor.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to reship it out to you, sir,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm also going to notate the account, so whatever happens,\n\nSpeaker 1: it doesn't happen again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that would be wonderful because I'm going – because I lucked,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I just haven't had time to call it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should be getting what you ordered, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to go ahead and reship that out to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what did you say?\n\nSpeaker 2: Somewhere on here it was supposed to have what?\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get these pills, it will be a white pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: and on one side it will just have the milligram dosage,\n\nSpeaker 1: which would be a 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it will say AGV on the actual bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the main indication.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is not on this pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm reshipping it out to you anyway, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't even worry about looking at it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to compare them when you get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will notice those differences.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, you got my extension if you have any further questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what do I do with these round ones?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can keep them as a backup, throw them away, whatever you'd like, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was obviously on us, so no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: We won't have you ship it back or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I won't be charged again, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can order this as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically what we can do is we just keep your prescription available for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, you're going to get the one every six months as you stated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll wait and see when the new pills come in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully they're correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, they definitely will be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the identification on this says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that would be a different manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we just reshipped it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure why.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to contact the pharmacy now and see what happened there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're very welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
