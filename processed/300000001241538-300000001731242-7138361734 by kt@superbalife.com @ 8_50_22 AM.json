    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Leon. Yes sir. But remember my name and my extension so you can use me as\n\nSpeaker 2: reference and I'll be your guy moving forward. My name is KT Goodrich. Leon. And\n\nSpeaker 1: then my extension is 0037. Just think of killer Texas. 0037. And here's what I did\n\nSpeaker 2: but I did exactly what you wanted. The first thing I did is I put a stop to the\n\nSpeaker 1: monthly shipments. And the second thing I did is I put a stop to the monthly\n\nSpeaker 2: refills. And the third thing I did is I put a stop to the monthly charges. And I\n\nSpeaker 1: paused your prescription and I credit back your account for the 212. And I put\n\nSpeaker 2: a stop to that shipment that was trying to go out. And in light of all this bud\n\nSpeaker 1: you know what should have happened and it really grinds my gears. Did the doctor\n\nSpeaker 2: at all reach out to you to just see like hey how's these things going? Are they\n\nSpeaker 1: too strong for you? Because normally the AGVs were all sold out of the 50\n\nSpeaker 2: milligrams and they're very potent so guys got to pull it back when they call\n\nSpeaker 1: in. But what's your case? What's the situation there? Were they too strong? Any\n\nSpeaker 2: adverse side effects or what was going on? I have no issue right now. I was just\n\nSpeaker 1: trying to counsel because I got oh lord I got two bottles in there or three? Oh\n\nSpeaker 2: no no so you got two now. So I understand it's a frequency issue and if you love\n\nSpeaker 1: them great because that's the news we get. Yeah and right now I want to\n\nSpeaker 2: counsel again. I will just call back in the future. I will call back in the future\n\nSpeaker 1: if I want to start back up again. Yeah so what I did for you is I did something\n\nSpeaker 2: better bud is I set it up where when you go to scoreblue.com just like how you\n\nSpeaker 1: ordered. You're gonna log in with your Yahoo account right Leon? And when you log in\n\nSpeaker 2: there you're gonna go to a category that says your prescription and then\n\nSpeaker 1: you're gonna see that I put a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So anytime any anywhere anyplace even if you go from Houston down to Miami you\n\nSpeaker 1: update your shipping address you can click that button and you can get a\n\nSpeaker 2: refill your command and your demand. Just know that the only caveat is in the\n\nSpeaker 1: state of Texas we're not authorizing to legally send you more than one refill in\n\nSpeaker 2: a 30-day period and two refills within a year. So as long as you maintain 20 pills\n\nSpeaker 1: a year or every six months well you'll be good to go. Okay but use those though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah that's what I'm saying I'm good to go. Yeah so good so if you need. That's what I'm saying right now\n\nSpeaker 1: right now right now financially I need you just counsel. Hmm so if I cancel\n\nSpeaker 2: this in its entirety bud and you know you're not able to use that button in\n\nSpeaker 1: the future and have access to the 50 milligrams right. So let me put you on\n\nSpeaker 2: hold so I can so I can try to work that out all right bud one moment.",
