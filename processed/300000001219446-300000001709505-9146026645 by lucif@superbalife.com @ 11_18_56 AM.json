Let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 10507.\n\nSpeaker 1: 10507?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: First name John, last name Vargas, V-A-R-G-A-S.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okie dokie. I do see you are a VIP with us here, sir. Do you mind if I ask why you're canceling?\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, because I have a heart condition and doctor told me I can't be on anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow. Um, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's concerning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, and um, this isn't something that should be cleared for in the future?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because we can always just not bill you or send you this for, I mean, like a half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could be like six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, well, as of right now, nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know. That's why I'm saying, like, you know, six months down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, um, yeah, I just thought I'd just completely stay off of it until he says anything different.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, well, can't see you out, man. Anything else?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's basically it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, well, you have a good day. You're canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, man. You too. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
