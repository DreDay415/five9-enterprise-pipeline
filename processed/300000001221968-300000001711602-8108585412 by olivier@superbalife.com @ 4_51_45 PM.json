Hi, I'm Scott, I'm calling about being overcharged.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, ok, let's see what's going on for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: When were you overcharged, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, going back to my orders now, I was overcharged on the very first order, which charged $69.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you were refunded, the first order you placed, everything was refunded.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ok, then...\n\nSpeaker 1: The very first one that you have, everything, you got a peel upgrade, was refunded.\n\nSpeaker 2: The original order was refunded, the testosterone bottle was refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ok, so then I guess it would be November then.\n\nSpeaker 2: So November, it was a refill with your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it was about three months later, it was a refill, I think, with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the first order was on the 9th, and then the 11th, like two months later, you got a refill with your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: From what the doctor wrote initially.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, but why was it $69 instead of $49?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's... Oh, ok, that's your question.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's $49, but there is a pharmacy processing fee of $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: It used to be $9.95, I think it went up to $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Shipping is free, there is no tax, it's just the pharmacy processing fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's on every order then, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, it's every order, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ok, then how come you charged me $49 before then?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you weren't charged $49, it was...\n\nSpeaker 1: The original order came to $63.95, the first reimbursement.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have half off for an extra 10 pills, it was cancelled, refunded $29.40.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you had one testosterone bottle refunded as well for $29.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So every order, it was always $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like regular order right now, if you go place an order online yourself, you will see $49 plus the $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: How does it get to $69.95 then?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63, $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so it comes to $63?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: So from now on when I go to place my orders, that's what it will be, $63.95?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, let's put it this way so at least you know the global, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, well that's what I need then, I'm pretty much all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you're all set sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please call to reorder, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
