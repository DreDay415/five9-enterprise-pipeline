    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hello, how are you? Good, thank you for asking. Mr. Keith Elton? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let me pull your prescription. Can you verify your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: June 22, 63. Oh, you're in New Jersey, right? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I see that you have a prescription. You have a VIP account with Score Blue for\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription, 100 milligrams, Viagra, 10 tablets every 30 days. How can I help you, Mr. Elton?\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to cancel that. You just don't need the refill? You want to order as needed yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I want to be able to handle it myself. Okay, okay, that's fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: A couple things. The reason you had your refill is because the doctor initially wrote\n\nSpeaker 1: the prescription because you get 10 tablets. There are 30 days in a month,\n\nSpeaker 2: so most patients are active, so they assume you need the Viagra, but if that's not your case,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're not required to get it every 30 days. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to advise the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 2: to stop the initial 30 days frequency. They're going to pause the prescription up to half a year\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can just order as needed, okay? To lock your price in, you can get your refill 10 pills\n\nSpeaker 2: once or twice a year, okay? And if you need it more often, you let us know. We'd be happy to\n\nSpeaker 1: serve you as well, okay? Okay, so that won't be coming out of my account anymore, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, they're going to pause the prescription, okay? But you can reorder. It's still going to\n\nSpeaker 1: be available. We're going to lock the price in. Like I said, you don't have to get it every\n\nSpeaker 2: month. You can get it once or twice a year, okay? Okay. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can even call at some point if you feel like you're active. You can call and be like,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, Mr. Elton, can you send me 10 pills every 90 days, every 60 days? And then after you pause\n\nSpeaker 1: it again if you don't need it. You see what I'm saying? They give you the option to manage\n\nSpeaker 2: your prescription at your liking because they give you a VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm in charge when the money's coming out of my account or I send the money, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can call us, okay? They're going to pause you and then you just call.\n\nSpeaker 1: You log into your account. You press the quick refill button.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you answered, Mr. Elton, okay? I've updated your account, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But thank you for calling and you have a good week.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
