Is it that you have enough supply at this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me, I didn't hear you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I said what's going on. Is it that you have enough supply at this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I didn't hardly use any, just one, but it didn't seem to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have an appointment with a urologist this next month to see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what I can go ahead and do for you while you go and see your urologist\n\nSpeaker 1: is that I can go ahead and just pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause it for the meantime, and then once you talk to your urologist\n\nSpeaker 1: and see what's wrong with you, you can always call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this one that's coming out or is supposed to come out in February will not ship, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're welcome. So just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'll call when I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
