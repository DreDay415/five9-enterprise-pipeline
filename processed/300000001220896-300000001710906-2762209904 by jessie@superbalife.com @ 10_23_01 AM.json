    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, my name is Jessie, may I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jessie Randall Carter, can you pull my count up and see when my prescription will be refilled?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. Mr. Carter, what's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 24216.\n\nSpeaker 1: 24216. I have you at 4309 Randall Road in Appalachia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Was the road named after you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but I think it was, but they didn't actually say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just a little old coal mining town, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: You could have just said yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you know, actually it's a railroad town because the railroad was out in front of me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it worked out good anyway, didn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it does. That's kind of special.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and the next one will be shipped on, will be charged on Feb 27, unless you need it soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: What time?\n\nSpeaker 1: February 27, it's every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Every two months, oh, instead of one month, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can we up that from, it's 25 now, can you up it to the—\n\nSpeaker 1: 40?\n\nSpeaker 2: 40 would be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do you want 40 every two months instead?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'd be good. That way I'll have some back stock, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, no problem. Let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much will 40 be?\n\nSpeaker 1: The 40 would be, that one is, the package is $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: $149?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's up substantially, ain't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you're getting...\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get 25 now for 63, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much?\n\nSpeaker 1: The 25 pill pack is $99.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. I was thinking it was 63.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the 63 was the 10 pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I was right on the numbers or just wrong on the packs.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right shoe, wrong foot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let's see, so 25 is 99.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, and after taxes and fees and everything, it comes out to $113.95, just so we're clear.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they say the next shipment's when?\n\nSpeaker 2: February 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: 27, the end of February.\n\nSpeaker 2: End of Feb. I mean, you can place the order now if you want, but it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You let me know what you're going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: They won't let you ship it before...\n\nSpeaker 1: At this point, they might as well because it's been about a month, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, I've got 12 pills is what I've got left.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just ship them whenever you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just do the 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: I ain't going to up it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to...\n\nSpeaker 2: Stick to the 25?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to process this today, or do you want to process it another day?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you can, that'd be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I've got that much money in the bank.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had to buy stuff from my damn oven, and they hit me the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're supposed to be putting it back in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know how poor people live, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You may not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I certainly do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's just, you know, we have to worry about the check to check.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: I am there with you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have a MasterCard on file that ends in 9655.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should we use that card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'd be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope it'll go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it don't, I'll go ahead and put $350 in the bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it don't go through, you let me know somewhere or another,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll go put money in the bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: I may be broke, but I can come up with a few.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me process it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Send it as soon as you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's in process.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did it go through?\n\nSpeaker 2: It went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I know I can't have much money left in the bank.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't wait until payday.\n\nSpeaker 2: It ain't been about two or three days now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're funny.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you have a good evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for talking to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Carter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
