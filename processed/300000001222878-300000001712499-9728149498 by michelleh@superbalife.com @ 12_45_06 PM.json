How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. It's been a hectic day here.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I finally talked to Wells Fargo on my credit card, and they said that, yeah, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could pay them, but they said it's going to take a few days because Visa has put a hold on that particular vendor from charging on your card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, well, best thing, I'll just give them a different credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said, that would probably be the fastest way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here's a new card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. So we're going to send you out 10, and then I already sent you the activator yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. All right. And then update card. Okay. I'm ready now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 4147-2027-6115-6189.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-30.\n\nSpeaker 2: Three digits on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4-4-9.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Perfect. That went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then let me go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll pause it until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you need a refill before then, give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't, call us, and we can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish I did. I wish I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: You gave one earlier?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And then, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you sent me 10 more. You sent me 10 more, too, you said, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're getting, yeah, the 10, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're getting 10 more. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I really appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, well, it wouldn't have taken my time or yours if they'd have sent me the right thing the first time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm sorry about that, but I'm glad you got it straightened out.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all that matters.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all that matters.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're a very nice lady, and I told them there at Wells Fargo and also emailed them that your company is really top-notch.\n\nSpeaker 2: You honored everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You sent me replacements.\n\nSpeaker 1: You gave me credits for what I sent back, and it all worked out great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they need to make sure they log that into their records, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Don.\n\nSpeaker 1: We appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
