did not expect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I don't know how or why you sent me\n\nSpeaker 2: a package of ScoreBlue or BlueScore or whatever it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can I get your phone number, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's 585-733-0623.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I did fill out and go ahead and do\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 pills a while ago, maybe a month and a half ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe a month, two months ago, and it's just to explore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I, and yeah, I expected that's all that was going,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's all I was going to do, and I wasn't even sure\n\nSpeaker 1: how my wife would even take it, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: That I went ahead and did it, but yeah, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need anymore, I don't want anymore,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I was surprised that I even got them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and can you confirm your name\n\nSpeaker 2: and your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Kenneth Hallett, 2-19-19-60.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you have an opportunity to try out\n\nSpeaker 2: the Viagra that we sent you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Were you happy with the results?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have not, I have not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if you knew my wife, she would,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, she hasn't been happy with me up to this point,\n\nSpeaker 1: so no, I have not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, not a problem, because I do see\n\nSpeaker 1: that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not a specialist.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really, I don't know why that would happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, and like, when I filled out,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was for a one-time 10 pills, and I gave them\n\nSpeaker 2: to you my money, and so, yeah, I don't know\n\nSpeaker 1: what to do with what I just got in the mail\n\nSpeaker 2: from this Go-Go company or whoever that was from.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy, yeah, Go-Go Meds?\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can cancel your account, but I just want you to know\n\nSpeaker 2: that once I do, it will cancel your prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: with available refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other option you have, since we're not a subscription,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're really flexible with our customers\n\nSpeaker 2: as far as how they want to set up their account,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can always modify the frequency\n\nSpeaker 2: or put a pause on your account for up to six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: because once I cancel it, I don't even want an account.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: I purchased these to experiment and see\n\nSpeaker 2: what would even happen, but we don't know\n\nSpeaker 1: what's gonna happen, so, yeah, so, I don't, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not need an account, and I, yeah, so,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, whatever I gotta do.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, this package that I received in the mail the other day,\n\nSpeaker 1: I have to, can I send them back to you and not be charged?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't, there's no need for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I say, I was totally shocked.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife, what did you order?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I go, I didn't order anything, and so, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: so, I'm still in trouble.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sorry, well, here's what I'll do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just cancel your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you're not gonna receive\n\nSpeaker 2: any future orders or charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so, but what about this last one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did my, did my, I didn't, I didn't pull up my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did my card get hit again with your charges?\n\nSpeaker 2: For this last order, yes, so, if you wanna ship that\n\nSpeaker 1: back to us, we can issue you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me go get a pen and paper.\n\nSpeaker 1: My wife's in a, I don't know, hold on, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: To the, so, Gomez, that's where you're gonna send it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, to the address on the paperwork that was\n\nSpeaker 1: in the package?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, just send it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, oh, you're killing me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, let me go back upstairs.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I say, she's in a, she's worked from home\n\nSpeaker 2: and she's in a meeting, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, so, when I filled out all the information online,\n\nSpeaker 2: it was a one-time 10-tablet, non-prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, a non, yeah, you put this on me without knowing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what confuses me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the system has already set up your account like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, you can always be modified or change or pause,\n\nSpeaker 1: but like I said, you can send it back\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll issue you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, just send it back to the address\n\nSpeaker 2: on the prescription label and then once the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: receives it back, they'll put a note on your account\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we can issue you a refund, okay, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: And how long does that take?\n\nSpeaker 2: God, it's, you're, I gotta go through this on my end\n\nSpeaker 1: when it's your fail, you're, I don't know why\n\nSpeaker 2: you would do this to people.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how else to help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're, all right, all right, well, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: so cancel any, erase me from your, well, don't,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I want you to re-credit my freaking card\n\nSpeaker 1: because it's not an open card to ya.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so just send it back and we'll issue a refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, I'll be watching.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you, sir, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you as well, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
