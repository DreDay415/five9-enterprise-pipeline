    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I've been sent the wrong product twice now. I ordered the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: JT France, 6-28-64.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Okay, so I am looking at your profile, JT.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you do receive Viagra AGV, a quantity of 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you say you received the wrong stuff this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Both times.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm getting the generic...\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the pills with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I do. I'm looking at the bottle right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, the bottle itself should say Greenstone LLC on it since these are made in the lab facility.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the easiest way to make sure that you got the AGV is by taking a look at the capsules.\n\nSpeaker 1: They should have the number 50 engraved on them. Can you verify that for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on just a second. It says right on the bottle, generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you take a look at the pills? They should have the number 50 engraved on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 3-3-9.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yes. It looks like they did send you the classic Viagra and not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, don't worry about it. I'll notify the pharmacy so that they reship the correct order to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they should be sending you a quantity of 20 this time to make up for the previous order too, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, these are white.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they're supposed to be white. They're not going to be blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, the blue dye is bad for you, so we don't do them blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the AGV will be white also?\n\nSpeaker 1: It will be white, yes. But the reason, the way you'll be able to identify that it's the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's because it will say Greenstone LLC on the label.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then every single pill will have the number 50 engraved on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're welcome. Have a good day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, ma'am. Bye.",
