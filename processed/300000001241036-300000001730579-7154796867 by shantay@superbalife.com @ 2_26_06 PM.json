    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, did I just talk to you a second ago?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was in you and said his name was Charles that I had talked to earlier?\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, no, that was not me.\n\nSpeaker 1: That wasn't you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I talked to someone. I placed an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he screwed up. He put $50 too much on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was supposed to be $63, and he put an extra $50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But he said he'd charge it right back to my charge card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I checked with my charge, and he didn't do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the last lady I just talked to, she said it was Charles,\n\nSpeaker 2: and she put me on hold to talk to Charles, and I waited 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: He never answered.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got to talk to him because I'm going to have to disconnect that charge,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm going to have to get it wiped off my credit card if you don't call me back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because he said he had charged it.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said I made him charge it back right away on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: He was on the phone call, so that's probably why you were waiting.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you do it again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because he didn't charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said he made a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was supposed to be $63, and it's $113.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said I immediately made it charge back to your charge card.\n\nSpeaker 2: He did not do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's still $113.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Richard Dolezalek.\n\nSpeaker 1: D-O-L-E-Z-A-L-E-K, senior.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's still on the call, but I see that he did charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: He refunded you $50.\n\nSpeaker 2: How come it doesn't show up on my charge card?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it's not going to show up instantly.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will take some time for it to appear, but he did do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but they told me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, they told me that it should have showed up right away if he charged it back right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because it went through as a refund, and a refund takes a few days for it to go back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that one is a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not a charge back then.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's not a voided charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it was a voided charge, yes, it would have been done, like, within a couple of hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I wish he would have voided it rather than refunding, doesn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll wait and see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Either way, I'll have to dispute that charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll have to have my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you don't have to dispute it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guarantee you it was done.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: He did it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I don't want to wait too long, though, and then all of a sudden say, oh, we can't do nothing now, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, why would we do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: We won't do that to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was an accident on his behalf, which he corrected.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was an accident, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to make sure it doesn't come off, though, because I didn't want to pay $113 for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not going to hold you obligated to pay that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so everything is okay, then, you're telling me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then I won't worry about it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, don't worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give it a few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks a million.\n\nSpeaker 2: I figured, kind of.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was hoping for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks a million.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
