It looks like the doctor approved it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it says it's at the pharmacy, so they'll be shipping it out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if there's a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, there's no tracking number. They'll be shipping it out to you today or Monday morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem. It was just saying that they needed something else and I couldn't get into it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Nope, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
