    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first name, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is James Grooms.\n\nSpeaker 1: James Green?\n\nSpeaker 2: Grooms, G-R-O-M-E-S. I'm registered with you guys. I have a prescription that you've been sending me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send it to you. I have the number if you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-uh.\n\nSpeaker 1: I found it, Mr. Grooms.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, you're okay. What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, 1-1-2-0-5.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I want to ask you is about the new, the A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do you want to switch to the A-G-V?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me go ahead. Do you want me to place the order for you now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I have a credit card registered with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You sure do. Bear with me a moment. Do you still want to do the 10 pills? It's the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can get it for you for the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sure. Are you at 185 Hall Street, Unit 406 in Brooklyn, New York, 1-1-2-0-5?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm still there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, super. And then the credit card on file is an Amex ending in 7-0-0-8. Is that the card we should use?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I think so, but, you know, somebody's been trying to use some of my cards, so I had some cards replaced.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if it's one of those cards.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you try it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me try it, and then if it doesn't work, you're welcome to switch it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, one moment. And, again, it's 100 milligrams. Now you're getting the A-G-V. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It declined, so I would need a different card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me try to get one out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to have to bear with me now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's try this card here. Are you ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: The number is 3-7-9-2-4-6-2-5-5-6-5-4-0-0-8.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration is 11-30.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the security code, four digits.\n\nSpeaker 2: Security code, four digits is 5-0-0-7.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're all set. It's been shifted. Your prescription now reflects the A-G-V, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, expect it in the mail in the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye-bye.",
