I can help you, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatever works better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I had ordered some pills that made me really dizzy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he sent me some that he said might be better, but they weren't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Was it you I talked to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, I said, anyway, um, I just wanted to say that I don't need any more pills\n\nSpeaker 2: since you take my name, unsubscribe me, or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to try anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that's your first time taking Viagra, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then did you take Cialis in the past? Was Cialis a better fit for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: He sent me something different, and it wasn't any better.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I see what he's saying, but the two calls is usually either Viagra will help you or Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 1: because they work more differently, so that's why I'm trying to evaluate\n\nSpeaker 2: what would be a better fit to help you, basically,\n\nSpeaker 1: because apparently the Viagra is not for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you say that even the replacement didn't work,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm trying to kind of evaluate what would be a better help, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't know if you had Cialis in the past.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the same problem with Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: Cialis, I'm just trying to understand a little bit more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I tried two different ones. I don't know what they were,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I tried two different ones, and they both made me really dizzy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm 80 years old, so maybe I'm just too old to take that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I see. I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you know, I wouldn't say to give up on it, maybe here and there,\n\nSpeaker 2: but, you know, your account was paused,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can reorder as needed in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think they're paused for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want to keep it paused just in case you need something?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. No, I'm just not going to try it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. I'm going to cancel everything. It's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just be aware of possible price change.\n\nSpeaker 1: If anything changes, try to reorder. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm canceling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Don't send me anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I got you, Mr. Turner.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You're welcome. Bye-bye.",
