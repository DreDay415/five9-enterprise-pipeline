Maybe you use a different one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, 9-0-9-9.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. Can you say that? Can you restart over for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on. Let me check the probability. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a 9-0-9-9.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you give me the phone number?\n\nSpeaker 1: 5-0-2-3-0-2-9-0-9-6.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-0-9-9.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Newbolt?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so I see you have a prescription for Viagra and a milligram 10 tablet from Dr. Lowe every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you call through e-mail or did you call somebody?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I did. I did it through e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's why. I'm glad that you're calling so we can take your business properly because e-mail, there is no AI, so they go one by one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes it can get lost. So any health concern or you just want to order yourself?\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't want them to do the 30 days refill. You just want to order as needed yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't want my card charged no more, but unfortunately, my card got charged again after I put in to get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm saying. That was refilled with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't need it, I can advise the pharmacy that Mr. Newbolt rather order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: He don't need it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe he might get it once or twice a year, but not every month anymore, and you're going to call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have that option.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to go based on what the doctor wrote initially.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just initial writing for the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to go based on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can tell the pharmacy that you know they're active and you still have care left, so you're just going to call yourself to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but shit, I'm still out of my money because y'all took it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because the way they write, because everybody be rushing.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's bullshit.\n\nSpeaker 2: 95%, that's how they did it though.\n\nSpeaker 1: You get refilled and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, well take my card off of there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want my, I only want to, if I call and order it myself, then I don't want no monthly shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tell them to stop, advise them to stop so they can pause the prescription and you can order as needed basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way you lock your price.\n\nSpeaker 1: But please don't, I'm telling you, I do not want my, yeah, I don't want my card charged again unless I call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything will be paused.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can get, if you want to maintain that price, just get two refill a year and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they're not going to charge you on a monthly anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to tell them that you don't need it as often.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are probably going to call when you need it because you have some left of what you already ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want it at all unless I call and ask for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want them to charge my card no more unless I call.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want it two months down the line.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it three months down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Only when I actually call and say I need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want my card charged two or three months down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do not want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the same thing I was saying, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it seems that we don't understand each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to cancel your prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything will be canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, you might not be able to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you do, price is going to be up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm just telling you I'm going to pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I guess we don't understand each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it sounded like you were telling me that possibly longer than 30 days that I would get it or some shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I was saying is you get paused for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Moving forward, there is no more monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You get your refill once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not anymore on a monthly basis anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't even want the half-a-year deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want it to only on a I-call basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I was saying that I'm going to have to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the way they work their policy, you might not be able to reorder or the price will be up.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm okay with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: The consultation is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: VIP accounts is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I hear.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because six months down the line, I don't want my card charged again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, everything is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, you might not be able to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or if you do, price is going to be up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't get them from y'all.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's other websites that offer the same deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I won't be missing out on nothing if I do need it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
