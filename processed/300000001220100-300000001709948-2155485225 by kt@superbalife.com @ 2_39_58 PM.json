    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Robert, so the name's K.T. Goodrich, my extension is 0037, just think of a secret\n\nSpeaker 2: agent, 0037, I'll be your Viagra agent, alright?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did is exactly what you wanted, but never ever wait in line again, when you\n\nSpeaker 2: call back, deal with me, my fingerprints are on this, I take a lot of pride.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did is I did exactly what you wanted, the first thing I did was I put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 2: any monthly refills, I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, and I put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 1: any and all monthly charges, and I put a stop to this one that was trying to be sent out\n\nSpeaker 2: and I credited your account, which you should see immediately or within a 24 hour period.\n\nSpeaker 1: In light of all this, what I also did is I took it one step further, I elevated you to\n\nSpeaker 2: the elite status where when you go to scoreblue.com and you log in with your AOL account, you're\n\nSpeaker 1: going to click the top right buttons on the screen and you're going to go to a category\n\nSpeaker 2: that says your prescription, in that category you're going to see a red button with white\n\nSpeaker 1: font that says quick refill, anytime, anywhere, any place, you can get exactly what you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now if these are too strong and you need something less potent, let me know, I can\n\nSpeaker 1: always do the replacement, but let's cross that bridge, let's cross that bridge, what\n\nSpeaker 2: you do decide and let me know, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you tell me in the past what they sent me, because the funny thing is, I know the\n\nSpeaker 2: credit card I used for the original first order, and I just verified on that card that\n\nSpeaker 1: it was charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's what I'm saying, I reversed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, not the one today. My original order was on 12-28.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 12-26 on our end, 12-28 on your end.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, but that's why I'm questioning it, because I used the credit card the first time\n\nSpeaker 2: and the credit card has a 12-28 date, then the account that you used today, my PayPal\n\nSpeaker 1: account, also has a negative 63-95, so it looks like it was billed twice for the first\n\nSpeaker 2: order, once on my credit card and once on my PayPal.\n\nSpeaker 1: I only see, so just so we're aligned and we can be, you know, go case by, I mean situation\n\nSpeaker 2: by situation, on 12-26 you were charged for the first order, which should have taken like\n\nSpeaker 1: you said two days, but this next charge, right, I just reversed, so you should see\n\nSpeaker 2: a negative, it shows a negative, but if you refresh your screen on your PayPal, you'll\n\nSpeaker 1: see it's credited back, it should go back immediately.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so leave today out, leave today's order out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, copy that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so my first, I have on a credit card, which I'm going to open up right now, it happens\n\nSpeaker 1: to be on a PenFed credit card, there's a 63-95 order, that's score blue, and I can give you\n\nSpeaker 2: the transaction number, and it says PayPal, oh, you know, oh, it got maybe, it went through,\n\nSpeaker 1: no, no, no, forget, I'm talking about my original, my original one says it went through, it went\n\nSpeaker 2: through PayPal, but why is it on this credit card?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what happens is your credit card is connected to PayPal, whenever you use your PayPal, your\n\nSpeaker 2: PayPal pulls from your credit card, not us.\n\nSpeaker 1: But why, so why am I, right, but I'm showing, I think I have that transaction on both ends,\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why that is, that you would have to contact PayPal, usually this is what happens\n\nSpeaker 1: with PayPal, what I found, that PayPal and Uber and Lyft, and like Uber Eats are doing,\n\nSpeaker 2: this is what they're doing, they charge you twice, they get you your product, whether\n\nSpeaker 1: it be food or your car, and they've been doing double charges nowadays, because some people\n\nSpeaker 2: lie, they think they don't have any money on their PayPal, so they charge both, just\n\nSpeaker 1: in case your money doesn't suffice, they want to ensure that they get one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right, so the funny thing is, is I know that I use the credit card, but the funny,\n\nSpeaker 1: so how do they get to PayPal?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think that's...\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't, I don't know, you would have to contact PayPal, but here's the, here's what I do have.\n\nSpeaker 2: On 12-26, it was 63.95, which you confirm on 12-28 was charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, on 1-27, you were billed for that refill, but I reversed that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right, so that's fine, so I, so should I call the credit card, or should I call PayPal,\n\nSpeaker 1: because...\n\nSpeaker 2: I think you would call PayPal, because PayPal is the one that, what we found in the past,\n\nSpeaker 1: PayPal and all these other .com companies, they double charge people, especially if you're\n\nSpeaker 2: not a frequent flyer with PayPal, if you don't have money in there already.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you just bill it, if you just put it through, you pass it through to your credit card, they'll\n\nSpeaker 1: bill you twice for the same charge to ensure that they get at least one, and then when\n\nSpeaker 2: one clears, they will credit you back that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so the PayPal...\n\nSpeaker 2: So just wait, yeah, so just wait, you don't waste your time, but either way...\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm not talking the one, I'm not talking the one today, I'm talking the one back in\n\nSpeaker 2: December.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, correct, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you would call PayPal and be like, hey, listen, I've got this one, I'm gonna try it\n\nSpeaker 1: out, why'd you guys bill me twice for this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because they didn't, we didn't, and the way to do this is, check this out, Robert, when\n\nSpeaker 1: you go to scoreblue.com, right, and you go to the category, your receipts, there's a\n\nSpeaker 2: category we have on your dashboard as receipts, you'll see exactly what we charge and what\n\nSpeaker 1: we refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very clear, it's very simple, you only have two transactions with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know what, hold on, you know what I'm saying now, but it can make it very confusing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, well, this might be the one you just did, I see they don't give you, they tell me there's\n\nSpeaker 2: a negative here, but they don't give you, it says transaction help, they show a refund,\n\nSpeaker 1: but they don't, they don't tell you the date, so I don't know if this is the new one, the\n\nSpeaker 2: old one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, a lot of times, you would just have to sit back and wait, and then chase that again.\n\nSpeaker 1: That gets exhausting.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the same thing with my Apple Pay.\n\nSpeaker 1: With my Apple Pay, for example, just to enlighten what you're saying, with my Apple Pay, I'll\n\nSpeaker 2: put like 50 bucks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Apple Music and Grok, you know, Tesla doesn't charge my Apple Pay all the time, but they\n\nSpeaker 1: double charge me, instead of 30 bucks, they took 60 bucks, and I'm like, what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I have to just, because calling these guys, these dot com guys don't even have a\n\nSpeaker 2: customer service, they don't even answer the damn phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so I have your number, 0037, I didn't even try the product, so I will give you a\n\nSpeaker 2: call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And let me know, green light, red light, and then if there's too strong, we can, go\n\nSpeaker 1: ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a scoreboard, a score, what's it called, score, what's your company called?\n\nSpeaker 2: ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 1: ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there an app, instead of going to the website?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so download the app on Play Store, or ScoreBlue.com, ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there's an app, and it'll, alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I don't think I set up a password or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just use your telephone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, use my phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me just double check.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, let me double check.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do it on my phone right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: ScoreBlue, because I'm not on the tech, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 1: ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to see if our app is still active.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, our app isn't active, so just go to ScoreBlue.com on your browser.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so there is no app, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We deactivated our app because of cyber security, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've got to be very, very careful, because there's a company that's called Blue Chew.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye-bye.",
