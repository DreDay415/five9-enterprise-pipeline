    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jeff Highfield.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. Mr. Highfield, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 74002.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment. Let me locate your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You received your mail at P.O. Box 116 in Barnstall, Oklahoma, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you recently got another shipment?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I did. I was wondering, because I ordered, the first time I ordered 25 and then they sent me 25 again here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was wondering what the deal is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what happened?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a plan where it's going to keep sending them every couple of months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, let me make sure that you're not on that. I can make sure that this is – you prefer it at will, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just order whenever you feel like it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Okay, let me do that for you. Let's see here. And you have two options.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just so you know, to keep your prescription active as well as your VIP status, you can choose – we can pause this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically what it means is when we pause it, it becomes at will. You place an order whenever you want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't get wacky stuff in the mail and all that fun stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, to keep the prescription active, you get one refill at the end of six months if you do not place a refill, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you don't get any other refills at the end of six months, you get one refill to keep your prescription active. Okay? Is that all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah. I just don't want them to go into waste because right now I'm having trouble with my girlfriend's menopause issues.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not getting to take them very often. I don't want them – I think it's been – yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I didn't know whether I had to go about it. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. If you want the next refill, I can just reduce it to ten so that way you don't get stockpiled.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way in six months if you don't place an order, you just get ten pills but instead of 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that way it keeps everything active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. That would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Super. All right. We'll do that then. You are all set, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. That'll do it. I appreciate your help. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good day, sir. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
