    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what? My name is Phil Kennedy. I called and ordered the—\n\nSpeaker 1: You called it bag or something. What was the letters after that?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you're the newest formula from Pfizer, it's the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now, let me ask you something.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife seen it on the email and says I already ordered that. I have this and it's called sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligram generic for Viagra. Is that the same stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: So sildenafil is the leading ingredient in the original Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the right ingredient in generics and it's also the lead ingredient in the AGV now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the inactive ingredients in each of these that make it a little bit different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you order the AGV? Yes, I do is what you're thinking. Okay. Well, sir—\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull up your prescription here and what's the, yeah, digging and see exactly what you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yeah, 'cause I got three bottles of this already. I don't want to—I don't want to duplicate what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so could you get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Phil Kennedy, C-A-I-N, I-D-Y.\n\nSpeaker 2: For 1256.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you, Phil.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I do see here the prescription was written by the doctor for a quantity of 25 of the 100 milligram Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what's going—there's going to be a few differences with this pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you by chance get the generic through sildenafil through Score Blue or through your home—\n\nSpeaker 1: Position?\n\nSpeaker 2: Rex MD was okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've never worked with the Rex MD in particular.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the biggest thing to look at with these pills is to know where they're coming from, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So AGV stands for authorized Viagra from France. Okay, so that's made under Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the new pills themselves that you're receiving will say Greenstone on the bottom, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the laboratory that's coming from, that's based in France and that's under Pfizer. That's how you—\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you double-check the authenticity and the quality.\n\nSpeaker 1: Second, these pills will have the milligram dosage on them. So yours will say 100 most of the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Generic sildenafil coming from the United States or Mexico has a code on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have your current prescription from the other company?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hold on. I'm opening the bottle right now. Okay, then I'll look.\n\nSpeaker 1: The oval pill has a code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, three four three, hold on, and then the round pill—\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the same thing. It has a code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. So that's how you know it's from a generic company that isn't authorized by the original patent.\n\nSpeaker 1: When it has a milligram dosage, that's how you know it's coming from the original producer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So these new pills will look different and be coming from a different place.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, it's kind of like, you know—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's—I'm just saying it's produced differently while it says sildenafil on it because that is the leading ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 1: There are other things in there that make it different. For the case of the AGV, the—\n\nSpeaker 2: Inactive ingredients make it break down faster, stays in your system longer, and also there's little to no side effects compared to the others.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hmm, well, I'm wondering if it's going to be any better than this.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's—\n\nSpeaker 1: Most patients that we have here at Score Blue, because we prescribe generic Viagra, we prescribe the TV, and we prescribe—\n\nSpeaker 2: Name brand, the blue pill, right? All of these options have different costs.\n\nSpeaker 1: So really, you know, you're paying for what you get for, right? Compared to generic and then the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So most of our patients that have been prescribed generics in the past are moving over to the AGV because they're that happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, then I'll leave it go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, sir. Thank you.",
