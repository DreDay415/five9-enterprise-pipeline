    "text": "Speaker 1: Sarge? Sergeant Joe? Yes sir. So thanks for holding. So I did exactly what you wanted and more but\n\nSpeaker 2: so I got in front of it too. So I did three things and just hear me out but the first\n\nSpeaker 1: thing I did and I got my fingerprints on this so deal with me moving forward. So\n\nSpeaker 2: the first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills. The second\n\nSpeaker 1: thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments. And the third\n\nSpeaker 2: thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I pause your\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription and I credit back your $63.95. So you should get that\n\nSpeaker 2: immediately. Now if it doesn't come immediately give it a couple hours\n\nSpeaker 1: because depending on your bank and our bank sometimes they don't sync and it\n\nSpeaker 2: needs about a few hours to 24 hours at best okay. But I'm gonna show you how to\n\nSpeaker 1: confirm that. And in light of all this I did my due diligence and I dug deeper in\n\nSpeaker 2: your chart and I elevated this. So I sent the message on your behalf and our\n\nSpeaker 1: behalf to Dr. Paul Drummerbean and I'm taking the liberty to send you 20\n\nSpeaker 2: pills for the other pills that didn't work and no charge. I'm billing Dr.\n\nSpeaker 1: Drummerbean for this but I'm giving you something that will work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Something a little more powerful because something for men like you and I\n\nSpeaker 1: we've been through some stuff. We've seen it all you know and not all but enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we we're not trying to go into battle with our gun jam and shooting a\n\nSpeaker 1: Daisy BB gun. We need like a Dirty Harry you know. We need 335, 338\n\nSpeaker 2: balling or AR-15 with a scope. Even without the scope I don't give a damn.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just shave and flush them out you know. I'm sending you 20 to make you\n\nSpeaker 2: whole. So what in light of this this means your December and your January are\n\nSpeaker 1: whole. These are going to be beautifully wonderfully powerful. Please Sarge do not\n\nSpeaker 2: take them with any alcohol, tobacco, even caffeine. No tomahawk, ribeye because it's\n\nSpeaker 1: a sensitive time-release and the way it works is when you take it with\n\nSpeaker 2: water on a light diet like veggies or fruits it'll activate in 15 to 30\n\nSpeaker 1: minutes. It'll go 6 to 8 hours right. So the only challenge you'll have with\n\nSpeaker 2: this is two things. One you might baptize the woman and her soul might leave her\n\nSpeaker 1: body or two you're only going to do menage a trois. You know what I mean. So it's all up to you bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to do what's right and and if it's any consolation to you bud just\n\nSpeaker 1: take down my name and my number and then the last thing bud. If you can just\n\nSpeaker 2: text yourself it's KT Goodrich like Kilo Tango and Goodrich is entire right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then my extension is 0 0 3 7. Now did you call the pharmacy or did you\n\nSpeaker 2: call the 9807 number? I called support. Okay so it was that 1-800-675-9807? I can tell you exactly what it was for the one second. It was 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 1: So next time you call that just dial 0 0 3 7 0 0 3 7. You'll always get me Sarge. So just don't ever leave a message because I use the restroom a lot or I'm on a late call. Just tell the colleagues like hey this is Sergeant Sales and here's my number. Just tell them to call me. KT will call me back. He always does. I will call you back that hour or that day before I even leave. I'll make it right bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay so the last thing I did bud is I set up a button. When we cross this bridge if you give me the thumbs up and you say the next few months because we have time to figure this out right. We have about six months to figure it out. If you decide that you want to go through with it, you call me. Let me know that it's a thumbs up and in the future the way we'll set it up is when you go to scoreblue.com and you log in right with your\n\nSpeaker 1: yahoo right. You're going to log in with your yahoo. You're going to log in with that yahoo. You're going to go to a category that says receipts. In that category you'll see the amount refunded and then you're going to see the amount that is at the pharmacy. It only says 10 pills but they're going to be 20. They're going to look the same but the difference is that etching is going to say 1 0 0.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay that's the difference okay. It's not going to say AC 340. Now when you go to the category Sarge that says your prescription, you're going to see two buttons in about an hour. One is going to be a red button that says quick refill and the other button that says track. Now you can track your package and then you can also click your button to get a refill at your command.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay no blind timing. At your command. Just know that the only caveat is you have to maintain 20 pills a year or every 6 months or whatever. So let's just say in 6 months or 5 months you want a refill. You click the button. It pushes out the timer another 6 months. So you still have control of it. Now if you don't, if you're like flying and all that. Let's just say you forget about it. It comes automatically only twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all. But that's not going to happen until you give me the thumbs up in a few weeks and you let me know first. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And say your, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah I was just saying say your phone number and that extension one more time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay so 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9807.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah and then my extension is 0037. And my name is K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: But and you're out there in, um, let me see. You're out there in Mississippi. K.T. Goodrich. Sarge you're out there in Mississippi. You're near North Carolina and South Carolina, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Dude, I've been listening. I'm going to ask you a favor one day, you know. I've been missing my brother since 2007 and he moved to South Carolina. I'm going to put out some ads in the future to look for him, you know, because I'm in my 50s, bud, but it's been since 2007 I haven't seen him. And he moved there and he's been missing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know. I'll figure it out. But one thing at a time, you know, I'll keep your name and I got to call like all the precincts. I got to call everything, right? I got to know how to do it though. Like I think I have to call like all the hospitals, right? Call all the precincts. Put out an ad. Call the hospitals. All of that, you know. And then I'll put out ads on Facebook.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll share with you later. You know, I feel like I've kind of known you, you know, and you know, like, you know, I just, I want to do what's right. And I want to see that guy. I always told him, you know, when we were orphans that, you know, we'll never be apart. But when I, when I, when I went to Vietnam for work and in China, like I left him in Seattle and then he moved to South Carolina in Spartanburg, but, but anyhow.\n\nSpeaker 2: But so anyhow, like I, I just wanted to share that, you know, cause it was on my heart, but nevertheless, you know, Sarge, I made you whole. You got 20 kills on your way. You got the 5395. Everything's in whole. You have my name and my number. If you can't, call your bank and just let them know that we're good. We took care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you don't have to dispute or do anything like that. That way they don't put any blemishes on our names. You know, you don't lie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, sometimes things get done. Computers make mistakes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I definitely didn't want to tarnish y'all because, I mean, you know, heck, that's how, you know, you, you make a, you make a living off them and this, that and everything. So we, we don't want them, you know, ever to say, okay, we need to downsize or whatever, because I've, I've been a part of a downsize before I came to work here in law enforcement to where it was like, you know, just due to complaints, due to complaints.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, and, and it, and it just made them, made them shrink and, and it involved me and I, I, and it hurt.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, but it could be.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you don't, you don't see your benefit of the doubt as good because hurt people hurt people, bud. You know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hurt people hurt people. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And a lot of times they're just sick and they're not even conscious of it. You know, they're, they don't even know, you know, cause they're sociopaths, narcissists, you know, all this stuff, man, society, man, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: May God keep you safe, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: May God keep you safe, alive, healthy, strong every day, Sarge, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Well, I do thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's how we roll, bud. We're Americans, bud. We're, you know, we bleed red, white, and blue and that's how we roll through the day we die, bud. All the way through, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you have a blessed rest of your day, too. Thank you for doing this, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, of course, bud. You're very welcome. Keep in touch, all right? And I'll do the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call me anytime. Good, bad, ugly. If you need anything, Sarge, just call me and be like, hey, man, KT, what's going on? But give me the heads up in a couple weeks. Let me know, like, hey, man, KT, these are the thumbs up, man. You know, whatever it is, you know, just don't be a stranger, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just let me know. Thumbs up, thumbs down, all right? We'll be good. We'll give each other's back, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. All right. Adios, sir. Take care. God bless. Godspeed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
