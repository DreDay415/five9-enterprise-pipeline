That's just the initial—\n\nSpeaker 2: Prescription. I can advise the pharmacy to put a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that we're just going to order as needed instead, so that locks your price in. The only thing is you don't get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we feel—\n\nSpeaker 1: You—\n\nSpeaker 2: Understand that I would like to cancel it completely, completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'm canceling you completely. You know, just be advised, you know, if anything's changed because you're not gonna have that consultation—\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just canceling that right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing is the price change if the company got to get you a new doctor—\n\nSpeaker 1: Consultation to serve you, price will be different just in case you see a price difference or you're not able to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because of the consultation, because I can't sell that consultation right now and your account as well. Okay, you all said Mr. Quinn?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, I can give you a cancellation number if you like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, the number three, the letter C like Charlie, the number seven, the letter D like dog—\n\nSpeaker 1: The number four, six, B like boy, A—\n\nSpeaker 2: Like—\n\nSpeaker 1: Aviation, the number two, and the letter C like Charlie.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.",
