    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, I have a question. I just received another order from you, and I didn't order anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess this is some kind of auto program that you got me signed up for, but I don't have anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I want something, I place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have any auto program, you need to cancel it and return my money to this order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Mr. Jerry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I think what happened was the refill, but what I'm going to do, I'm going to pause your prescription because you don't need it as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just write refuse return to those PL, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm starting the refund process, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What do you want me to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just put refuse return on the package. That's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you open it, tape it nicely in the back, put it back in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: When the mailman sees that, he's going to understand that's not for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's got to send that back to the source where it came from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just open the top. I'll take it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: The driver didn't even know what it was, so I'll put it back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do it nicely.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm pausing the prescription for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way you don't get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: They pause you up to half a year if you get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't need any auto refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Be aware of the price change, okay, when you reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm going to have to cancel the prescription they finance for you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I'm not pausing you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when they refinance that again,\n\nSpeaker 2: they got to apply that to the cost of your medication, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay. And so what's the amount of my refund on this?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, we'll go back in the mailbox, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and you want to cancel your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't want to pause it, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want anything if I called and ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the only way, because I got to let you know that that's really important,\n\nSpeaker 1: the only way for you to maintain your price is to pause the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: As far as it goes, it's half a year, and then you get the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you get another refill half a year after that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the minimum.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if you cancel the prescription, which is fine, I don't mind doing that,\n\nSpeaker 2: the only difference, I got to let you know that,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that they're going to reinvest, get a new doctor evaluation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you're restarting over.\n\nSpeaker 1: That being said, price will be up.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the only difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now it's up to you, whatever works best for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't mind doing either or.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't care if I cancel or I pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you cancel, you lose the prescription they finance.\n\nSpeaker 2: And every time they got to refinance your new doctor evaluation.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because they got to legally have a doctor evaluation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so why can't you just pause it, and if I want to order something, I'll pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, that's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I offer to pause you so you can reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, just pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I want something, I'll call you, but if I don't call you, don't send me nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you pause it, you get to refill half a year from now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unless you call to change that refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's say I put you off until July 21st.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can move that around, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you got to have a date to lock the price in some way somehow.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't care about the price as long as you don't send me anything unless I order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, if I don't order, don't send me anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to have to cancel then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, then cancel, whatever you have to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, everything I've been canceled, like I said, be aware of price change, but you're all set, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just return that for the refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to refund you, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Refuse return on it, and we're going to refund you, and everything's canceled here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you want me to try to return to sender right on the front label here?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, we'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you need anything else?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.",
