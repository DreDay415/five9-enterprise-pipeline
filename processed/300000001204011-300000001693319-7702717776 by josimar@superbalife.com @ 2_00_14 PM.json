    "text": "Speaker 1: Vazos, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hey, I had bought some of the pills from you guys back in October of last year. And I tried them, and I didn't like them, and I returned them. And I never got my money back. I was wondering if you could help me out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could take a look into your profile. What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 30518.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Kimbrough, K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your first name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tom.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, hold it up here. Let me see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you were already refunded, sir, back on November 5th. It should have already hit your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where did it go?\n\nSpeaker 1: It went to a MasterCard. I recommend looking into that and calling your bank to verify where those funds, but that was already refunded to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what's the last four of the MasterCard number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it just tells me it's a MasterCard, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it was returned when, November?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it was refunded November 5th, but most likely it hits your account November 10th or 11th. It takes like four to five business days to reflect.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, well, I'll double check that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.",
