    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to cancel any subscription. I never subscribed in more than one order, but I got another order and bill which I didn't request.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me pull up your account and see what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: First, could I get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Richard Bright.\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-2-5-7.\n\nSpeaker 1: Richard, I see your last order was...\n\nSpeaker 2: Refill was receiving the prescriptions written on December 21st for 100 milligram Viagra. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I didn't... I never ordered that.\n\nSpeaker 2: The most recent one you're saying is in January. Yeah, it looks like the doctor had written this with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so there's a total of 12 refills on the script once it's written.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not...\n\nSpeaker 1: Authorized to authorize them to multiple...\n\nSpeaker 2: Subscriptions and I didn't request that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So it is, you know, this is fixable.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I said you're not required to; it's just that's how they write it with the lower milligram dosages and quantities.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in your case with 100, they just wrote it with refills. It is adjustable though, Richard.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, this isn't a subscription. If you want, you can just pause it and then that would allow you to have access to...\n\nSpeaker 1: The remaining refills and call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I'm good for now. I just want to make sure that I don't receive any more or get billed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So yeah, upon cancellation you would lose access to this medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any future prescriptions would require a new health consultation and survey, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so just keep in mind. They're going to take a look here at your previous prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: There might be a little bit of a delay just because of the cancellation, but if you're okay with that I can cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, cancel. I don't want to...\n\nSpeaker 1: Receive any more and I don't want to be billed for another order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Yep. I'll go ahead and cancel it for you. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
