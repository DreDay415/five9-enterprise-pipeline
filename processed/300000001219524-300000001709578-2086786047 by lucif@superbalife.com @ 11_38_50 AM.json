I get it once, but they still charge me and\n\nSpeaker 2: sent me some bills, so I got to make sure they don't charge my card no more. I want\n\nSpeaker 1: it off file, actually.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And how exactly did you cancel this before?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know. They just, out of the blue, sent me some pills and called it my...\n\nSpeaker 2: You said that you canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I told them I didn't want them no more, and then a couple, three months later, they\n\nSpeaker 2: took that on my credit card, so I just wanted everything...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It looks like here, I do see the recorded call that you did when you called in, and\n\nSpeaker 2: it looks like you, because it all is transcribed, it looks like you spoke to the guy and you\n\nSpeaker 1: decided to pause for five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told them I'd send it back, and they would credit my... Yeah, I told them I'd send it\n\nSpeaker 1: back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But I do see a note that you spoke to someone, and you guys decided to pause it\n\nSpeaker 1: for five months and have time to use the product that you have, and call it...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I don't want it no more. I'm done with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I understand. So that's not what I'm describing. I'm describing that you was told that this\n\nSpeaker 2: was going to be paused for five months, and I see here that you did agree with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh. Well, I guess I misunderstood, because I wanted to pause until I was ready for some\n\nSpeaker 2: more if I want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. That's what was done for you, but...\n\nSpeaker 2: But I never called them and told them I wanted more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it doesn't last forever, so it does usually do that in six-month periods, so we\n\nSpeaker 2: can keep your prescription open for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. I want to cancel. I don't want them no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Well, you are already canceled, sir. Anything else that you need?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. So you've canceled me, and they won't be sending me no more, or trying to...\n\nSpeaker 2: You've actually been canceled since the 5th of this month. I believe you called already.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you call again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I called, but I didn't know if they got me canceled or what they got done. I just\n\nSpeaker 1: want to make sure it's done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I won't be getting no more pills, and they won't be sending me no more, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir. You will never receive this again. You are canceled, and your prescription is\n\nSpeaker 1: canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.",
