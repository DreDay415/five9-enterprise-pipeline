I'm just online trying to put an order in, put my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says my credit card is being charged, but I didn't okay it,\n\nSpeaker 2: or I'm just trying to see what the process is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well let me pull up your potential account here and see if something went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's John, K-O-H-N-O-B-I-D-O, 04-09-1957.\n\nSpeaker 2: So John, it looks like you did put your credit card information in and it was charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like a card – I'm pulling up the card information for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that was a MasterCard ending in 7-1-2-4?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. I just put the information in, but I didn't hit complete sell or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: So did you want this prescription, sir, or not?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I wanted to find out how long it would take to get it shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm out of state right now, that's why.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just wondering if I should wait until I get home or order it now?\n\nSpeaker 2: So this has been ordered, and you can probably expect it in about 5 business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the address that's on file is 1116 South Washington Street.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'll be gone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The best bet here is canceling it and then reordering it again later down the road\n\nSpeaker 2: when you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. How can I cancel it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do it for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and canceled that for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right then. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, you got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
