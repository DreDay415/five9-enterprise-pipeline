I'm having trouble hearing you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You asked for my last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, your last name and a zip code, so I can pull up the profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, my last name is Semino.\n\nSpeaker 1: C-I-M-I-N-O.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean district?\n\nSpeaker 2: I see your zip code.\n\nSpeaker 1: 50211.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I pulled up your profile here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, you're currently set up for every month of the refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like the doctor had put that on you when he initially made your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could always call us to modify it, but it looks like you weren't able to.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why you received another order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can make an adjustment to it now since it's already been sent.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'd like, we can cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But keep in mind, if we cancel it, you wouldn't be able to order\n\nSpeaker 2: because the doctor would delete the visit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or we can always just change you over to our six-month freeze plan where you could freeze it\n\nSpeaker 2: out and then give us a call when you need it or give us a call to delay it even further.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you can retain access to it for when you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was not working for me, so I do not want to order it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: That I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So go ahead and put a stop to your orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in mind that moving forward, you wouldn't be able\n\nSpeaker 1: to order these Viagras anymore, but you're all set, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Other than that, yeah, I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you have any other questions, feel free to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Did you cancel my order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I canceled the Sydney Future order, so you won't receive anything else moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
