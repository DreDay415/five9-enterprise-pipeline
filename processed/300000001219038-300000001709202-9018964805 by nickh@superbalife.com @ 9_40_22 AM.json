    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. I score blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was calling to cancel my subscription. I had I had chenna's email last month on the 24th, but I've still been charged on my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, I think I know what's happening here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, because it is the HIPAA rules.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do just need to confirm identity when canceling, so they may have responded with an email to call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let's get this taken care of now for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So sir, can I just get your full name and date of birth under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: James Jones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Date of birth 7-29-1966.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um.\n\nSpeaker 2: James, do you have multiple accounts by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it might be two.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because I see one that is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: From December 2025, and that was due—it looks like the doctor canceled it because, uh,\n\nSpeaker 1: They were just waiting on a response.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's another because I got a charge on the 12th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay, because this one, the last—that's like the one I'm looking at—is already closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now James, could you provide me your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-29-1966.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, there's quite a few James Jones on my profiles here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I see you here. All right. Yep, Tennessee. Okay, multiple couch.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I see the most recent one—the most recent one was for a quantity of 10 of 100 milligram Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that being said, I do see your prescription here was written with refills by the doctor on a monthly schedule.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not required to do this.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is by no means a subscription. If you wanted to keep access to the remaining refills, I see here—\n\nSpeaker 1: It's about nine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could simply just pause it, and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll no longer receive them monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, um.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just cancel it for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so upon cancellation you would lose access to the remaining refills. Any future prescriptions would require a new and separate health consultation.\n\nSpeaker 1: And approval.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would be potentially seeing some price increases because you're locked in at the VIP pricing from 2025 right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, when I took care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that is all I needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you're all set then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.",
