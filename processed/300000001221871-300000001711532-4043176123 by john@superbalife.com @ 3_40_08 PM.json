    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I was calling about ordering some more pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just need your name and zip code to start.\n\nSpeaker 2: Name is Eli, first name, last name, 04-T-R-O-F-O-R-T.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And the zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 03-0-1-T-7.\n\nSpeaker 1: 5349 Nearwood Place?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You want to do 25 pills again?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, question. How much is it for 25 pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: $113.95. It would be the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Now, do you have anything?\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have a few left, but I want to kind of stretch it with maybe getting a lower dosage to get more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, so we don't actually do it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like the amounts you can get are set regardless of the dose.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you want to stretch out your pills, if you cut each of those 100 milligrams you have in half,\n\nSpeaker 1: each half counts as 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I know. And I've been doing that, but I'm running out of those.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had another drug that wasn't as strong as what you guys have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. So, that way I can stretch out. So, what you guys have is really the best that I've had so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to get more to cut more in half, the most I can do is 40 right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The most you can do is how much?\n\nSpeaker 2: 40 pills. That's the biggest package we have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, but how much is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be $163 for that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: $163?\n\nSpeaker 2: $163.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, $163.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm going to come out better that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because then you'll get 80 pills, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: How do you figure that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you cut them all in half, then it's 80 to 60 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you cut them in half. Okay, right. Right, I get it. I get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, $163 or one, how much is it for the 25 that I get?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll get either or. I'm probably going to try to get the more, but let me just check my finances, and I'll give you guys a call back when I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sounds good, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
