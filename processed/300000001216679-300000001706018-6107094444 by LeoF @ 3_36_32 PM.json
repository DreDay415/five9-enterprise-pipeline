    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you doing? I am a little upset here at this point.\n\nSpeaker 1: I called after I finally got through to cancel my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I recently had surgery and I have some other medical stuff going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can no longer take your products.\n\nSpeaker 2: I kept texting and emailing to cancel my account and giving instructions to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would keep trying to call and no one was answering the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Finally, I got through and someone did answer the phone after I was on hold for 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said okay, no problem, we will cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said great, I really appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then they went ahead and they charged my account anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I got a message from someone by the name of Christy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know you guys may not use your correct names.\n\nSpeaker 2: Saying that if I get the product, I should send it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I shouldn't send it back to the post office because they may not get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The post office might lose it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a PO box. I don't know how I am supposed to send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: They don't send it back to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry about that. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. I'm highly medicated right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just had a knee replacement as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Bob. Last name is Frankenfield.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, Mr. Frankenfield.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have you there at 2035 Hutchinson Avenue, unit 133R.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you receive mail there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. 133R is a post office box.\n\nSpeaker 2: They do not deliver mail to my home.\n\nSpeaker 1: I get you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically, what the email is telling you to do is to write refuse return to sender\n\nSpeaker 1: and let the postal service know, hey, I'm refusing this order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it. Send it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: At that point, we definitely would credit the account the full amount.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason you were charged on the 21st, it just posted on the 22nd,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it went out that day after you called the agent.\n\nSpeaker 2: He did cancel the account out for you, but he wasn't able to stop it\n\nSpeaker 1: before it went out, it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do apologize about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should be able to refuse that order\n\nSpeaker 2: and definitely we'll give you a full refund on it\n\nSpeaker 1: and you won't get anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. The problem, though, if I may,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that I was trying to reach out to you guys in advance of this\n\nSpeaker 2: and I could never freaking get through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I get you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've been crazy slammed since the holidays.\n\nSpeaker 1: We sent a bunch of new advertisements out about our new bills\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the email team, they don't let us do the cancellations over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a different department.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's our way, unfortunately, is to have this whole thing unraveled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so even though Christy said,\n\nSpeaker 2: don't take it to the post office, I have to take it to the post office\n\nSpeaker 1: to return to you guys, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if it's from your P.O. box, just tell them,\n\nSpeaker 1: hey, I got this in my P.O. box, but I never wanted this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to refuse this order and send it back\n\nSpeaker 1: and they'll know what to do and it'll come back to us\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll definitely give you the full refund on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because what scares me, though,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I operate a non-profit homeless agency,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I know what the postal service is like\n\nSpeaker 2: and we deal with them a lot of times\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're a mess right now, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: When she said that they may not get it back,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm thinking, oh, man, you guys must have history\n\nSpeaker 2: with the postal system, the U.S. postal system,\n\nSpeaker 1: that they're not reliable and I don't want to send it back\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you guys tell me, hey, we never got it, dude,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I still get charged, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries. Go ahead and refuse that\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you can, have them just document that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll have like a return to sender processed\n\nSpeaker 1: on your tracking link to say, hey, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: when you refuse it, could you just, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: have that correspond to the tracking link\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we'll see that, even if it doesn't make it back,\n\nSpeaker 1: as long as we see that the return to sender is processed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that makes sense then, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, just go ahead and get that done for us\n\nSpeaker 1: and we will take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll see that in the next few days\n\nSpeaker 1: and then just refuse it, come right back,\n\nSpeaker 2: we'll get you that credit, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and I do appreciate you taking my call.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
