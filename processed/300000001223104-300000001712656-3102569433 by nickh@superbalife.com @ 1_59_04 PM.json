    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I was just checking on an order I had at Rush ordered that should be here by now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's take a look here and see what the delay is. Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael Bolton, 3967.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, so here's what's going on with your delivery, Michael.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because of the weather, I'm assuming this is why there's a delay on this with the storms just hitting right when you place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you, since obviously you won't be receiving it on time, I can issue a refund for that express shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: When will that get there?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, it's hard to say right now, obviously, with the weather, but I would assume either tomorrow or Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, so I'll go ahead and refund that express shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cool question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I used to get an email with a tracking number once it was en route. I never get that anymore. Are you guys still doing that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You probably, because what I'm seeing here is you keep doing the express shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: The express shipping doesn't use our typical shipping method.\n\nSpeaker 2: Traditionally, when you do your standard shipping, you get a tracking number via United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Regarding FedEx, when it's on FedEx, you won't get that email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's still going to go FedEx then, or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, FedEx has your package, but it's probably sitting on a tarmac somewhere because, obviously, flight's being delayed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
