My name is Leland Adams, and I've got my first prescription, and that's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wonderful, but I don't think I'm going to be doing any renewals or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know it's an automatic renewal, and I kind of want to be taken off that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Adams, we have your account paused until July, but you wanted to just go ahead—\n\nSpeaker 2: and cancel it outright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, cancel it outright. Honestly, I talked to my health care provider, and he's not—\n\nSpeaker 2: real big on me doing Sidelofil, due to my heart issues, and I did try it, and it's—\n\nSpeaker 1: not, I didn't really do anything different than anything else I've tried, so yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just, if I could get an email that said it's been canceled, that'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. I can take care of that for you, Mr. Adams. I did want to let you know that—\n\nSpeaker 2: we are the only FDA-approved vendor of the medicine, and when I do cancel it for you—\n\nSpeaker 1: I won't be able to reopen the prescription, so just wanted to make sure you were aware—\n\nSpeaker 2: okay? You could have to get the medicine elsewhere. It could be cheap pills from China—\n\nSpeaker 1: India, who knows where, but just wanted to let you know before I finalize the—\n\nSpeaker 2: cancellation for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine. Yeah, I know, but I might not be taking anything anyway, so do you have—\n\nSpeaker 2: my email address?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do, leadams50 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'd be great. If you could just send me something that said it's been done—\n\nSpeaker 1: because I don't need a surprise, you know, something taken out of my account in three—\n\nSpeaker 2: to six months from my drop, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. So I went ahead and canceled that. I sent you the confirmation email.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll see that any second, and you're all set then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
