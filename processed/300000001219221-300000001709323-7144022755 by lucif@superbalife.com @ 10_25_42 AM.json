    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello, I'm Jim Bright. I received an order yesterday from your company. When I received\n\nSpeaker 2: the first order, the product wasn't working for me, so you sent me a survey and I canceled\n\nSpeaker 1: a few of your orders, but I received an order yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm confused. We sent you a survey? Yeah, a survey about how it was working, this\n\nSpeaker 1: and that, and the other thing, a while back, I don't know, a month ago?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not familiar with that, but you said it wasn't working for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay, well, if it's not working for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so we can simply just, you know, send you something that works for you better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's okay. I just want to send this back, the one I got.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine, but we can also send you something else for free to see if it is working\n\nSpeaker 1: for you better. Okay. That'd be all right, maybe.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, how do I return this package?\n\nSpeaker 1: How you put or turn the sender on it. Okay. I did open it. I didn't know who it was from.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine. You can just try to, like, tape it up or close it the best you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. And then you'll refund me on my credit card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, correct. Okay. All right. So, that's easy enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: Were you interested in trying other bills? Yeah. You want to send something up for free,\n\nSpeaker 2: you said? Yeah, correct. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: we do ask that you do call us back and let us know that it is actually working for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, so we can pick back up. And that way, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're actually purchasing something that works for you in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, all right. Do you mind taking my extension?\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can call me back and let me know what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's your extension, buddy?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So, it's going to be the same phone number you have there,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's going to be 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0035. And your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Quinn. Say that again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Q-U-I. Okay. All right. All right. You got it, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'll be hearing from you soon, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. You, too.",
