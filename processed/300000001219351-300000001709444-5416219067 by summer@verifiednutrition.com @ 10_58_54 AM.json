If I order the Viagra, does that automatically put me on automatic shipments?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your account so I can see what kind of account you have. What's your name and birthday?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Dave Gutschus, G-U-C-H-E-S, 10-18-44.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if you do it over the phone, you don't have to be on an automatic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but if I do it on the computer, it's automatic?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't uncheck the box, it could possibly be automatic, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well then I need to, I don't have my wallet with me, so I need to change the credit card. So if I call again and order, it's not—and I know I'm repeating myself—but I don't want to get caught up in automatic shipments, if you know what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks for your patience with me. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, bye-bye.",
