I recently ordered a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I want to make sure that I'm not on auto retail. I want to make sure that I actually order when I...\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 11542.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what was your name again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name is Gladius. K-L-A-D-I-A-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: To Viola Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So if you don't have a refill date set, sir, in the future, you don't have to accept it on that day,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if you don't even have a date set, you wouldn't be able to order down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can do that for you, but this would be your one and only order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. For now, yes, because I'm going to Europe, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine. That's all fine, sir. There's just no for now. This was one and done now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're all set. Your prescription has been canceled because we covered the cost of the doctor's visit,\n\nSpeaker 2: and now we're not going to pay for that cost again since you canceled right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Account's closed. Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
