I sent emails back a...\n\nSpeaker 1: Couple of weeks ago, and I'm explicitly explaining that I do no longer want to do business with your company and...\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent an automatic shipment anyway, despite my request.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I charge my... well, if you don't mind me asking, what happened? You just don't need to refill at the moment?\n\nSpeaker 2: And you have concerned?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I am NOT happy. Order as needed if you like. I'm not happy with the service of the company.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just not... I'm not interested in doing business the way the business was handled.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so I see that...\n\nSpeaker 2: You had a prescription, Viagra 50 milligram for Dr. Strimbu, 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was, that's correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: The issue is the way they handled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't... I'm just not... I just don't like to do business the way they handled the business.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just not interested, and the prescription that they sent me was not what I asked for in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 1: So did you... and when I spent... if you've got a wrong order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I did, but they said that I cannot have... they cannot replace that. I can't get a refund or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I said, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: For you.\n\nSpeaker 1: To get...\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it doesn't matter at this point. I'm not interested anymore. I'm going to my doctor now, so he's going to handle...\n\nSpeaker 1: And have they shipped that last shipment out yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, they did.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, you can return it when you get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'd be happy to do that, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm placing notes here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Gary.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go over what we did today. You called to cancel your account saying that you didn't receive the proper med.\n\nSpeaker 2: I offered you to send you a replacement if you was any type of... you didn't receive what you ordered. You declined.\n\nSpeaker 1: Explained you that, you know, you had a prescription with refills and then you could pause that order as needed. You declined as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I canceled the doctor prescription, the finance for you here, and canceled your account and so you all said...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye. Have a good night.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
