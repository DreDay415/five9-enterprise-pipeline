    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is John Knapp, K-N-A-P-P. I just received a notice from PayPal that they sent me another order, which I did not request.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take a look into your account here. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Knapp, K-N-A-P-P. The zip code is 11777.\n\nSpeaker 1: Honestly, the last bottle they sent me, I haven't even used any of that, and they now are supposedly sending me another bottle, which I do not want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem. I can take a look into that for you. But just to confirm, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you by any chance get an opportunity to read the terms and conditions when you placed your initial order?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I put in the order, I paid for it, and that was it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yes, because you get that emailed out to you when you get the prescription approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically, every order comes with a set refill date based on the doctor's choice, because it needs that to become activated.\n\nSpeaker 1: On that aspect, though, it looks like the doctor sets you for every three months, which is why you got an order in February.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right now, it's still in the pharmacy, though, so I can cancel it out for you, and then we can...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, please, because I don't know who's going to take a hundred of those things in three months. If they are, they've got bigger problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no worries. Other than that, regarding your prescription, though, since I do see you're at a special rate,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the only way for the prescriptions to remain active is by having a refill date.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't mean you need to get the product, it just means it needs a refill date.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I could always do for you is freeze it out so that we have an opportunity to see if you even like these,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you can call us back once you try a few of them and make a final decision, and then I can go ahead and make a...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you could, I mean, even six months, I don't know if I could ever use what I have now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, yeah, yeah, of course. So just definitely just give it a try first. See if you're a fan of it at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: In a month or so, just call us and let us know if you want to continue with them or you want to just stop...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you'll cancel this other one that was... It says it charged me, but...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it charged me already, and it's at the pharmacy. I canceled it, and we issued a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: It takes three to five business days to process through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll see that refund, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, I did freeze it out for any other orders, but just call us once you try a few so you can make a final decision.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will. All right. Thanks so much. I'll keep this number. Thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day now. Bye-bye.",
