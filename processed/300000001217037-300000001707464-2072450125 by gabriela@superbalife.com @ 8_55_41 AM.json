I don't know where it went.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it doesn't show that we have received it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So to make things easier for you and for us, I'll have the doctor give you a call instead, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you do that, or if you want to send me a link, I can try again.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, that would be better to have the doctor call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'll just notify the doctor so that he can give you a call, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
