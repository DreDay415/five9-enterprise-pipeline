    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, good morning. I see you guys sent my order USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that didn't work out so well, because I didn't receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Patrick Miller.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what's your address, Mr. Miller?\n\nSpeaker 1: 10353 San Diego Mission Road, Apartment C, like Charlie, 319 San Diego, CA 92108.\n\nSpeaker 2: Looks like you've placed a few orders with us, Mr. Miller, and you have been with the company for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says here that it was delivered to your parcel locker on the 23rd. That would have been four days ago on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't see that on the fly? Check the locker and everything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I check it every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have the tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the USPS number was 940013.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have it here. No worries. I just wanted to make sure you have it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I placed a complaint with the postal service on this tracking number already.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's great. That gives me comfort.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was going to say, normally I'd have you reach out to the post office, but I don't see anything like this has ever happened with you before.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're saying you already lodged a complaint. We definitely appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Normally I would have you reach out to them and file a claim, or at the very least ask them,\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, are you guys able to locate this? What's going on? Maybe it was just delivered to the wrong place.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it sounds unlikely. If it's a parcel locker, it could have been stolen, it could have been by USPS,\n\nSpeaker 1: it could have been put into the wrong thing, in which case you'll never get it from a neighbor.\n\nSpeaker 2: It makes me mad because I get my mail every day, and it's never an issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this time, it was an issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it happens.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should use FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 2: We do use FedEx for expedited shipping, but we get a ton of issues with them also, honestly.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to have to reship this for you. I'm really sorry, Mr. Miller, you got 30 of the 5 mg options.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to reship this for you. We shouldn't see this happen again.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't cheap.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to take care of this for you today. I'll have it sent out and expedited for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you should see it by the end of the week. I'm going to send a priority mail, so it should be a little safer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we'll hopefully have that to you by Friday. It should be there Friday at the latest, and then you should see it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know if anything awry occurs, and we'll take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send a priority this time, so I think we'll be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Sorry about that. You take it easy. Bye-bye now.",
