    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Paul, this is K.T. Goodrich from Pfizer Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bear with me as I pull up your account with your telephone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: As I read off your chart when I pull that up, just help me verify some things.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can help you put a stop to that. All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud. Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when I read your chart, I see that you are working with Dr. Moore Holcomb, Pat?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you got the wrong guy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Before you go any further, you picked up the wrong line here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh. Pat?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Pat.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I meant, Pat.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're working with Dr. Moore Holcomb.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Moore Holcomb is our Pfizer doctor, and it looks like she set you up\n\nSpeaker 1: with the prescription and the VIP status for, just correct me if I'm wrong,\n\nSpeaker 2: the AGV Viagra, the white diet pill that we make in our Pfizer-Lazenfrancis,\n\nSpeaker 1: FDA-approved one.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I see that Dr. Moore Holcomb has ordered the pharmacy to send you refills\n\nSpeaker 1: on her behalf.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to put a stop to that so you're not getting those monthly anymore?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you to reverse the charge that happened today or yesterday\n\nSpeaker 2: and also cancel the rest of them, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that's hard for me to do, and I'll tell you why.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait, stop for just a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: I already sent you all an email right after I placed the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you get a reply for the email?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nobody replied, but I did send it, and I need you to reverse the charge for today,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't care why.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't even care why it's difficult to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't care?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why?\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't matter because it's only an excuse, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So all I need you to do is I already asked you all to –\n\nSpeaker 2: I simply asked you all not to auto-refill this order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I made it clear I was only doing a test to see how your product worked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it didn't, and it's not a really good product.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I definitely don't want it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I need you to reverse the charge, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I let you speak, Pat, and I'm just working with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the first time we ever met and we talked.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm only trying to explain to you I'm going to start the credit process now,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay, like you asked, and what I'm seeing is that the product went out.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's being shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a tracking number on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when it hits you, though, please refuse the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it gets back to us, and then I'll complete all the reverse of charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you there?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's breaking up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm still here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm still here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just trying to figure out what it is you're trying to bill me for.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't order anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're rehashing this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Am I being recorded, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm not recording you, but you're not listening to what I'm saying to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, with both my ears, sir, I listen to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you're breaking up with your connection or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to call back, sir, when you got a bad connection?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want to call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want you to take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so this is how I'm going to take care of it because this is our process.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just need you to be kind, and it takes strength to be kind.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's easy to be weak and fly off.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know your gears are grinded.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm upset, too, for you, but I didn't do this, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor ordered the pharmacy to send you a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't communicate with the doctor, and I'm just telling you what I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'm doing now is I'm putting a stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to put you on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to put a stop to all the monthly refills and all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to override the system.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a package being sent to you right now, so I'm trying to explain that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have a pen and paper on you,\n\nSpeaker 2: or do you want to go in the dashboard so you can locate the number\n\nSpeaker 1: so I can explain to you the return to sender?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to start the credit process now, but are you with me still?\n\nSpeaker 1: You have my email address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm not going to email you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I'm asking if you have a pen.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to email you because I don't have access to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm only on phone calls.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let me do the first things first.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me put you on a brief hold, and I'll put a stop to this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll do as you wish, and I'll start the credit process.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Pat?\n\nSpeaker 2: And let's start again on the right foot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not here to clash with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm here to support you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're Americans here, and, you know, Americans look out for each other.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't bully each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Look out for each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how we roll.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Stand by.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm ready for the address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, your address is 4062 Omron Drive, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so there's a package being sent to you for that charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: All you have to do is, when you get that package,\n\nSpeaker 1: write refuse return to sender and drop it in the USPS blue box.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we already have a tracking number on it that you sent back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm starting the credit process.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me put you on a brief hold so I can process this for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
