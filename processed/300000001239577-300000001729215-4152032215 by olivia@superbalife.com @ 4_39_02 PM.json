    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good afternoon, Olivia. My name is Rolando.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Rolando. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Rolando?\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to check my order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, you want to check your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your date of birth, Rolando?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 11-18-1955.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. And you're located at 23 Midvale Drive in Daly City, California?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Yeah, so I do see you here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you ordered 20 tablets. So you should get 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I was charged double.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you selected an add-on for 50% off. So the original price, the total price for 10 pills is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then a screen popped up that asked you if you wanted to add on 10 more pills for 50% off for $29.40, and you clicked on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why your order is for 20 pills total.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know when it's coming?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we'll probably ship it out tomorrow morning because the doctor did approve you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay. Is it coming tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't think it would get to you tomorrow, but they will probably ship it out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how many days will it work on people? I can get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, what?\n\nSpeaker 2: When it's going to be delivered, is it going to be this quick?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah. So it comes in this little white package, and it just says Go-Go Meds on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's a Kentucky address, so it doesn't even say score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a little bottle. It has the pills in it, and it's a little white package from Kentucky that says Go-Go Meds on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it from USPS?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, USPS. And once we ship it, which will probably be tomorrow morning, we will email you the tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the email we have on file for you is RolandoSilo18 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Thank you, Rolando. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you too.",
