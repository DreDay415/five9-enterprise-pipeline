    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, this is Jimmy, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I ordered some prescription through you in November, yeah, November 14th, I think it was, and I received it, received the bottle and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't very happy with it. It didn't do what I needed it to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, I thought it was a one-time bottle, a one-time subscription, prescription, and then the next month in December I got a bill saying it's a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called and I said, you know, I told them I didn't sign up for recurring prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought it was a one-time shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: And she apologized and she said, okay, we will make sure that we take you off.\n\nSpeaker 2: She said that just be assured that if you cancel your subscription, prescription right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can't reorder anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was fine with that. I said, okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I told her I wanted a refund also because I didn't, it was on my bank statement,\n\nSpeaker 2: $40 and some odd cents.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so she said, yeah, okay, we'll refund it and you're no longer, you know, subscribed to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that was fine. I've been watching my bank statements and I never saw a credit for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my new bank statement.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you off here now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can tell you, I don't see it being refunded, but I can go and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got my next bank statement today and it's still on there, so, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that what she did do, she did take you off of the auto shipment, but there's no refund there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and take care of that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: But look, Dave, this is what I want to do for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to do this for you, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Check it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because more importantly, you said that the product didn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what I want to do, let me go ahead and take care of your refund first of all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do that, as I mentioned, so that won't get moved aside.\n\nSpeaker 2: So bear with me one second as I get in there and take care of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just pull up your information there.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pull it up with your phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's going to go back to your visa in 5795, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I just went ahead and submitted that refund for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you should see a credit within two days for $40.29.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I would like to do for you as well, I would like to give you an opportunity\n\nSpeaker 1: to try the latest and greatest Viagra for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Since you've already placed that order and you said they didn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm not going to put you on any type of monthly recurrent shipment since,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know what I mean, obviously you didn't want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: At least you want to make sure the pills work for you before you want to place\n\nSpeaker 2: another order, no doubt.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I want to send you the new and improved AGB Viagra with 100 milligrams for\n\nSpeaker 2: free to try these because you didn't get the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got the regular Genet Viagra, and I think that's why you're having the issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I thought I did order it because that's why I ordered it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have Sildenafil now, and I take Sildenafil now, and I take 20 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so I have to take like three or four of them at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what you have is the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I can do that myself.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need to buy it from you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You didn't get the right one.\n\nSpeaker 1: The ones I'm going to send you for free is what you should have gotten in first\n\nSpeaker 2: order is a white-shaped diamond pill, very similar to what you're looking at,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to be the difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to say the same thing as your last prescription label has,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I want you to open up the package, the pills, and look at the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to see the number 100, and, Dave,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can guarantee you that these are going to have a better effect.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to work faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to last longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're not going to have those same side effects that a lot of people get\n\nSpeaker 1: with the regular generic Viagra, like the dizziness and the headaches\n\nSpeaker 2: and the stomach aches sometimes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So these are the ones that you should have got.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send these out ten for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to have you on a monthly refill so you get them every month\n\nSpeaker 2: automatically.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to give you like four or five months to try these, no charge,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I can guarantee you once you try these,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to be reordering these in the future,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm going to change your prescription to the ones I'm sending you out now\n\nSpeaker 1: for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you call in the order, don't go online now.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you go online, you're going to get confused.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did your order online when you did it at first, didn't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I did, but everything that it said online was exactly what you're telling me\n\nSpeaker 2: right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't get the right pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's your fault.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not my fault.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm sending you out the ten for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I know I'm going to get the right ones this time?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm telling you what they're going to have on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to have the number 100 on the back, and I'm not charging for these.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are no charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to give you like four months to try these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that means I'm going to have your prescription on file for the new\n\nSpeaker 1: and improved AGB Viagra, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It gives you four months to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want you to have my prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's the only way I can send these out, to have it on file.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't really want them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want the refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did that for you already, Dave.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was trying to give you the opportunity to try the ones that you should have got.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I wanted you to do, at least to try to make it right for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I wanted to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
