    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Danny Rayhold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Danny. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear it. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I need to refill my Glidafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I can help you with that. What is your date of birth, Danny?\n\nSpeaker 2: 12-5-51.\n\nSpeaker 1: Huh, that is not what we have. Okay, what's your address?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said 12-5-51.\n\nSpeaker 1: I picked up the prescription from my wife, and that's her birthday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mine is March 2, 1951.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Yeah, I can see you here. And you're located at 3802 Ario Drive, Weatherford, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Yeah, so we can definitely do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I looked it up on y'all's catalog bill, and I think I get 50 milligrams and get 90 pills. Can I do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: So as far as just like regular Sildenafil goes, 20 milligrams is the highest we do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if you wanted to order some Viagra, we could do higher doses.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I don't want Viagra. This works pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So you do 20 milligrams, and you usually order 54 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me see about that. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty. And you are still located at 3802 Ario Road, Weatherford, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the card we have on file – sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's drive, not road, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're right. I'm so sorry. You are correct. I apologize. Long week.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the card we have on file is the MasterCard that ends in 4496. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I had to get a new card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, you want to give me that updated information?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. It's 5463-2563-5493-7093.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. And what's the expiration date on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 1-30.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And what's the CVV on the back?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a 919.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. So I'm going to read this back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a MasterCard, and the number is 5463-2563-5493-7093.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the expiration is 0-1-30, and the CVV is 919.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Okay. So, yeah, I'm happy to place this refill for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just have to make sure that you understand once I place it that the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can place it on hold for you because I know it's a lot of pills if you don't want to receive them regularly.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you do have to have at least one refill saved in the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if six months rolls around, so if July 23rd rolls around and you still have pills\n\nSpeaker 1: or you don't need it, you'll just have to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need anything before then, you can have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need it before then. I really don't need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: These lasted, I don't know, I don't see when the last time I ordered it was,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's been more than six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so it's been nine months. You are correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you just need to let us know in July if you still have three months' worth of pills\n\nSpeaker 2: or five months' worth of pills or whatever you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just need to call us and say, hey, I still have three months' worth of pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you leave my script on hold?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because in order to place an order or have a prescription with us,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do have to have at least one of those refills saved six months out is the furthest that we can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Perfect. So I will place that right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much is a prescription like that? What does it cost now?\n\nSpeaker 2: $93.95 total.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man, that went up. It was $79.\n\nSpeaker 2: It did. Yeah, it was $79.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do is we can keep you at $79 as long as you keep the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: for at least like the next year or two.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I mean by that is you know how you're placing your prescription on hold until July 23rd\n\nSpeaker 2: just because that's the very latest we can do and you probably won't need pills\n\nSpeaker 1: for another eight or nine months?\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as you keep the prescription active, we can honor that $79 for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the prescription for the next one time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, for the foreseeable future ideally unless like you know some serious life thing\n\nSpeaker 1: or health thing came up or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, I'll make a note. So yeah, at least one refill ideally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I will go and refund you that amount. Let me see how much it's going to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's $93.95 minus $79. So that will be $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me go refund you $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Refund $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just submitted that. Let me renew your page.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you will see that refund maybe by the end of the day, maybe within the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll just make a note that I submitted pharmacy fee refund specifically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Specifically requested and agreed to keep Scripps active after previously canceling it\n\nSpeaker 1: if we would hold his VIP old price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so your order should be out to you probably by next Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you need anything before July 23rd, just let us know and you should see that refund soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great, Danny. Well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
