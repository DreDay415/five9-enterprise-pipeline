    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My first name is Jim.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Wasil. W-A-S-I-L.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Mr. Wasil, what's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 32940.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Are you at 1277 Cypress Trace Drive in Melbourne, Florida?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okie dokie. And then let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: What can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 1: I got my first prescription yesterday, but I'm not sure that it's the right thing,\n\nSpeaker 2: because on the bottle it just says, you know, it's generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take a quick look. The best way to know is, do you have the pills there with you,\n\nSpeaker 2: like the actual bottle?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. If you can take out one of the pills, you'll see it's smooth on one side,\n\nSpeaker 1: and on the other side there's an imprint.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me the imprint, because that will inform me of who the manufacturer is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's wrong. Okay, so that's the American AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to get you the French ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: The correct pill, or the French pill, the French AGV, will have a stamp of 100,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's how you know it's the correct one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't think this was the right pill, so what do I do about it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Oh, don't worry. We're going to replace it. We'll replace it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll have it expedited. At no cost to you, obviously, because you've already been here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not the greatest for my very first experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, very sorry about that. We'll go ahead and have that shipped out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with that one, you're welcome to try it. It's American-made.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you like it, then keep it. You get double the pills at this point.\n\nSpeaker 1: But otherwise, we're still sending you the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are not made in China or India. Those are made in the USA.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So this is not the – let me see. Let's see. Hang on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's supposed to be the – what kind of – it's some different Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the number or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the AGV. So the AGV is a new pill. It's made in France. It's FDA-approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just bear in mind, though, before I let you go, you know, at first blush,\n\nSpeaker 1: it might look similar. They're not. Okay? So the stamp on the AGV will have 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only other pill that has 100 is the branded blue Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: That indicates the manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Number two, the bottle will actually read AGV on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And number three, the pharmaceutical located on the side of the bottle\n\nSpeaker 2: where the label is will read Greenstone. Greenstone is a subsidiary of Pfizer. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Got it all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. Okay. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.",
