    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, sir. Are you there? Yes, sir. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I called to see if I could cancel my subscription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me pull up your account. Am I speaking to Jimmy Bethel?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I've got one other question. I thought I was buying the AGV. Is that what you have me down for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because every time I get a refill... You need to pull up your account first to look. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says generic is what I'm asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty. Yeah, it does look like you're supposed to be getting AGV here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it say AGV on the bottle that you received?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. It says generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, if it doesn't say actually AGV on the bottle, which that would also be a generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what it means, authorized generic Viagra from the company.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if it doesn't say that on the bottle, then that's not what you received. We can always replace that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you were saying you wanted to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and cancel it. $60 a month is a little much. It's hard to afford.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to get it monthly. You can get these as needed or whenever you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'd like to do. I'd like to get them as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can go ahead and replace some of those pills that you said if you're not getting the right thing. I don't mind doing that for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It just says generic Viagra. I don't know if that's AGV or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it doesn't say AGV on the bottle, then it's not what you received.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. I don't think it does.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Don't worry. I will make that adjustment for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I will set it up so basically for the next five months here, we'll keep your prescription open.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to have to call in to receive your next refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mike, I can give you my extension. That way I can place your order for you next and make sure your account stays like this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So the name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty. I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty. Well, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome, sir. You have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
