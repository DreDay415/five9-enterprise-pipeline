    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. This is David Harrison.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing, David?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm doing pretty good. I had canceled a subscription back in December,\n\nSpeaker 1: and all of a sudden I got a charge on my bank account for $163.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I did not request any more bills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. David Harrison, Lukedale, Mississippi.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Lukedale, Mississippi.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. How did you try to cancel it back in December?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you call?\n\nSpeaker 1: I called you, fellas.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh. Did you maybe call the pharmacy by mistake because we'll all bill?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no. I actually called you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yikes. Okay. I'm not calling you a liar or anything, David,\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, like I said, I did not get a chip in January so that it would just stop.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. So that's why I'm worried that you called the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: because all they're going to do is delay the next order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, look, here's what I can do. I can cancel everything going forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: This order is on its way. If you don't want it, it's going to arrive by Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: All you need to do is write return to sender on it with a marker or a pen,\n\nSpeaker 1: throw it back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mailman will take it and send it right back to us for a refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Just out of curiosity, David, how were you doing on the pills, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know. They didn't seem to be working that last set.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, usually you see blue lights or whatever, and they weren't working.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if they were a bad batch or just generic, whatever it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. If you're interested, I can see if my pharmacy can send over a version of the AGV\n\nSpeaker 1: that's made in our France factory for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you ten free pills if you're willing to try them\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if these ones are giving you the activation that you're looking for,\n\nSpeaker 2: the kick that you're looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if they do, call us back and let us know,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we can start accommodating with this pill that I send\n\nSpeaker 1: rather than the old one that you've been getting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, I like the old one. They weren't really doing it for me, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Yeah, maybe we just need to pivot a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll send the request into the pharmacy today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd expect the pills to arrive by maybe Thursday or Friday of next week,\n\nSpeaker 2: depending on weather and whatnot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there's no rush. I'm on the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to get home by, you know, once a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no rush on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The pills that you're going to be looking for that I send\n\nSpeaker 2: will have the number 100 pressed onto them like a stamp.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you're able to tell the difference, so just keep that in mind, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Bob. I appreciate your help, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. All right, David. I hope you have a great rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, Glenn. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.",
