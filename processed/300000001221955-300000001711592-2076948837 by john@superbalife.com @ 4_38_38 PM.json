I've gotten emails saying that it was all approved and all that, but I haven't got an updated email telling me when it was shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's your zip code, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: The zip code for what, the building or where it's being delivered?\n\nSpeaker 1: Either one.\n\nSpeaker 2: 04769.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Okay. 64 Broadway in Baileyville, Maine is where it's shipping to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me see what's going on here. Yeah, you've been approved. It should ship out tomorrow. I don't know why you haven't been updated about that, but I'm going to message the pharmacy just to make sure it goes out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once it does, I can follow up and send you a tracking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Thank you very much, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. I hope you have a great evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
