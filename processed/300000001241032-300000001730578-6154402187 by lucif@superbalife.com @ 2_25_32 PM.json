There's an option on there, but we can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going on with the Viagra? Why is it that you don't want it anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: Medical reasons, I can't use it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Well, let's see, you kind of just got this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did some things change? Because, you know, this was prescribed by a doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I went to my primary care physician, I'm having an issue with my heart.\n\nSpeaker 1: She said do not take Viagra or any other ED medication anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I know sometimes you guys do get cleared to pick back up with this type of stuff down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: When that is the case, we can always just put this on hold for you for like a half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: give you some time to figure things out.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just need to cancel it, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, we'll cancel you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pardon me, can you send me an e-mail verification that it's canceled, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we don't send any e-mail verifications, but I can confirm that everything was just canceled for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then how about directing me on the website to where the cancellation request would be?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can sign into your website, and you can see under your prescriptions that everything says you are,\n\nSpeaker 2: that there is no more prescription there.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says you are not currently on auto-ship, and everything hasn't stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when I go into my prescriptions, there's no way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm in my prescriptions right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't give an option to stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's because everything has stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you go to the last option on the bottom right, you will see that it says you are not currently on anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's because everything has been stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, down at the bottom under auto-ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says you are not currently on auto-ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything else that you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all I needed, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you have a good day.",
