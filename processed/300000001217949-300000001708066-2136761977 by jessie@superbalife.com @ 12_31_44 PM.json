    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tariq Ayari.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you spell your last name for me, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: A-y-a-r-i.\n\nSpeaker 1: A-y-a-r-i, Ayari?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, Mr. Ayari, what can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I tried to order it online, but I received a message regarding my past order. I don't know if my new order will go through, and I don't know how much it costs. And I just want to order the new Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what? It's probably not available on your – because it's a first-come, first-served. But let me help you with that. Mr. Ayari, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 89052.\n\nSpeaker 1: 890 – I have an old zip code here, 91791.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you no longer at that address?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: I changed it online.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put my new address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: You only put it for the billing, not the shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me check this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is 11450 Bermuda Road, number 2072.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's in Henderson, Nevada, 89052.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and update this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, your stuff is going to go back to West Covina.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm awful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's years ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see here, because it wasn't changed with the shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: I changed it to the Bermuda Street address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the AGV comes in three dosages, which is 25, 50, and 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which one did you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: And they're all the same price, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to get the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then your best deal is 40 pills for 149.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you like to do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: 40?\n\nSpeaker 1: Four zero.\n\nSpeaker 2: Four zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: Four zero pills for 149.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how much?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it 20?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, we don't have 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have 25 pills for 99.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I will do the 25, yeah, for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whenever you're ready, can I get the credit card number, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: By the way, you know, I want to do –\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you update it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I did update it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have it in the system?\n\nSpeaker 1: We have a Discover ending in 1860.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that the right one?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I updated a new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I don't see it here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you – whenever you're ready, can I get the credit card number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or did you have any other questions for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to give you – I guess I don't want to be like being\n\nSpeaker 1: charging every month, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you have, because with this one you do need to have an active\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription for the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this is at will.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that means is you can order whenever you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order on demand.\n\nSpeaker 1: You won't get anything in the mail, any kind of random stuff, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: However, to keep your prescription active and to make sure you have\n\nSpeaker 1: access to your refills, if you do not place an order in six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: it will send you one refill, and that's it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we have to in order to keep it active.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, whenever you're ready, I'll get the credit card number.\n\nSpeaker 2: 6011.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4102.\n\nSpeaker 1: 5371.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1860.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1860.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and the expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0930.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0930.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 117.\n\nSpeaker 1: 117.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's 100 mg AGVs, and that's 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many mg?\n\nSpeaker 2: 100, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you are all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should get this in the mail in less than a week,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it will go to your Henderson address, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any way I can just expedite the shipping?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, is there any way what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: To send it faster, like Express or something like that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's an additional charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: So FedEx, well, you can't do FedEx overnight now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's already too late.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you want it to ship out tomorrow with FedEx overnight to arrive the\n\nSpeaker 1: following day, it's $38.\n\nSpeaker 2: FedEx today would leave tomorrow and arrive on Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's $28.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you can do USPS priority.\n\nSpeaker 1: It arrives in two to three business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's $15.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will do FedEx, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: FedEx overnight or FedEx today?\n\nSpeaker 1: For Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 2: For Thursday, yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that's an additional $28, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So FedEx is going to put it in my door, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, FedEx just leaves it in front of your door.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, we'll keep an eye out for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you please confirm my unit number?\n\nSpeaker 1: 2072.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I add building number, please, and my address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what is the correct address?\n\nSpeaker 1: Eleven.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I just moved here.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: It sounds complicated.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want FedEx to put it in my neighborhood.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to make sure it's the correct address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, my correct address is 11425 Bermuda Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: 11425, not 11450?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: 11425.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Unit 2072.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what is the zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 89052.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me notify the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's a good thing you looked at your own address,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that would have gone to the completely wrong place.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I was doing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I notified the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: 11425 Bermuda Road, unit 2072, 89052.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my last question, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that the new Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okie dokie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.",
