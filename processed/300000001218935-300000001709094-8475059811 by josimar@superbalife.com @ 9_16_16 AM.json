V-O-I-N-O-V-I-C-H.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the zip is 65624.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I pulled you up here. So one option\n\nSpeaker 2: I can actually give you because I do see you're one of our VIP members. Instead of cancelling it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could just go ahead and put you on the six-month freeze.\n\nSpeaker 2: It gives you the option to call us to get it sooner or to push it another six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you don't lose out on your discounted rate as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um...\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd just assume go ahead and cancel it for now and if I meet, you know, down the line—\n\nSpeaker 2: The main reason I bring that up too is because the thing is the prescription is attached to the refill date.\n\nSpeaker 1: The moment we cancel out the date, what it does is it actually deletes the visit from the doctor's end.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that you wouldn't be able to order this in the future because the doctor won't create another visit since we kind of—\n\nSpeaker 1: Pay for that first visit.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you do freeze it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: You're gonna always just reach back out to us to order it whenever you would want it or you could just delay it\n\nSpeaker 2: For another half year. We have no problem with that whatsoever. At least our prescription remains active in the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, I'll go ahead and make that adjustment to your account right now and you're all set on that part.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give us a call back if you have any other questions or you need it sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: But other than that, I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.
