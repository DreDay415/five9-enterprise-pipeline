    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: David Slater.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi David, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today, David?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you charged me $113.95,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I did not authorize that.\n\nSpeaker 2: In fact, I canceled it last time I talked to somebody.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want my money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there, have you had more than one\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription with us before?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because what I see is the last one was February 2025\n\nSpeaker 2: under this phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a newer phone number you might have used?\n\nSpeaker 2: On the newer? No.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have the right phone number on my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You have the right\n\nSpeaker 1: phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it's the last order you made with us\n\nSpeaker 1: on February. 113.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, January 24th.\n\nSpeaker 1: January 24th, 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well then there must be a different phone number\n\nSpeaker 1: under that account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's go try to find it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you in El Paso, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the number we have for that is 210-937-4000.\n\nSpeaker 2: Never heard of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, we wouldn't have made that up.\n\nSpeaker 1: You would have put that in your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, can you just confirm your address for me, David?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 12 Charles Heinrich, El Paso, Texas, 79927.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so that, it looks like,\n\nSpeaker 2: I am sorry if that was confusing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't see that was your first refill,\n\nSpeaker 2: but then you have had a prescription with us in the past,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you did know that our prescriptions\n\nSpeaker 2: come with regular refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: unless you let us know that that's not how you\n\nSpeaker 2: had them set up?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got done telling you I canceled it\n\nSpeaker 2: last time I talked to them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right after that statement, or that prescription came.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just counted it, and I said they canceled the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I just don't have any record of you\n\nSpeaker 2: having spoken to anybody,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I am sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, so here's what we can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: The minute you receive the pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: which will probably be like Wednesday or Thursday,\n\nSpeaker 1: as long as you do not open the package,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can just write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they will bring it, your post person\n\nSpeaker 2: will bring it right back to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll be able to use the exact same tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is impossible.\n\nSpeaker 1: I started contacting you three days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have all the support tickets,\n\nSpeaker 1: all the support tickets are in my email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give us 24 hours, we'll get back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, 48 hours went by and no contact.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told you I did, you're taking money off my table for food.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I have to wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so let me,\n\nSpeaker 2: here's what I'm gonna do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna message the pharmacy right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm gonna see, the thing is,\n\nSpeaker 1: if the order would have been for yesterday,\n\nSpeaker 2: they probably wouldn't have sent it yet,\n\nSpeaker 1: but because it was two days ago,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's very likely they have.\n\nSpeaker 1: If there's any way, can you possibly cancel this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you sent it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you sent it?\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're gonna respond to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: The trouble is, especially on Mondays,\n\nSpeaker 2: I will hear back from them,\n\nSpeaker 1: I will hear back from them,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it'll be anywhere between 30 minutes\n\nSpeaker 1: and the next two hours,\n\nSpeaker 2: and once they let me know,\n\nSpeaker 1: if they say, yeah, we can cancel this,\n\nSpeaker 2: which would be amazing,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just cancel and refund the order immediately,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you'll get the refund today, tomorrow,\n\nSpeaker 1: the next day.\n\nSpeaker 2: It can technically take three to five business days,\n\nSpeaker 1: but for most people it's faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if they have already sent it,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I think is the likely unfortunate reality,\n\nSpeaker 2: then yes, the policy is you do have to return it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you would just write return to sender\n\nSpeaker 2: on the package upon receiving it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and as long as you do not open it,\n\nSpeaker 2: your post person or USPS, however you wanna do it,\n\nSpeaker 1: will bring it straight back to us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we can refund you the minute we receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you...\n\nSpeaker 2: People are impossible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Impossible.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am offering you options,\n\nSpeaker 1: so things are possible, in fact, David,\n\nSpeaker 2: for instance, shipping could get back to me\n\nSpeaker 1: within the next hour and say,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, we haven't sent this,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I could cancel the order,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would be amazing,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that would be possible.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, if, like I mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 1: if they have sent it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you also have a third option\n\nSpeaker 1: where you could do return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 2: let's say you do that on Wednesday or Thursday or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the next day,\n\nSpeaker 2: you call us, the next day or two days, even better,\n\nSpeaker 1: call us, say, hey, I did return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: We could pull up the same tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: and see that you did that\n\nSpeaker 2: and that it is being on its way returned to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we can also process the refund\n\nSpeaker 2: then even earlier if needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, those are the extensive options.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want the more extensive directions,\n\nSpeaker 1: like if you want to go to USPS directly,\n\nSpeaker 2: but see, the thing is we don't even know\n\nSpeaker 1: if you have to do that yet,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I can email you the more extensive directions\n\nSpeaker 1: if you do want to go do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's up to you versus if it's from your house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't redo a return to sender\n\nSpeaker 1: because there is no box,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm disabled,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it's hard for me to get to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're causing me all this work\n\nSpeaker 1: when you could have just canceled it on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, we were here on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, if you would have called us,\n\nSpeaker 2: we definitely would.\n\nSpeaker 1: We had very few calls on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: We definitely would have picked up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did a support ticket.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: This company is out of control.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want my account canceled ASAP.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want any more of your stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you certainly do not have to go to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 1: that was the very last option,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that was if you wanted to do that,\n\nSpeaker 1: I offered you that as an option.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, if you do receive it,\n\nSpeaker 1: as long as you don't open it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can just write return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I'm able to cancel it,\n\nSpeaker 2: if they didn't send it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you an email today\n\nSpeaker 2: in the next few hours\n\nSpeaker 1: at your email,\n\nSpeaker 2: davidks5683\n\nSpeaker 1: at yahoo.com,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, there's unfortunately,\n\nSpeaker 2: statistically a 30 to 40% likelihood,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that's something.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who knows?\n\nSpeaker 2: They're just three hours ahead of us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that means they have been shipping\n\nSpeaker 2: the past five hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, David.\n\nSpeaker 1: So hopefully you'll hear from me,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not,\n\nSpeaker 2: just write return to sender on the package,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll make sure you get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure you cancel my account, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: I already did that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The refund will still go through, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, if-\n\nSpeaker 2: Will you close my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: So as we've discussed extensively on this call,\n\nSpeaker 2: the refund will only go through\n\nSpeaker 1: if the package is returned,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if shipping tells me they have not sent it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and therefore I am able to cancel and refund the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if my account is canceled?\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, what is your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm gonna write that down next time\n\nSpeaker 2: I have to call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, been no help, but thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
