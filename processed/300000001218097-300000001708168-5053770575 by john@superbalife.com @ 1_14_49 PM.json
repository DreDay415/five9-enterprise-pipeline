    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, John. I went online and I think I filled out the proper work for a prescription, but I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can check. I just need your name and zip code. I can double check everything for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. John Buffington. Zip code is 87401.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4409 Cayamillo?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I see here is that you ordered the 50 milligrams. You ordered 80 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You first ordered 40 and then it asked if you wanted 40 more and you hit yes, you'll get 80 total.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I do see the order went through successfully.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And that's when you say 15. I thought it was in 50 or...\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no. Sir, I said 50, 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I misunderstood that thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. So then I'm done. I just need to what? Wait?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just need to wait, yeah. So what's going to happen is that health information you filled out,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's going to be transmitted to a doctor we work with. That doctor will be licensed to practice in your state.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll review everything and then by tomorrow they will have approved you and then we'll ship it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're just waiting. You'll get an email as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sounds good. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
