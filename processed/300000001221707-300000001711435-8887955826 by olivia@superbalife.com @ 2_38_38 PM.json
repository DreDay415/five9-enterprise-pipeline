    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Dale Hill, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Dale. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm so glad to hear it. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys have sent me the meds, the Viagra, but I really just wanted to try it. I didn't want them to keep sending it to me every month, so I was calling early to cancel the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay, so what is the phone number that would be associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 170-433-8491.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. There you are, Dale. And what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 1769.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Give me one moment, because that's not what we have, but I'll update it. And are you located at 1709 Levita Street, Grand Junction, Colorado?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular ongoing monthly refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option with your prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is if you did want to order at any point within the next six months, you could. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. So yeah, your prescription is on hold, but if you need anything before the end of July, just give us a call here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific. We're always here at this number. And I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty. Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye now.",
