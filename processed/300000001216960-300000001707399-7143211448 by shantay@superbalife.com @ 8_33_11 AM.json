    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi there. I want to say first of all, thank you very much for getting back with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had sent an email, you know, to your request and anyway, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm calling about is canceling out the order that I placed on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's your name and your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. My name is Wayne Soule.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's S-O-W-E-L-L.\n\nSpeaker 1: Date of birth would be 5-3-1949.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And while I'm pulling up your account, Wayne, may I ask the reason\n\nSpeaker 2: for wanting to cancel the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, actually, the reason being is because, you see, okay, it's kind of a long story,\n\nSpeaker 2: but what it is is that my doctor, you know, my personal physician, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I have taken Viagra, you know, for several years, you know, through his prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I mean, I have absolutely no problem, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: with getting prescriptions and all that sort of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, what I've done in order to, let's say, not to burden him with so many prescriptions,\n\nSpeaker 1: so on and so forth, I have also taken Viagra through Zip Health, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been taking them for the past, oh, about a year and a half or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, they gave me the little blue pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: The prescription I get from my doctor is a very, very good prescription, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the blue pill one is okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not as good as, you know, my doctor's prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway, what I do is I order my doctor's, you know, I get that, and just in order to,\n\nSpeaker 2: as I say, not burden him with so many prescriptions, I order through another facility too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, because the little blue pill is not as potent as my doctor's,\n\nSpeaker 2: I figured I'd try another one, which was you guys, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, when I looked on your website and, you know, was going to order,\n\nSpeaker 2: I made sure that I would not be getting, you know, constant refills, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: like so many other companies, you know, do to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because, I mean, I don't need constant refills because I have so much product as it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need a monthly supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: All I need to do is just supplement my supply because, you see, what my doctor told me to do is\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut them in half, which is what I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, let's say I get 60 from my doctor, that goes 120.\n\nSpeaker 1: I get another, let's say, 40 from you, I cut it in half, that goes to another 80.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's like 200 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, why would I ever need a constant refill, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to buy as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You follow what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And so, anyway, after I ordered it, you know, I'm looking through your website\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm going, oh, no, this is a subscription, you know, order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need this type of thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So.\n\nSpeaker 2: The good thing is, though, the good thing is that you're able to, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I see that the doctor already approved your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, your order's actually being prepared to ship today by our pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if you're not with us, you're not obligated to keep the refills if you don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's two things you can do once you receive the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can either, or I can do it now for you, if it's something that you might need\n\nSpeaker 2: to, like, supplement your prescription for Viagra down the line,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can change it to every six months so you're only charged two times a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or, after you get your pills, you can call us back and just simply cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I would rather just simply cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: You see, okay, I would simply rather cancel right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, I mean, if I need another supply, what, you see, what I've always done,\n\nSpeaker 2: like, with Zip, okay, is as the need, like, right now, today, you know, I'm sitting on,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, my doctor's prescription, I've got 25 pills on hand.\n\nSpeaker 2: With Zip, I'm down to my last five, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, that's the reason why I was kind of shopping around is because, okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm down to my last five as far as my reserve is concerned.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I, that's why I called you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: You see, I only need to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't, I don't, I don't want a prescription, you know, I mean, not a prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: but a subscription type, pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, the two options that we, we do have is to make it a little bit more flexible for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's either, one, we can change it and adjust it to every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: The prescription only requires you, for you to keep it,\n\nSpeaker 2: it only requires you to get two shipments a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or, two, once you get your first order, you can give us a call back\n\nSpeaker 2: and discontinue if you want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but I have to wait until I get my first order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because if I cancel it now, it's going to cancel the entire order\n\nSpeaker 1: and the pharmacy is not going to send it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I already sent out your, I already.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then cancel it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you don't want it at all?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want it at all, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm going to cancel it and give you back the refund of $163.95 and I'll go back\n\nSpeaker 1: onto your card within three to five days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 1: That, that's, that's, that's wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's nice doing business with, can you send me a receipt of your cancellation on my email?\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 1: And who am I speaking with again?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Shantae.\n\nSpeaker 1: Shantae, pleased to meet you, Shantae, and thank you very much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, it's my pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you too, bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, bye-bye.",
