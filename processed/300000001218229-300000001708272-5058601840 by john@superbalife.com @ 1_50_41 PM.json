    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Roland Barney and I just placed an order and I received a text message that I needed to talk to the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I think I know what's going on. I can help you, sir. What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 87401.\n\nSpeaker 1: 219 County Road 3950?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so there's a handful of states and New Mexico must be a new one this year that requires an extra step.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's one of two things, a video or the doctor calls your phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: The phone call is usually easier for most customers. You prefer I just have a doctor call you. He would confirm a few details and then approve you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, he can call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I have 505-860-1840.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I will tell the doctor that we can't do the video and just to call you. Like I said, it should be maybe a 30 second to a minute call. If that, he'll confirm a few details.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, if the video would be easier, that's fine too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't, I mean, and this is not meant in any slight. I don't know your technical proficiency. If you're good at like taking it with your phone and sending it over to us, a lot of our customers struggle with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, if you think you can do that, we can, we're happy to do that. It will be a little bit faster. Otherwise, I can do the phone call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the video is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, do you have an email, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you text the video?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, let's just do the phone call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. I will get that set up for you. So, they'll call you. It's typically within about a 24 hour span, if not sooner, but I just don't know exactly what time he'll call, but I will get this taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, sir. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
