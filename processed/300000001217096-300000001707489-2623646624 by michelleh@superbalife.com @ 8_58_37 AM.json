    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, can you hear me? Yeah. How can I help you? Yeah, I was online and it had, it was 10 or\n\nSpeaker 1: 20, Viagra, what is that, AGV? Yeah. And I want to know, okay, I took the payment of $63, $64,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I want to know, so I want to make sure it was the one that I'm getting there because\n\nSpeaker 1: I got an email saying something about Sidiphil, and Sidiphil, ain't that, that's Cialis, ain't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, Tadaphil is Cialis. Sidenafil is Viagra, the main ingredient in Viagra. It's the inactive\n\nSpeaker 1: ingredients in the AGV that make it work more effectively. Angelo, can you just confirm your\n\nSpeaker 2: date of birth? 1-30-68. Thank you so much. Is he your VIP status customer? Okay, it looks like\n\nSpeaker 1: the doctor approved your prescription. It's at the pharmacy. They're going to ship it out to you\n\nSpeaker 2: today. So yeah, a quantity of 10 is $49, but then the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee, so\n\nSpeaker 1: it comes out to $63.95. Okay, so it ain't the old Viagra, it's the new one. It's the new one, yes,\n\nSpeaker 2: yes, the new one that works faster. And what's, what, what, what's different? What makes that\n\nSpeaker 1: work faster then? Okay, so it's the inactive ingredients. The best way I can explain it is,\n\nSpeaker 2: say if you had two cups of water and you put a generic in a cup of water and you put an AGV in\n\nSpeaker 1: a cup of water. The generic is going to dissolve in 30 seconds. The AGV is going to dissolve in\n\nSpeaker 2: about two to three minutes. That means when you swallow it, it allows the medication more time\n\nSpeaker 1: to get down to your member to work more efficiently. And people say they feel a kick\n\nSpeaker 2: in, in about 11 to 15 minutes, but on the bottle, it will say take one hour prior just to get the\n\nSpeaker 1: full results. And then it lasts for 14 hours and less side effects, especially less headaches and\n\nSpeaker 2: less of that flush feeling. Yeah, because I used to get headaches real bad for like three or four\n\nSpeaker 1: days. Oh geez, that's horrible. Yeah, so the AGV, people who get headaches from just the generic,\n\nSpeaker 2: they say the AGV does not give them headaches. Yeah, and then, and, and, and, and the other one\n\nSpeaker 1: used to mess with my vision. Oh, yeah. Something to do with the blood pressure behind the eyes or\n\nSpeaker 2: something like that. Yeah, but I see they're going to ship it out to you today. The pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: will email you a tracking number. It's just sort of Kentucky, so you'll receive it in about five\n\nSpeaker 2: days or less. Okay, so is that going to be a shipment every month or do I, I got to go online\n\nSpeaker 1: and do it every month? Um, so it does, it does automatically, Aquantipen puts you on automatic\n\nSpeaker 2: refills on a monthly basis, but now that you have VIP status, you don't have to be on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you could pause it two to three months. A lot of people just like to pause it for six\n\nSpeaker 2: months. That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you need\n\nSpeaker 1: a refill. I could pause that for you if you need to. What do you mean by deposit? No, no, pause,\n\nSpeaker 2: like pause, pause your refills. So that way you're in control, like whenever it keeps your, so that\n\nSpeaker 1: way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh, okay. You want to do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just leave it like it is. I'll just call in every time. I can call y'all directly\n\nSpeaker 2: and put the description in or I got to go online again? Um, you could do it either way,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if you want to, if you want to call in as needed, it's better just to call us because\n\nSpeaker 2: on your profile you don't have the option to pause it. You have to call in to pause it\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can give you my extension if you don't want to, if that helps. Yeah, I got it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll pause you until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: The fun part is trying to find something to write with.\n\nSpeaker 1: My house is under construction and it's hard to find stuff. Yeah, let's be honest,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's hard to find stuff all the time. Yeah, okay, what's your extension? Okay, it's 0020\n\nSpeaker 1: and my name is Michelle. You said 0020? Yes, Michelle. Michelle, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'll just call and push your extension in and then... Yeah, and then you'll go to the\n\nSpeaker 1: top of my call list. You don't have to sit on hold. Yeah, okay, I got other questions to ask\n\nSpeaker 2: if you have time. Sure. Okay, like I don't take prescription drugs that my doctor gave me that I\n\nSpeaker 1: had transformed over to herbs. Oh, that's awesome. And I feel a lot better and energized and all that\n\nSpeaker 2: I think. So I was off of it for about three months, four months because of the construction\n\nSpeaker 1: going on in my house and stuff. So I stopped taking it, but now I'm getting back. I just\n\nSpeaker 2: started back two days ago. That won't mess with the virus, won't mess with the herbs that I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: taking, will it? No, it will not. And also, you also have access to talk to your clinician that's\n\nSpeaker 2: assigned to you. So if you have any questions, you can log in and directly message the doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: if you have any questions and he will answer you. Okay. Yeah. Because I don't... Taking the\n\nSpeaker 2: herbs and the asgandas and sagisalutes and all that stuff, I've been taking it, but I don't know\n\nSpeaker 1: if it really gives me... Just as long as they don't lower your blood pressure, because I know\n\nSpeaker 2: that's what the Viagra does, is just as long as they don't lower your blood pressure, you're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And I hear some people say the best results when you're taking a Cialis or a Viagra is they\n\nSpeaker 2: say drink warm water. Is that true or is that a myth? I don't know. Maybe that's a myth, maybe\n\nSpeaker 1: because it helps it dissolve. But I know you do want to take it on an empty stomach or you just\n\nSpeaker 2: want to make sure you don't eat a fatty meal like a burger or a steak, because that will affect\n\nSpeaker 1: the medication breaking down in your body. What about drinking? You're not supposed to drink\n\nSpeaker 2: alcohol because it thins your blood. Okay. So not even just one beer? I mean, I think one beer's\n\nSpeaker 1: fine. I mean, what the hell? Yeah. But I mean, I was like, the hell, I got to either pop a pill or\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't drink, this is fucked up. You know, me and my old lady be at the bar and all that. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: exactly. I know. And I only drink like one beer. Oh, yeah, one beer's fine. One beer's fine. Not,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, not like four cocktails. Right. Yeah. Yeah, one beer's really fine. Okay, so I think\n\nSpeaker 1: that's, oh, so these here only last in your system for 14 hours. 14 hours, yeah. And so you got 50s,\n\nSpeaker 2: so try one. And if, you know, if one doesn't do the trick, you can take two. You can take up to\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligrams within 24 hours. Yeah, that's what I was shooting for was the 100. Okay. Well, just\n\nSpeaker 2: call me and next time we can up them to 100. I would, but I can't switch out because they're\n\nSpeaker 1: shipping now, but next time we can do 100 to the same price. Right. So is it, is it,\n\nSpeaker 2: what, what do the milligrams got to do with it? What, what is that spot on the other one?\n\nSpeaker 1: So usually people who, who first time trying it out, the doctor usually just, you know, gives you\n\nSpeaker 2: 50 milligrams, but they come in 25, 50 and 100 milligrams. I think the 25s don't do anything\n\nSpeaker 1: to waste time and money. So, yeah, so try the 50s and then next time we can get you the 100s\n\nSpeaker 2: because it's the same price and you can always break them in half. Okay. All right. So is more\n\nSpeaker 1: important, potent? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I'll try that. I'll do the 50. All right. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, start with the 50s and then, you know, if you don't, if you're not getting the results,\n\nSpeaker 1: then try taking two and then just give us a call. We can switch your prescription to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Cause it's, uh, it's the, uh, uh, last off the, uh, uh, commercial. Okay. It says\n\nSpeaker 1: we can, we made a new Viagra and it gets you, it makes you bigger, like last. Yeah. It allows a\n\nSpeaker 2: lot more blood flow. I know people call it or say you get bigger. I'm like, no, we're born with what\n\nSpeaker 1: we got, but more blood flow makes it appear bigger. Do we make you last longer or? I think so. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Yeah. That'd be it. Cause I've been asking a bunch of questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No worries. Well, you have my extension, so you can always call me back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thank you. No problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye.",
