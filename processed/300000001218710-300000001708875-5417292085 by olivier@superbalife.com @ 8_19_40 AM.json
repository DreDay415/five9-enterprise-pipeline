    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Mr. Vic Williams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm pulling your prescription. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cincinnati, Ohio?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Vic Williams in Ohio, Cincinnati?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cincinnati. How may I help you, Mr. Williams?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to close my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any health concern, or you just don't need it for a while?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just don't need it. To be honest with you, I haven't tried one out of the first prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I've already sent one prescription back, so I'm jumping ahead on this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to close the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You know you have the option to pause, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And the order has needed maybe 10 pills once or twice a year, but not 40 pills or those big quantities.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I know I had that option. I talked to somebody about it before.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just want to close the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. I just want to make sure you're not going to need 10 pills of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why? Because you have a doctor's consultation. They finance, but when you lose that, you try to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: They've got to get a new one, and they change the price because of the cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the cost becomes double on that doctor's consultation that they cover for you initially.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why usually they offer to pause it to half a year, and then you get 10 pills once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not necessarily 40. You're not required to get 40 pills. You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know. I'd rather just close the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it a health concern, or you feel like you don't want to use it no more?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't sell everything, but I'm just curious because I can place notes here for research.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just don't use it. Like I said, I haven't used one pill out of the very first prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Me and my woman split up, and I like it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. You like it that way?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sometimes it's better. More peace.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: More peace.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: For better health.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got that right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Williams. I canceled everything. It's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did cancel everything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, everything is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor, consultation, the account. So you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good one. Have a good week.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.",
