How can I help you today, Alan?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my prescription. It's not working for me anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you out with that. Okay, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-23-49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that is not what we have, but I'm going to update it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you said 2-23-49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, how about this then?\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your address?\n\nSpeaker 1: 701 North Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard, Unit 10-06.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and the pills, they just don't work for you anymore?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, it is my job to let you know that I can see you've been with us for some time.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, A, you may or may not already know this,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if you don't want to receive regular ongoing monthly refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: We always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then in addition to that, it is my job to let you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do qualify for a free sample of their newest, highest quality product.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is their fastest-acting, longest-lasting Viagra we've ever made,\n\nSpeaker 2: but my favorite thing about it is we've specifically formulated it\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it is a superior prescription to your current one.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does come with kind of like a five-month free trial,\n\nSpeaker 2: where the way it works is, obviously, if this script doesn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's canceled out and it would be replaced by this one,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it started with the free sample of 10 pills and placed on hold for you until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: While you try it out, make sure you love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Make sure you prefer it to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Use the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would and that you'd give us a call in the next two to five months\n\nSpeaker 1: to order some, and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 2: based off of the data and the reviews themselves.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'd have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: They are a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send them to you at 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because that's what you've already been approved for,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they are more potent than your previous prescription anyway, but because it's 50,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you do want to take two at a time, it is technically safe to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship this free sample to 701 North Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard,\n\nSpeaker 2: 1006 Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, those should get to you by Thursday or Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need anything before then, we're always here.\n\nSpeaker 1: This phone number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a reminder, you want to make sure to take the pills on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then also very important, you want to avoid caffeine and alcohol the day you take them,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you for that information.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need anything for June, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day, Alan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
