I see that you have a special pricing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, once I cancel it, it will cancel your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: and all future refills as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sir, you are canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
