Uh, you want my RX number or what do you need to...\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, your, your, your name and zip code are the most helpful for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's Al Malone and, uh, 95, uh, what else did you want?\n\nSpeaker 1: 33321?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: 33321?\n\nSpeaker 2: 33321, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Waterford Avenue?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: What can I help with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: First of all, they're not blue, like advertisement, and it doesn't say that on the pill, and it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so a few things. I can help you out here, sir, but a few things.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're called Score Blue. The AGV pill is not blue. It's a white pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: We advertise it as white. It's shown as white on the website.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, but regarding it not working and that other stuff, do you have any pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure you still have some pills, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I have 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you were saying 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have 20 total.\n\nSpeaker 1: You haven't taken all 20?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I only took the one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's what I was asking. So can you, can you take out a pill and tell me what you see stamped on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, because I think there's a... Hang on one second, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it says...\n\nSpeaker 2: AC240.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 340.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the problem, sir. We screwed up. Um, you didn't get sent the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were sent just regular, basic, generic Viagra, which is probably why it didn't work out well for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to, it's not going to cost you anything because you've already paid.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to get your order fixed, though, sir. So I'm going to get you the right pill sent out and, um, they will say 100 on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you said AC340, that's how I knew for sure it was the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what I figured there was an error.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I'm sorry about that, but you will get 20 of the right one, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome. Have a good one, Al.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
