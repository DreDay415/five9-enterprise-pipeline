I was told that I have to call back in and speak to somebody to cancel my prescription, my order, everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I was filling out online service tickets, and I thought I could take care of it there, but they said I had to call in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, the reason why, because you placed the order on the 24th, so what you're going to have to do, you're just going to have to return it when you get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because usually you're able to cancel the day of, but when it's like two, four days later, I mean on the 24th, two days later, what you can do, you can just return it and we're going to refund you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll make sure everything's canceled, stopped, no more filling, no more billing, no more nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay. And then just write refuse return to the center when you get them, okay? If you don't want them, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yep. Okay, and you made sure everything—\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to get your refund. Yes, I'm canceling everything here. If anything changes, just be aware of price change, because you were approved by the doctor, so I'm tossing that consultation moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you got to receive that order first, right? Because the consultation got to exist for you to receive that legally.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then after that, when you receive it, call us back, let us know that you return it, so we get the refund and we cancel everything, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: But nothing will come your way in between. Just receive it, return it, and that's it, okay? Let us know, call us back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want nothing else shipped or billed or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, nothing's going to be shipped and billed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So I got to call you back after I get it and put return to center on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you return, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
