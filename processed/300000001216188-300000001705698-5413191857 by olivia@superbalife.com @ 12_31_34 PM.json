    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Frank Panyon. I ordered from you guys\n\nSpeaker 2: and got that order, and then you sent me another order\n\nSpeaker 1: and I called and canceled. And the\n\nSpeaker 2: guy there told me I could return the ones that are coming now\n\nSpeaker 1: and I did a month ago and I still haven't got my refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can definitely look into this\n\nSpeaker 1: for you. Okay, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: January 19th, 1960.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, and you're located at 721 Bothwick Street, Myrtle Point, Oregon?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Let's go into the\n\nSpeaker 1: back-end system to see about you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, did you send it back\n\nSpeaker 1: via return to sender, or did you go to the post\n\nSpeaker 2: office and get a tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 1: I went to the post office and rejected it. They gave me a tracking number, and it looks\n\nSpeaker 2: like it's going all over the United States.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so we haven't received it yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I just got back from the post office and they told me to contact you because\n\nSpeaker 1: you would see that I rejected it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what is the tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9400\n\nSpeaker 1: 1362\n\nSpeaker 2: 0769\n\nSpeaker 1: 9274\n\nSpeaker 2: 997275\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent them back\n\nSpeaker 2: over a month ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so unfortunately, when I pull up the tracking number,\n\nSpeaker 2: it doesn't show return to sender, which it\n\nSpeaker 1: always does when the package is returned to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, it does show that it's in transit\n\nSpeaker 1: since today. Today it got to\n\nSpeaker 2: Indianapolis, Indiana, it says.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been there several times. Look at all the tracking of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going all over the United States, back and forth.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so when\n\nSpeaker 2: the product is written return to sender on it, and\n\nSpeaker 1: we pull up the tracking number, always\n\nSpeaker 2: the policy USPS has is that\n\nSpeaker 1: the image that shows on the screen is return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if we haven't received it yet, it shows return to sender\n\nSpeaker 1: because that is what the person did.\n\nSpeaker 2: They refused it and they returned it to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what the post office said. They rejected it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that should be the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because their policy is\n\nSpeaker 1: that we're super happy to refund you, it's just\n\nSpeaker 2: we do that once we receive the product back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see. You're laughing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's every company that you do business with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I would have to make a very special\n\nSpeaker 1: exception for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only\n\nSpeaker 1: reason I'm doing this is I'm having some financial hardship\n\nSpeaker 2: and this is happening now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Frank, here's what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to tell you one thing. I'm going to make this special\n\nSpeaker 1: exception for you even though I do have a note that back in\n\nSpeaker 2: October you sent us cursing, attacking\n\nSpeaker 1: and angry emails\n\nSpeaker 2: and you posted them on our Facebook page.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to do that and I'm going to make a very special note that just for Frank\n\nSpeaker 2: we did a very special customer service and we\n\nSpeaker 1: did him a very big favor and you're going to acknowledge\n\nSpeaker 2: that I'm doing that very big thoughtful generous favor\n\nSpeaker 1: of just refunding you for a product we have not received\n\nSpeaker 2: back which is not our policy and that you\n\nSpeaker 1: do not intend moving forward\n\nSpeaker 2: with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I apologize for all of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: The lady that I talked to said she was fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: She knew where I was coming from because\n\nSpeaker 2: it took days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem. I'll do that. I don't have\n\nSpeaker 2: a problem with you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just processed your refund. I'm sorry you're going through\n\nSpeaker 2: some financial stuff and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should see that refund within these next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Frank. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
