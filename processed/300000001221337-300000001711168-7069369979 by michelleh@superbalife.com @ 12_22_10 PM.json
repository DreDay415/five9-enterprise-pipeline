    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I need to cancel my account. I've had enough of these worthless pills. Y'all took enough of my money.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let me help you out. No problem. Give me one second to pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Tom, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-11-65. Two days older than dirt.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're funny. Okay, I totally see what's wrong here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've just been receiving the generic Viagra. You did not receive the AGB. That's why it's not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, y'all been charging me 60-something dollars a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I see that. Do you happen to have the pills on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they're locked in my safe unit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem. They sent you the wrong medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: They probably ran out and then sent you generics and then continue to keep sending you generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second. 10-20-30-40-50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm going to send you out a replacement of the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to change it to 100 milligrams too. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't need for no more money to come out of my account. I can't afford no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's totally fine. Okay, so when you get this new bottle in the mail in a few days, this is how you're going to know it's the correct AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the bottle, it will say AGB, but it will also say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted on the pill is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now, your bottles definitely say APCO and your pill says AC340 or 390 on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds familiar, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and then I'm going to pause your refills for six months. I'm going to pause it until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I cancel you out now, it will delete your profile and the pharmacy would not get your replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm going to give you my extension so you can call me back and let me know how the AGB works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'll give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute. Let me make sure it writes. It don't write. It don't write. Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me find one that writes.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I found one that writes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Okay. It's 0020 and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0020 and Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Michelle. If you didn't have such a sexy voice, you wouldn't. I'd be one irate SOB, but I ain't going to be that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to be that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't hear my voice.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I'm the same way. I play music. I play guitar and sing.\n\nSpeaker 2: And everybody says, oh, that's great, that's great, that's great. I hate my voice. I hate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I love to sing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, hey, at least everybody else likes your voice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, really.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I don't hate mine so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: That makes me feel good that I've done something good for somebody.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did. Win-win today for both of us.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you had as pretty as you are, as your voice is beautiful, honey, all you'd have to do is talk and make you sleep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Blonde hair, blue eyes. 5'10\".\n\nSpeaker 2: Me too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, we got a lot in common. Heck yeah. Heck yeah. I'm a lesbian. Are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I love it. I love it. The only one I've ever heard, the only one I've ever heard that I like as much or more than that one is, let's put my penis between us.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to use that. That's a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tell me that ain't great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm totally going to use that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that was good. I need a laugh.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do have a beautiful voice, though, and you've got a great personality, and you're what keeps ignorant son-of-guns like me calm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I can be ignorant, and let me tell you, nobody can be more ignorant than me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some of it is uncalled for. People are so mad, and then they end up hanging up, and they're happy. I'm like, okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, I actually was. I actually was. I had my little pistol cocked and loaded and everything. Or, wait a minute, loaded and cocked and everything, because I was going broke, and there wasn't nothing happening.\n\nSpeaker 2: You heard me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, did you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw how many results you had, so I was like, no, no, let's fix this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, see, right along with that is I spent two different times, I spent an hour, over an hour on hold trying to get through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I thought, this is a scam. This is just a scam. You can't get through to cancel, because they won't let you cancel with a damn email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can't. Yeah, you've got to call in. But now you have my extension, so you'll move to the top of my list. And then we're open Pacific hours, so we're open 8 to 5, which is what, 11 to 8 p.m. your time, and we're closed on the weekends.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I tell you what, I'd just about give you half of what y'all have been taking out of my check just to talk to you every week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said just about, because my wife would not go for it at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But nevertheless, nevertheless, she knows I'm an idiot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: She knows I act this way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That makes life fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, hey, I have a prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm talking about a crazy prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got one of them, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the way of the world nowadays, ain't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: How old are you? Would you mind if I asked?\n\nSpeaker 1: 41.\n\nSpeaker 2: 41.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm 60. I'm two days older than damn dirt, and it pisses me off.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's not old.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it makes me feel great that I'm still alive, you know? God let me live.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I had a quadruple bypass.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've had cancer and got rid of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had a damn aortic aneurysm and got rid of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Went through it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They've done a lot of shit to try to take me out lately.\n\nSpeaker 1: God put you on this earth for a reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right, and I don't think it was to be limp.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, definitely not.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could conquer this, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just like... Do you know what a eunuch is?\n\nSpeaker 1: It sounds familiar, but no, I can't say it.\n\nSpeaker 2: A eunuch is what the Egyptians...\n\nSpeaker 1: Back in the Egyptian days, they would take their slaves\n\nSpeaker 2: and they would take their genital fun parts out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I used to tell people all the time,\n\nSpeaker 2: when I was thinking telling bitches around without a fun button.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, your fun button. I love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's got to have a fun button.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's got to.\n\nSpeaker 2: They still do that shit in parts of the world. It's crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, God. I couldn't... Oh, Lord.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, oh, hell no. Like, why live?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just playing, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you don't pay no attention to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry if I've offended you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am truly, truly sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you haven't offended me whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if I haven't offended you, then you're as sick as I am\n\nSpeaker 1: and we need to meet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally. I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: What part of the world are you in? I need to find you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, God. You're not one of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm born and raised here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm not one of them, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm a Trump supporter.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. That's my girl.\n\nSpeaker 2: I knew I liked you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew from the moment you said hello,\n\nSpeaker 2: I knew I was going to like you.\n\nSpeaker 1: God damn it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because Trump's my hero.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, hell yeah, he is.\n\nSpeaker 2: All these people with ICE, I'm like, leave them the fuck alone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, you think you're going to go mess with the feds and they don't...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, God. Shoot them. Just fucking shoot them.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm screaming. That's what I'm screaming.\n\nSpeaker 1: Breaking the law is breaking the law.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: We ain't breaking no laws, are we?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No, we're fucking legal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, no, yeah, we are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we was, I was having fun and I didn't want to stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just kidding. I'm just playing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle, it has been wonderful talking to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: God, it's been wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 1: I needed a laugh and it sounds like you needed a laugh, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm one funny son of a bitch, let me tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are one funny mother effer.\n\nSpeaker 2: You think I'm funny just in audio, you're seeing video.\n\nSpeaker 1: I taped me once and I could not erase it fast enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day, hon.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Love you, dear. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Love you, too. Bye.",
