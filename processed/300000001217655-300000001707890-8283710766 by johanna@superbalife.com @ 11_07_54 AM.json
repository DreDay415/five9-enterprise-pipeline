    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi there. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you today, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I had ordered some, the the—\n\nSpeaker 1: Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: Online with you guys, to score blue, and they shipped again.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a one-time purchase and somehow they turned it into a subscription. Can we cancel that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me pull up your account. Can I get your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, it's William Mandel. Date of birth is 12-25—\n\nSpeaker 2: 1951.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mandel. I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just wanted to be clear that we're not a subscription—\n\nSpeaker 1: We're actually a telehealth—\n\nSpeaker 2: So when the doctor wrote the prescription, he made that available with refills, and—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can actually determine the frequency and quantity that you want to receive as our VIP customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have full, full control over when and how many you receive?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can also put a pause on your account for up to six months at any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor wrote the prescription with refills so that when you want to place a future order, we can fulfill that order with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the problem—\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the problem was I received the order and then they shipped it again without any authorization.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, because currently your account is set up to receive refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can remove that and I can adjust that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that was not supposed to be done; that was done on your end, not on my end.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, that most recent order you did receive it, right? Because it shipped out, it says it was delivered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just received it. I didn't know why I received it because nobody ordered it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I sure didn't ask for a repeat—\n\nSpeaker 1: Subscription for prescription when I ordered the one-time trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, okay, and how did you like the results you got from the Viagra 50 milligram?\n\nSpeaker 1: Haven't tried them yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you haven't had an opportunity to try it yet. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I do apologize that your account was set up that way when you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Signed up. Oh, I can remove that so that that doesn't happen again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want me to set it up or put a hold on it until July? That way you can call in when you want—\n\nSpeaker 1: To place an order once you have an opportunity to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I'm fine. I just wanted to try it, you know, so there's no need for follow-ups.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just can't cancel it 100%, and if I want more, I will call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, so again, if you plan on getting more, and I know you haven't had an opportunity to try it yet—\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you do plan on placing a future refill, I would recommend keeping your prescription—\n\nSpeaker 1: Available and on hold. That way you can call in and we can—\n\nSpeaker 2: Fulfill that order with the pharmacy. Because if I cancel you out entirely, it will cancel that current prescription and all available—\n\nSpeaker 1: Refills, which means that, you know, in a couple of months when you want to get another order—\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not going to have an active prescription available for you because your account will be canceled. I also—\n\nSpeaker 1: You—\n\nSpeaker 2: Are using my credit card, fortunately this shipped to me when I don't order it. I don't want anything to do with your company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we are FDA approved and the best eating medication on the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you don't have a change of heart once you have an opportunity to try the Viagra that we sent you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because what, it's exclusive? You won't be able to get this AGV anywhere else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, well, thank you, appreciate it. Have a great day. Bye. Bye.",
