I was trying to purchase?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can help you out, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a mistake.

Timothy Waller?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, your order went through, sir, yesterday. The order's on its way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good to go. The agent's in care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be there on Saturday, they say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, they keep sending me e-mails saying that it failed to go through.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, with so many deception things going on,\n\nSpeaker 1: you want to make sure you're paying the right people.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Yeah, I know. Your order did go through with us, Mr. Waller.\n\nSpeaker 1: The order is on its way. It has a tracking. It says it will be there by Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: No issues, brother. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Bye-bye.",
