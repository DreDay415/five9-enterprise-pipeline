    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I went to place an order today and it was telling me to update my payment message for $38.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I wanted to know what that was.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to know what was that pending for.\n\nSpeaker 2: So for some reason, maybe you have a new payment information or the card got damaged.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the system is not able to process with the current card and file.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you have a different form of payment or updated card, we can update that so you can place your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it's telling me to update it to make a $38 payment,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I want to know what are they trying to take $38 for.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need that question answered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that was for a refill, for one of your refill, your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just weird because I don't see an option for any $38 refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the number just doesn't add up to any of the options that I was looking at.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last time, how much did you pay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you remember?\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you paid $37 here and $0.14, so basically $38.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I just wanted to make sure that's what it's for.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that was for what amount was that for?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was Viagra 100 mg, 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, okay, I do want to place the order, but I want to change the shipping method,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm afraid that if I update the card and they take that, then it would be too late to fix anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what are my options here?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we can update the shipping address and then update your payment information.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, not the address, the shipping method.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I do that if I update my information, but it processes the shipment before I can do anything?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, he's not going to do that because I'm going to have to do that manually with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to add the card information, and when I place the order,\n\nSpeaker 1: it gives me the option to choose how you want to get that shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can we do that then?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm ready when you are for the payment information,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we're going to place the order with the shipping method that you like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what do you need from me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I need to unlock my card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the problem with the card is that it's unlocked.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we're going to have to reenter that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so let me get my wallet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I am ready when you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to stop this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm waiting for it to unlock the bad signal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I am sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: That number is 4403-9348-2800.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: That number is 4403-9348-2801-1655.\n\nSpeaker 2: And expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-27.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the code in the back?\n\nSpeaker 1: 991.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now I'm going to try to place your order here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to be giving you a custom price, so I'm going to have to adjust the price for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what type of shipping method would you like?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: What were the options for shipping?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can do one-day air shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's $38.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two-day air shipping is $28.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or priority mail, one-to-three business day for $15.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do the $15.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's going to be with USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's one-to-three business day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Keep in mind, today it's Thursday, and we have the weekend around the corner.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to place your order right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did a custom price, because the 10-piece costs more than that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've got to custom your price, and then I'm applying the $15 for the priority mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to process the order right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was able to process your order for your 10-piece with priority mail, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much was that?\n\nSpeaker 1: So $37.15.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
