    "text": "Speaker 1: How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, is this Gabrielle?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, hi.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Tom.\n\nSpeaker 2: I called about a half hour, 45 minutes ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were driving, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I remember you, Tom.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if we can go ahead and get that order taken care of,\n\nSpeaker 2: that'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: So which one were you trying to order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Buy one, get one free for $49.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Buy two, get two free for $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it was the buy one, get one free.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, that's the one you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then let's just confirm your address.\n\nSpeaker 2: 145 Ridge Church Road, Berlin, Pennsylvania, 15530.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And can I charge the Visa ending in 0250?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've got another one, but it's a MasterCard.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the card number?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, it's 5113-3212-2713-7406.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-33.\n\nSpeaker 1: CVV number?\n\nSpeaker 2: The security code is 863.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me that card number one more time.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, 5113-3212-2713-7406.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so for some reason, it's saying declined, Thomas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why would it be declined?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said expiration date is 0-2-20-33, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0-2-3-3, security code 863.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, yeah, that's what I have.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's saying declined.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not letting me know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just says declined from my end.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's a prepaid credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that matter, because I just paid or just bought it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that might be the reason why.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes when you try to purchase supplements or medicine\n\nSpeaker 1: with prepaid cards, for some reason,\n\nSpeaker 2: they don't tend to go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes they do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes they don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just did my last order on the one bottle, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That was with a prepaid credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did see that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, like I said, it just depends.\n\nSpeaker 1: It really varies when it comes to prepaid cards.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a different card?\n\nSpeaker 1: We could possibly try a different card.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I just bought this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I bought it for this purpose, so I've\n\nSpeaker 2: had a couple bad purchases that didn't go through\n\nSpeaker 1: or I didn't get the product at all, scans, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when I tried the one bottle and I was waiting to get it,\n\nSpeaker 1: of course, through some of the bad experiences I've had,\n\nSpeaker 2: I just didn't want my wife to even know about this.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was going to try it first to see if it worked.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's why I ordered the one bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I saw that you had the special,\n\nSpeaker 1: then I figured I'd just go buy another $50 gift card.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then like I did the last time for the one bottle\n\nSpeaker 1: and put it on this time, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, how much is on the gift card?\n\nSpeaker 1: $50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that might be the reason why, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: because the total's coming out to $59.90.\n\nSpeaker 2: $59?\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought it was $49 something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it's $49.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then shipping is $9.95, so it comes out to $59.90.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so they didn't charge shipping on the last one,\n\nSpeaker 1: then, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it went through and left me $0.10 or $0.05 or $0.10\n\nSpeaker 1: on the card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe that's why the shipping's taking so long on that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it looks like they charged you the $59.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a $50 gift card, and it left $0.05 or $0.10 on the card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: They charged you the $49.90.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what they charged you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I'm able to pause this thing like this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't care if it's slowboating,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't care if it's slowboating like the last order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's, what, three weeks?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so I'm not even watching you, the shipping,\n\nSpeaker 2: right now, but it's still not going through.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it tends to happen a lot with gift cards.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, with gift cards, it could either be a yes,\n\nSpeaker 1: it goes through, or no, it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's because you're purchasing a supplement.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what you can go ahead and do is\n\nSpeaker 2: contact the merchant of the card and let\n\nSpeaker 1: them know that you're trying to make a transaction to purchase\n\nSpeaker 2: a supplement, but it's not going through.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, well, I'll do that right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then hopefully they can clear it\n\nSpeaker 1: and get back to me or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and they can give us a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I should have just got another season.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe that makes a difference, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, like I said, it just varies\n\nSpeaker 2: when it comes to prepaid cards.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, OK, Thomas, so give them a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, you're welcome, Mike.",
