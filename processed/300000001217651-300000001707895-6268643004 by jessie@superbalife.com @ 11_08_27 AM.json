    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: First is Eric, E-R-I-C, and last is Navarette, N-A-V-A-R-R-E-T-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Mr. Navarette, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 89074.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're at 339 Humboldt South Drive in Henderson, Nevada, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, super. All right, so you recently placed an order yesterday, the doctor approved it, and this should be shipping out shortly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I noticed that there's an automatic refill, and I don't want to have that automatic refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, no, no, no, absolutely. Let me just take a look there. This here should just be – let me set it up so it's – what is this?\n\nSpeaker 1: As needed, so you can order whenever you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear with me a moment, but I also want to make sure you still have access to your refills and that your prescription remains active.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so what I've done here is this. I've basically frozen everything for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: All that means is you can order whenever you like. You're not going to get some rando stuff in the mail, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: To keep your prescription active, in the event you do not place an order in six months' time,\n\nSpeaker 1: you get one refill at the end of six months to keep your prescription active, and that's it. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I even call – are you going to notify me? Because I might forget.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, no, no, absolutely. You should get a notification.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will you let me know ahead of time, hey, your refill's coming up, or are you going to notify me my refill's on the way?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you should get something like – notification should be ahead of time. It should be about five days ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Before it's sent out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no way to just remove the six – so what you're saying is that once you remove that six-month thing\n\nSpeaker 1: or whatever the case may be, that cancels the whole prescription. Is that what you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I didn't care for it, I don't like it, I can call before that and say, hey, you know what, just cancel the whole thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, anything else?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye, everybody.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
