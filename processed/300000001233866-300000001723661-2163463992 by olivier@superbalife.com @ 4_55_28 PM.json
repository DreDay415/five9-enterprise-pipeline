I'm trying to cancel any future prescriptions being sent to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Ronald?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any health concerns, or you just don't need it for a while? You want to hold it as needed? You have a lot left.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want any more. Period. I want it canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. I was asking because they offer you to pause so you can keep your price and reorder it.\n\nSpeaker 2: They don't have to pay a new doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you want, I can cancel the one they finance for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing, if anything changes in the future, your price will be higher, obviously, because they're going to have to reinvest for a new doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine. Your product doesn't work, so I want it canceled. I don't want any more ties.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. I wish you would have told us that before so we would have given you something better.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I cancel everything for you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually, it's better to communicate your issues so we can fix it, offer you a better solution, a better fit.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when we don't know, we can help, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I called and talked to people two deliveries ago and told them to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got a new prescription in the mail. I want it canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything will be canceled, sir. Fully canceled. You're fully canceled here already.\n\nSpeaker 1: I cancel everything for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing to worry about, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
