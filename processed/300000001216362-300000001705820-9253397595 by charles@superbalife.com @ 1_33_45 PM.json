I got an order that I see\n\nSpeaker 2: that went through yesterday and I want to cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second. Andrew Upman in California. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And you said you just don't need this next shipment?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't. I just want to cancel the whole account too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Just canceled everything for the future. This one has already left our facility already.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's in USPS's hands. So when it arrives, don't tear it up. Don't do anything to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All you need to do is write return to sender on it. Put it back in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: The mailman will take it next time he comes by. Send it back to us and then we'll issue the refund\n\nSpeaker 2: as soon as we have it back in our possession.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you. Bye.",
