    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Richard Smith, and I have an account with you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put in a small order back in December of the past year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's 1st, 25th, 49th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you put in an order on December 13th, and then you just put in an order on January 13th,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the note from the pharmacy says,\n\nSpeaker 2: please verify if patient is okay to take tablets that contain lactose.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what they're waiting on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I didn't. I mean, I got okays from y'all.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got an e-mail from you guys on 12-20th saying great news.\n\nSpeaker 2: You had told me you needed some more information, and I sent them a thing that I had an appointment with a doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I see what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you put on your allergies, you put milk intolerance, and I guess there's lactose in the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why they were waiting for you to respond to make sure you knew it was okay that the tablet contained lactose.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I take. I have lactose pills, and yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just a very mild allergy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I do it without even taking lactose pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I eat milk and have milk and different products.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I ate cheese the other day, and I'd pay him for it today.\n\nSpeaker 2: For a lot of people, I'm barking, and mine is not too bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I used to eat cheese all the time, but I became a lactard out of nowhere, and it sucks.\n\nSpeaker 2: I love cheese, and I ate some last night.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. No, I had a stomachache today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Richard, I also see you just paid $55 for a quantity of four just regular, plain, generic 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to cancel these out and issue you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, actually, I'm going to, because right now, you didn't even get the new AGV, which is the latest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and a quantity of 10 is only $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to do the math.\n\nSpeaker 1: What should I do?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to cancel those out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead of issuing a refund for both of them and then charging our card again, I'm going to issue you, I'm going to refund you the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: So give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: $54.95 times 2.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's $109.90, and then minus, it's $63.95 for a quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I owe you $45.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where are you located?\n\nSpeaker 1: Our office is in Los Angeles, but we ship out from Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, our pharmacy is in Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you just kind of right above me there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, y'all just went through some hell, didn't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I got family in Tennessee, and they are still without power from the freeze.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Seriously?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled those out without a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now let me get you the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Quantity of – okay, now we're – I'm going to – do you want to switch it to 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all the same price, and you could break them in half.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 10, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: There we go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, enable.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not charging you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your address is 1901 Highway 190, apartment 1225?\n\nSpeaker 1: It sure is, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, add note, and then let me put a note.\n\nSpeaker 2: Patient is fine with lactose.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I found – I make a lot of different – I'll cook a lot just piddling around,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I have a lot – I have a sweet tooth, and I make a lot of desserts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, nice.\n\nSpeaker 2: That use whipped cream.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's really weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got some icebox pies and some chocolate icebox pies I make that use a whole lot of\n\nSpeaker 1: eight ounces of whipped cream, and I never have to take anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't bother me a damn bit, and I don't really understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: It seems like they're just certain milk products that might bother me, but there are\n\nSpeaker 2: others that don't bother me at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I have the same exact problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like feta cheese – yeah, feta cheese doesn't bother me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goat cheese – it's just like if I eat too much mozzarella, and then I can't eat\n\nSpeaker 2: yogurt anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, damn.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I can't eat ice cream.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will screw me up big time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I used to be able to eat, you know –\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, how about lactose ice cream?\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't try that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That works good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it does.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it's not quite as good, but I mean –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It at least helps.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, it does.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm messing you all up.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, my computer's messing you up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nine, nine, five, three, three, four.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, there we go.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pull up your count again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that order went in, and now I need to issue your refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle, do they do reviews?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do y'all –\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish they did, but no, they don't do reviews.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll tell you what, I would give you an A+.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm serious.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man, I deal a lot of online stuff, and I swear, man, I get damn Indians and Asians.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't understand them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my God, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whenever you call, and they're like an Indian, and you're like, oh, God.\n\nSpeaker 1: Didn't I just talk to a North Korean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've had to ask for different people sometimes because I honestly cannot understand them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Never filled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Placed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Went out.\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Refunding.\n\nSpeaker 2: Different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Submit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, successfully refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're going to be seeing – what was it?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was $45.95 back on your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes it takes up to 10 business days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I placed the order for the 100 milligrams of a quantity of 10 of the AGVs,\n\nSpeaker 1: so they'll be shipping that out to you tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to tell you – so it comes with a quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes with automatic refills on a monthly basis,\n\nSpeaker 2: which you do not have to have now that you have VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have an option.\n\nSpeaker 2: A lot of people just like to pause that for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your prescription active\n\nSpeaker 2: and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you set that up?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the way I want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to pause it until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just put that in your calendar because they don't send you a reminder.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't need a refill by then, call us and you can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, if July the 31st, just do it before then, really.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because if not, they would send you a quantity of 10 for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Ellen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can give you my extension too if you need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take it, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm waiting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0020, and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Michelle, it was a pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, Rich.\n\nSpeaker 1: And thank you, seriously, thank you so much for helping me, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not a problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you have a good evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, save me some money.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you tell them they need to put a damn review in.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's important now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm telling you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is.\n\nSpeaker 2: It really is.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you know, sometimes I get off the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: By the time I'm done getting off the phone, I'm like, I want to do a survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, I get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I do it sometimes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't try and be nasty to people.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand if they got a damn accent and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No shit, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's very hard to deal with, you know, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, thanks again.\n\nSpeaker 1: I get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great evening.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.",
