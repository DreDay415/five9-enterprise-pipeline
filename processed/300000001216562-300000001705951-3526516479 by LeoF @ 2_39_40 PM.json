    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hi. I just received a bottle of Scorablue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I already have a whole bottle here, but it doesn't really work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't know why I got another one. I didn't order another one.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name, please, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: First name is Brian, B-R-Y-A-N. Last name is Aranicki, A-R-A-N-I-E-C-K-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I see what's going on here, Brian.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like on the last order you got set up on our VIP prescription to receive a refill 90 days after the initial.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that was way too soon for you. You're saying you didn't get much effect out of the medicine?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got two pills out of the other one. I can send it all back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow. Yeah, definitely.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you didn't want to keep that order, you can send it back, and I'll get your refund on it, of course, the one that just came in.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first one, too, honestly, if you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you're saying you didn't get any effect, Brian.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have heard a few other guys, like I've been talking, I've been taking these calls all day,\n\nSpeaker 1: a few other guys have told me the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to make sure you got the correct pills there, though, actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have those pills there with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you mind taking one of those pills out of the bottle for me and let me know what the medication, what the marking on the actual pill says?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says AC7.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so that is incorrect if it says AC7.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that is, that is a generic Viagra, but it's very similar to, like, the pills the guys get from the VA.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not the AGV that you should have gotten, so that's incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I could do for you, Brian, instead of cancel the account, I mean, you can send that order back, the one that just came,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I can get you a refund on that, of course, if you don't want to keep it.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's no problem there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send instructions on your email on how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I was going to say, instead of cancel the account, if you want, what I can do is send you a replacement order for that first 40,\n\nSpeaker 2: that first batch of 40 that you had.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll pause the account for another six months for you to let you try those out,\n\nSpeaker 2: see if you do want to place a refill in that amount of time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to offer you that before I did a finalized cancellation or anything like that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm just going to go to my doctor and have him describe me something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought this, because I read everything about it, and it seemed like it was a great deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was like, okay, this might work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I talked to my doctor about it, and he said, why did you do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have a heart attack.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll send you the return instructions.\n\nSpeaker 1: No issue there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you didn't want me to send you those pills out as a replacement for Freedon?\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are these here?\n\nSpeaker 2: These are the same ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are the ones you just sent me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so those are the ones we're going to have you refuse and send back if you don't want to keep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're the same number as the first one.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I was going to say if you wanted to give it another shot, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could pause the account for you, send you that replacement order, and then go from there,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you wanted to give it another shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want to try that again.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to cancel this out for you then, and you're all set, Brian.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just send that order back, and we'll get your refund on it when it comes back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so you want both bottles, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you don't want either one, yeah, send them both back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because they're not doing nothing for me at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Matter of fact, I took the two pills, well, one not right away, but it gave me a headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your thing said it doesn't give you a headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, some people do still experience that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I always tell guys to hydrate really well, and that can mitigate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then that's usually what I like to tell guys to help that out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, some people do still experience it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I sent you instructions and everything there, Brian, so you'll see those when you check your e-mail, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Check your e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I got it here.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, we're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
