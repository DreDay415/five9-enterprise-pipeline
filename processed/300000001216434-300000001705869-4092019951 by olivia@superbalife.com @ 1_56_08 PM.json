    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Bo Matthews.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Bo. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Doing good. How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. Thank you for asking. How can I help you today, Bo?\n\nSpeaker 2: On December 29th, I made an order to y'all, and it was $163.95, and that was for, I don't know, how much of the Viagra does that cover, just the first bottle?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is 40 pills. And then the screen popped up that offered you an option to add double the order for 50% off, and you said no.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it said, do you want to do half of the order for 50% off or 44.70, and you clicked yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that should have given you 60 pills total.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Then what was the other charge for 24.99?\n\nSpeaker 2: That was 50% off of 50% of the order add-on, because the base order is for 40 pills, and then 44.70 was 50% off of an additional upgrade of 20 more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And like I said, so what was the 24.99 for?\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have a 24.99 charge for you. We just have those two charges, the original $163.95 and then the 44.70.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, let me find out who's done this, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Bo. I hope you have a great day. Yeah, thanks. Bye.",
