How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I want to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Corey, C-O-R-E-Y, and V as in Victor, I-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Corey, I did hear that you placed an order three days ago, and what's going on? Is it that you have...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I... so I... well, I will try it when... because you guys already know that, and I already paid for the first one, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: but I spoke with my actual doctor, and none of what you guys advertise is...\n\nSpeaker 2: whether they're not FDA approved, none of that, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra is FDA approved by Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but you guys are... it's not actual Viagra, it's generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's still generic is what it stands for, authorized generic Viagra, A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't know, I just... I talked to my doctor, but...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's alright, I'm actually just going to go through my doctor, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, this is actually better than what they would prescribe you at your doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but...\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to say, are you sure before making any changes? I can go ahead and just pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can pause it until April so that you have enough time to try it and see how you like it, which I'm pretty sure you're going to love it,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the A-G-V is the best thing that there is when it comes to E.T. medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, but I would just like to cancel it for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the thing is that you haven't tried it yet, Corey, so I do suggest you just to pause it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't understand why you're trying to talk me into using it instead of just canceling it when I asked to cancel it, like you're trying to oversell it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you cancel it right now, let's say we do end up liking it, because you canceled it,\n\nSpeaker 1: it means you wouldn't be able to reorder with us in the future because you would be canceling it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I take them for fun, so really it doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're trying to oversell something that I'm just asking you to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't got to try to sell it to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, I understand what you're saying, but I would like to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If not, I'll just call my bank if I have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I figured I could cancel it through you guys, but if I have to call my bank and have them just stop payment,\n\nSpeaker 2: then that's what I'll have to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if I cancel it...\n\nSpeaker 2: You should just be like, yeah, we will cancel it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, just be aware you're not going to be able to reorder with us in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, that's all right, perfectly fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, have a nice day.
