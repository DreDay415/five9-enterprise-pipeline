    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Scott Billingham, let me give you an order number.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's okay Scott, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-20-1945.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, I see your profile pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Looks like you cancelled, but it looks like there's a refill, did you need that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what I want to get straightened out, when I went to order it on the website,\n\nSpeaker 2: it said it was the original new Viagra HEV at a price of $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they don't, okay, so the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I know they don't include that, so that's why a quantity of 10 comes out to $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which item am I ordering here, is it this AGV you're touting, or is it my old prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it looks like you have one at the pharmacy that is not the AGV, it's your old prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then cancel that, I'm not interested in that, I thought I was getting the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, did you call in and talk to somebody today?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, give me one second, I'm going to cancel this out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I cancelled that out, and then did you want to order the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, perfect, that went through, so they'll be shipping that out to you tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now what's the price on that one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's going to be $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Same price?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but this is the stuff that they say works in 11 minutes?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so people say they feel it kick in in 11 to 15 minutes, but on the bottle it will\n\nSpeaker 1: say take one hour prior to get the full results, and then it lasts in your system longer, it\n\nSpeaker 2: lasts for 14 hours, and less side effects are being reported, especially less headaches\n\nSpeaker 1: and less of that flushed feeling.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to make sure what I was getting here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what order is this one now?\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is going to be the AGV, quantity of 10, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there an order number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's A-6-2-2-8-1-A-3-1-3.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me repeat that back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's A-6-2-2-8-1-A-3-1-3.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's the same order number we just canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it replaced that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will populate a new order number tomorrow, so I will make a note to call you back and\n\nSpeaker 2: give you the correct order number.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I should have done is just canceled your other one without a refund, but now the accounting\n\nSpeaker 2: software makes us wait 24 hours, so then what I can do is just, I'll call you back tomorrow\n\nSpeaker 1: at, well, it's 2 o'clock my time.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that, 5 o'clock your time?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, tell you what, send me an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have my email address, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, b-l-l-n-g-h-m-scott-at-a-o-l.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: By the way, how do I go about changing my email address with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I can do it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your new email?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, it is unlisted, it's u-n-l-i-s-t-e-d addresses, a-d-d-r-e-s-s-s, it's three s's.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I got unlisted, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: A-o-l.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I have unlisted addresses, a-d-d-r-e-s-s-s, at aol.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, of course it's all run together as one word.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now the pharmacy will email you, now you'll receive the tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, update, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll shoot you an email tomorrow right after 2 p.m., or right after 5 p.m. your time,\n\nSpeaker 2: to confirm that your order went through, and I'll give you the order number as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now I'm logging in.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can give you my name and extension as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, would you please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now when I go to log in, do I use my new email address that I just gave you,\n\nSpeaker 2: or do I use the one you have?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, I know what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a send password reset email.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you this so it goes to your new email address.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can access it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you should be getting an email any second to your new email address\n\nSpeaker 2: to just change your password.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you have any issues, you have my extension, so you can just call me back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm here until 3 p.m., so 6 p.m. your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I'll double check it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll send you an email or give you a call back tomorrow to, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: give you an update about your new order number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah, if you would send me an email because I'm not going to be available.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll make sure to send you an email tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good luck.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
