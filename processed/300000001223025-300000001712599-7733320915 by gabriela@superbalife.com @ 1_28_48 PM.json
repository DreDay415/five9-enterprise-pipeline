    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra, how can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to look into placing another order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Samuel Jones, 8/26/7.\n\nSpeaker 1: Date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Okay, and how many pills of Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: would you like to go ahead and purchase? If you want to go ahead and do\n\nSpeaker 2: the 10 for 49, 25 for 99, or the 40 for 149?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do the\n\nSpeaker 2: 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: 25?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. That's the most they come with, right? 100?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. 100 milligrams would be the highest dosage. And Samuel, is your shipping address\n\nSpeaker 2: still the same? 2229 Barrett Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Illinois 60102?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and can I touch the MasterCard ending in 0580?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I wanted to do 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, just do 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: 10?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 for 49?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, place that order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great, Samuel, you're all set. I was able to successfully\n\nSpeaker 2: place that order for you, so you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and this is not, I'm not going to be automatically\n\nSpeaker 1: billed after a certain time, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a prescription, Samuel,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it does come with a monthly interval. It doesn't necessarily have to be every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can go ahead and modify that to your preference, but\n\nSpeaker 1: it just has to have an interval, whether that's every month, every two months,\n\nSpeaker 2: every three months, every four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what is it on now? A quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's usually enough supply for a month, but if you do not need it\n\nSpeaker 1: every month, you can adjust it to every two months, every three months, just how I mentioned.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have to do that, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: How would I do that? I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you let me\n\nSpeaker 2: know what interval you want, I can go ahead and adjust it right now that we're on\n\nSpeaker 1: the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I just didn't want any\n\nSpeaker 1: interval until I kind of tested out to see if it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, you do have to have a monthly interval because\n\nSpeaker 2: it's a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So if you want, I can adjust\n\nSpeaker 2: it right now to every two months, and then you can test\n\nSpeaker 1: it out and have enough time to try it and see how you like it\n\nSpeaker 2: and see whether you want to continue every two months or adjust it to every three months\n\nSpeaker 1: or change it to every month, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just have it on\n\nSpeaker 2: every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So you're all set. I modified it\n\nSpeaker 2: to every two months for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you're all set. Have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye.",
