Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I see you here. Now, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6-25-53.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, yeah, so I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're located at 5429 Ralston in Raytown, Missouri.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular monthly refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order,\n\nSpeaker 2: if it is before then, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm done. Not only does it not work, but my chest is going to explode, so I'm done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. I'm so sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. All right, Jack, well, your prescription is canceled,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I would say you know where to find us, but that sounds pretty serious.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know if you'll find us again, but you do know where to find us just in case,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, never mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: There was – well, I started all this, I saw a notice on my credit card statement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And will that be removed or?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so good question.\n\nSpeaker 2: So because that refill was placed yesterday, it hasn't –\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't confirm that it's been shipped out, but there's a pretty high likelihood.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want me to, I can message shipping, and I can ask them, and they will get back to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: The trouble is they will get back to me somewhere between the next 30 minutes\n\nSpeaker 2: and the next two to three hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: So unfortunately, we won't still be on the phone, but I can say,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, guys, if you haven't sent this out yet, can you cancel it? Let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they will let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if we're able to cancel it, then yes, I can refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If not, because there is a pretty high chance they've already sent it out,\n\nSpeaker 2: then I will email you also.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll email you no matter what, one way or the other,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you'll either get an email from me saying, hey, I was able to catch it in time\n\nSpeaker 1: and cancel it for you, and I refunded you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or, hey, I wasn't, but you're going to receive it in like four or five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you receive a package from GoGoMets, as long as you do not open it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can just write return to sender on the package, and leave it in your post box.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as long as it's unopened, and they can read that return to sender message,\n\nSpeaker 2: your post person will bring it right back to us, and we can just refund you once we receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course. All right, Jack. Great. So I just messaged the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, they will let me know soon. And yeah, I'll follow up with you later on in the day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
