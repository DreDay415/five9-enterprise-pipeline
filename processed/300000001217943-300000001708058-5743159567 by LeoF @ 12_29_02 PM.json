    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Monte Bartz, and I'm calling in regards to qualifying for, I don't know\n\nSpeaker 1: if it's, is it just Viagra and all you people deal with, or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell Cialis as well, but yeah, Viagra's our big seller currently.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, is the, is the A-G-V Viagra available?\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, if you wanted to place an order for the A-G-V, I could take an order for you, that's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is the minimal amount?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the smallest amount we sell are 10 pills for $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: $49 for 10, are those, what is the milligrams on them?\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 or 100, actually we have 25 too, so whatever you prefer, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know, I've never used them, so I don't...\n\nSpeaker 1: Most people go with the higher dose, but if you wanted to start with 50s, you're more than welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is 100 the same price as the 50s?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they are, they're all the same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh, well that, to me, why wouldn't a guy go for the 100?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, most people do, definitely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what kind of information do you need?\n\nSpeaker 1: So Mr. Bartz, it looks like I already have a little bit of information from you, you went through that medical survey,\n\nSpeaker 2: so what I would need is just your address now, and then I'd take your payment information as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and the payment is a credit card, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sort of worry about my credit card handed out to some other people.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, so we are security encrypted, we definitely don't sell people's information or anything like that, we only sell the medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you wanted to, I mean, you're more than welcome to place the order online, but I can do it for you over the phone if you're ready now as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, so if I got the 100s, it would be, how many doses would be?\n\nSpeaker 1: 10, if you wanted to get 10, we do 25 as well, but if you wanted the smallest amount, that's 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 10 pills for 49, or 50 bucks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, shipping included on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: So your total price out the door will be $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's for shipping?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's actually a pharmacy fee, so the pharmacy's third party, they charge us $30, we pay $15.05, the customer pays $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV, I'm from Indiana, and I have a urologist in Indianapolis at an IU, and they don't have a clue about AGV, Viagra. Why is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what it is, is it's the authorized generic version of the pill from Pfizer, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's probably like a ton of physicians, doctors, medical practitioners out there who don't know about the pill, just because they're probably just not aware of just all the different pills that are out there on the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just there's a ton of different people who are putting medicine out like this, like your urologist probably can prescribe you the Viagra from a specific manufacturer that I would have no idea about, and then vice versa, and then there's just tons of people getting pills from tons of different places.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's probably what that is.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this isn't – they claim it's 11 minutes, if I remember correctly, to kill activity, and then it's good for 14 hours, versus the other Viagra is – what's the readout on those?\n\nSpeaker 2: So your regular branded and generic Viagra can take anywhere from like an hour to like 60 to 90 minutes to kick in, and will last in your system for anywhere between four to six hours, maybe like eight if you're really lucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you think? Is my urologist, when she gets a Viagra from a pharmacy, is it going to be the same quality of Viagra that this one is?\n\nSpeaker 1: Definitely not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Definitely not. So we're the only people with FDA-approved medications, so if you're getting Viagra or anything from generic Viagra anywhere else, other than the branded blue pill, it's just not regulated by the FDA.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's just sold to that vendor or to your doctor or whoever from like a specific vendor who's like, hey, we'll pay you guys all this money, go sell all these pills, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it's just hard to say where the pills come from, from like your doctor or urologist or even like at your hospital pharmacy or your local pharmacy or the Walmart. It's just hard to say where they're sourced from, but we're the only ones with this FDA-approved version of the pill, basically is why we do so well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I went through the injecting part of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've heard that works really well.\n\nSpeaker 2: You say what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've heard that works really well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really?\n\nSpeaker 2: At least for me. No, it was awful. Every time I would inject, I would get very little results, so that made me want to increase, and I just kept increasing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was at 62, 63 units of injection, and I was getting zero, well, I'm not going to say zero results, but it wasn't effective enough to be, for me to have sex, it wasn't effective for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm just done with it. It's just not good. So, either these AGVs work, or I'm going to get an implant.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't know if you know anything about the implants, but they seem to be, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been doing a lot of reading on them and things, and I can see where they're very beneficial.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, anyway, why don't we try the AGVs and the 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, just 10 pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 pills, yeah, the minimal amount.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, perfect. All right, if that was the case, Mr. Bartz, I could take your address then, your shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's 3200 South, 500 East, Rochester, Indiana, 46975.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. You said 3200 South, 500 East, Rochester, Indiana, 46975.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, and then I can take your card number whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4147-2027-8213-8885.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4147-2133-8885. 1130.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, gosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1130, perfect. No worries. Sorry about that. And the code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, gosh. 767.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, perfect. I'm going to go ahead and place this order for you now. Give me just a moment, Mr. Bartz.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, your order has been successfully placed. You're going to see that process ship out and arrive in the next three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should see that process really quickly. It will be shipped out tomorrow. We're done shipping for the day just because it's going to be a little later in the day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you'll see that arrive probably by Friday, I'd say, Mr. Bartz. We'll get a confirmation and track the number when it ships. Then you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we'll see how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, thank you. Looking forward to it. Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, bye.",
