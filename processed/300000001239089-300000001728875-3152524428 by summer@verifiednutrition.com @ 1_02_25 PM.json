So I notified the pharmacy that it was a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they need to release it because they were holding it to the end of the month. But I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Notified them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why would they hold it to the end of the month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because pharmaceutical laws, you can't have a certain amount of pills within a short time—\n\nSpeaker 2: Frame. And to them, they already sent you 25 and you can't get another order of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can't get a certain amount of pills within a certain time frame. And I guess, I don't—\n\nSpeaker 2: Think that I, I don't know if they overlooked it or I'm going to take accountability that—\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't submit it as a replacement. One of the two happened and it makes it then a hold—\n\nSpeaker 2: Until you're able to get it, which would be, you got it at, your original order was at—\n\nSpeaker 1: The end of the month. So at the end of the next month, you'll be able to receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I had to let them know, hey, this is a replacement because he's not supposed to have—\n\nSpeaker 1: It. But pharmaceutical law prohibits you to have a certain amount of pills unless it's—\n\nSpeaker 2: A replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now this time it'll be the correct medication. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right. It'll be the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Summer. Thank you very much. So I should be looking for that. Am I going to get an update—\n\nSpeaker 2: In the, my email?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes, because I submitted it as a new order. So you're going to get an email with—\n\nSpeaker 2: The tracking number, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Bye.",
