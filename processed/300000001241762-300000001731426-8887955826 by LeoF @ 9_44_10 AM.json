I was—\n\nSpeaker 1: Sent to you guys by a score blue and they said that you could help me out with my—\n\nSpeaker 2: Refill tester dream.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can help you out with that. That's no problem. What was your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Simone, S-I-M-O-N-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 80134.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You.\n\nSpeaker 1: You.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, baby, I think for just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: You.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, and the first name was?\n\nSpeaker 1: Robert, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Robert. I have you out. What is that? 18010 April's Way?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Parker, Colorado.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, all right, and the number you called from, that's the best time to reach you at the 303-668?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I have your email as your last name at hotmail.com, yep?\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, I will charge you the same amount for the three bottles you just decided.\n\nSpeaker 1: You.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, it's gonna be 79.85 for the three bottles and I can take your card number whenever you're ready, Mr. Simmons.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you guys don't have it on file?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, so it's a different database, so I have like your address and stuff like that, but not the card information.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: You.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna have to run down to my truck real quick. You can bear with me for like two minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: You.\n\nSpeaker 1: You shouldn't have 75 for three bottles, which is a three-month supply, yep, 79.85 for the three bottles and three months supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: What if we did six models? I just want to double up.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be double the price. So that would be—\n\nSpeaker 2: That will be 149.75.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just do that. That will last me six months and we're not back to do this again for a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, perfect, whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: And multitasking with the gym and trying to catch my Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Ready?\n\nSpeaker 2: For that number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 4985—\n\nSpeaker 1: 0321.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4465.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1225.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: November 27.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 567.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. I'm gonna go ahead and place this order for now. Give me just a moment for the six bottles of the tester dream.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a sec.\n\nSpeaker 1: All—\n\nSpeaker 2: Righty, Robert, your order has been successfully processed. You're going to get a confirmation email.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you'll get a tracking number when it ships as well. You're going to see that order, the merchant name on your bank statement—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to say Superbolize. That's the company I work for, so it's not going to say tester green.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll say Superbolize on your bank statement.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just want to make a little 9975—\n\nSpeaker 1: What? Okay, and then when I have to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Superb—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, there's a life that's Superb Life.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and you'll see on your bank statement.\n\nSpeaker 1: This order will come out in the next few days with USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: You get a tracking number and then whenever you need some more, just give us a shout back.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your guy's number direct?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's 800—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, 780-3968.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, all right, thanks, I'm all set. Thank you.",
