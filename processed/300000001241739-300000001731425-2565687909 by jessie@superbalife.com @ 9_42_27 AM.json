    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Robin. R-O-B-I-N. Hollard. P-O-L-L-A-R-D.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Perfect. Are you at 477 River Road in Ranburn, Alabama?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. And then let's see here. You need to change your order. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I just need to cancel that last. I think I've received two orders, and I think one has shipped, and then I want to cancel that last one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gotcha. So the last one, which has already shipped, I can't cancel it because it's already gone out, but do you want me to cancel your monthly so you don't get it every month?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, now, I looked online this morning, and now it shows three orders have shipped, and I've received two, but it was a total of four orders total. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's only three orders, not four. So one was charged back in December, one for January, one for February. And the last one that was February, that one has shipped. It looks like it's due to arrive on Saturday tomorrow, so that's why I can't stop that one. But there's no other charges other than three, only three.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I'd like to cancel anything that's remaining.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, there are no other orders. So basically, if you want to cancel your refills, I'm happy to do that so you don't get anything on a monthly basis. If you'd like, we can switch it to as needed, so you can just order whenever you feel like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's good. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's do that. You will not get random stuff in the mail anymore, okay? If you want to place an order, then just call in, so we can always make sure that your account is maintained as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's great. Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: And one last thing, full disclosure, if you do not order anything after six months, the system does send you one refill just to keep your prescription active. But other than that, you get nothing else, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute now. No, I don't, if I don't order anything in six months, no, I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, if you want to extend it, you certainly can, but otherwise, you know, that keeps your prescription active. So for example, let's say August rolls around, which is six months from now. August is like a long time from now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're like, I don't want anything else. I'm not ready. Just let us know, and we'll kick the can down the line for you. That maintains your prescription as active without you getting charged for anything else.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I'm in some area where I've got some background noise. I can't quite understand you, and I'm a little hearing impaired. I can't really talk slow and say that again. What about in six months now? Tell me again about that, because I keep understanding two different things.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So let's say hypothetically, you know, August rolls around. Okay. You have until August 30th, end of August, and you're like, I'm not ready for more pills. I just don't want it. I'm not ready right now. Then give us a call and say, hey, I need more time. Just kick the can down the line again for me. We're really easy, but, you know, and then we'll just push it down again for you. But it keeps your prescription active. So when you're ready to order, you can. Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: But it won't automatically send me anything in six months. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: It won't if you call us. That's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. I see. I'm not understanding that. It will or it won't if I call or don't call. Say that again slow. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay. So if you call, we'll kick the can down the line for you, and you don't get charged. If you don't call, the assumption is you want the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want that. I want that canceled where I don't have to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Then we'll have to cancel your prescription altogether, and then when you're ready to order, we won't have a prescription available for you. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do that, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You won't be able to re-up the prescription, just so you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thanks a lot. Have a good day. Bye-bye.",
