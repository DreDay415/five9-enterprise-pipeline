    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. I have square blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I've seen your advertising about the AGV code.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yes, sir. I'm here. Okay. You said you got a I can get a free sample. I want your website.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we don't have any free samples right now. Um,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you're probably referring to the free as in we cover the doctor's fee,\n\nSpeaker 2: uh, which is free, but you still have to pay for the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And how much are the pills? Yeah. So the AGV comes in three different quantities.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can do 10 pills for 49, 25 pills for 99 and 40 pills for 149.\n\nSpeaker 1: You think you get something and it'll not work.\n\nSpeaker 2: There is 100% satisfaction guarantee. So if you're not completely satisfied,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can always give us a call back and we can walk you through the return process for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I think I've used you guys before. Is there any way to look on my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Yeah. Can I get your date of birth, please? 62364.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I do see you had an active prescription with us about,\n\nSpeaker 1: so there's May of 2024 back in the day. So, uh, it would be fairly simple to place an order for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Let's go ahead. I'd get more. I want to make sure it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Uh, and are you still at 1394 Overland drive? No, I've since moved. Okay. Could I have\n\nSpeaker 2: the new address please? It's 1120 North shore drive. Um, let me make sure I'm getting the\n\nSpeaker 1: right address. Okay. It's 1120 North shore drive Northeast. I put any unit 802 and that's\n\nSpeaker 2: St. Pete, St. Petersburg, Florida 3, 3, 7 0 1. If you want to read it back to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So I have 1120 North shore drive Northeast unit 802, St. Petersburg, Florida. Uh, and could\n\nSpeaker 2: you just repeat the zip code for me? Yes. 3, 3, 7 0 1. All right. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it North shore is one word, correct? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So we want to do 10 100 milligram Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's supposed to be better than your last stuff. Cause your last stuff doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. Yeah. The new AGV is from, from, well, the last prescription that you received service,\n\nSpeaker 1: the Alice, this will be very different. Yeah. Okay. I hope so. Yeah. Uh, and lastly, uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: do you have a credit card you'd like to use or a debit card? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. I can take that\n\nSpeaker 1: when you're ready. All right. Could be an Amex card. Okay. 3 7 7 2 3 0 8 9 9 4 3 3 0 0 5\n\nSpeaker 2: expiration 0 1 31.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you want four digits. Yep. 4 2 8 3.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll put this through for you now, Kevin. I'm sorry. I'm putting that through for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, uh, how long, how long does that take to arrive? I was going to say two to five business\n\nSpeaker 2: days expedite that. So I could do expedited shipping, but I know this is kind of occurred\n\nSpeaker 1: last time we put this order through, uh, just like last time, uh, a doctor has to approve your\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription, which it is past 11 o'clock today. So it will not be approved today. Uh, it would\n\nSpeaker 1: probably be approved tomorrow, which is Thursday, and then maybe mailed out by the end of day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's a maybe. So even if we did next day shipping,\n\nSpeaker 1: more than likely you wouldn't receive it till maybe Saturday or Sunday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you looking to get it by Saturday? Yeah. Yeah. That is, it's, it's a little tight. Uh,\n\nSpeaker 1: now I can do it for you. I can do next day shipping and put the request and,\n\nSpeaker 2: and kind of do every request I can to try and get it there to you by,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, Friday evening, early Saturday, but I just can't make any promises.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, can you try? Cause it is a new prescription. Yeah, but I'm an older customer. So\n\nSpeaker 1: yeah, I mean, I, like I said, I just, I don't want you to pay for it and then it not get there in\n\nSpeaker 2: time. How much is the extra shipping? So I could think 30, the $38 would probably get to you by\n\nSpeaker 1: Friday night. Yeah. Let's go ahead and do it. Okay. I'm going to try the same card on file.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think, uh, well, my other card, I think they gave me, I think it's different\n\nSpeaker 1: four digits on the back. Yeah, no, that will use the same card there. All right. That went\n\nSpeaker 2: through. So I'm, I'm putting notes in for the pharmacy. So how does that work? You got doctors\n\nSpeaker 1: got to call me or something? No, no. So luckily the thing is you've already had a prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: with us in the past, so it will be substantially expedited. It won't be like a day or two to be\n\nSpeaker 1: approved. Uh, if, you know, if a doctor's online right now, they might just accept it\n\nSpeaker 2: because it has been assigned a doctor already. Uh, and so you should be good to go to be honest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, you know, can you put it in the notes to the doctor that I'm trying to get it by their own\n\nSpeaker 2: price? I already did. Yep. Exactly. Alrighty. Yeah. Well, let's hope this one works better\n\nSpeaker 1: than the CLS and then, uh, beautiful. Great to hear. All right. We're good. Yeah. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, buddy. Yep. Thank you.",
