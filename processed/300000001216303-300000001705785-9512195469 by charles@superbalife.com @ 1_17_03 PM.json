I've got Steven Gerdes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gerdes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gerdes. Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, any particular reason why we're calling to cancel? It looks like you're a part of the VIP status here now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't work for me at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: At all?\n\nSpeaker 2: At all.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when you take them, you take them on an empty stomach and no alcohol, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are with Pfizer, Steven, so it's always disappointing when our stuff isn't taking its grasp on an individual.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're still interested and looking for something to give you that kick that you're looking for,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to sell you anything, but we do have another version of the Viagra AGV that I can send to you as a sample for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if this version kicks in better and does what it's supposed to for you, which it should,\n\nSpeaker 1: give us a call back and we'll talk about your future needs with this pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Solid, okay. Sounds good. I'll set that up for you right now then, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would expect them by maybe Thursday or Friday, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome, but we're going to cancel the original, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, yeah. If they're dead, then no point, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thanks, Charles. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely. Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.",
