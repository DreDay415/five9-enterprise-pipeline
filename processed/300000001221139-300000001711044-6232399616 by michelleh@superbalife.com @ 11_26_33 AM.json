    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm calling regarding an order of score blue that I received.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can help you out, Jose. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 7-19-1963.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess not very good, but I ordered 20 of them last month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they sent me another refill, and that's what I didn't ask for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see. Okay, the doctor put you on automatic refills on a monthly basis,\n\nSpeaker 2: which you did not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it looks like – do you have the pills on you, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do have them right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me what's imprinted on the pill, on the individual?\n\nSpeaker 1: It says RX-9933739.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take one out of the bottle and tell me what's on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill is AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, go ahead and throw those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent you just regular generic Viagras.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out of replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think I received the same ones last time, and they sent me 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just throw them all out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sending you a replacement of everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, they're going to be shipping this out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you get this new bottle –\n\nSpeaker 2: It says side of pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not, I don't know, generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, you can just throw those away.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just put in a replacement order of the correct AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this new bottle, it's going to say AGV on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, on the individual pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now your bottle says APCO, and the pills say AC something.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just go ahead and throw those away.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll give you my extension so you can call me back\n\nSpeaker 1: and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because this feels –\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just toss them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they're no good.\n\nSpeaker 1: And supposedly within 10, 20 minutes they should be ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I drank them, and they're ready until in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're ready until in the morning, and in the morning everybody's asleep, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ah, shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, I'm sending you a total of 40 of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then just make sure – yeah, so people say they feel a kick in 11 to 15 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 2: but on the bottle it will say take one hour prior.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you just want to make sure you take it on an empty stomach\n\nSpeaker 2: or just don't eat a fatty meal before, like a burger or a steak,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that will affect the medication breakdown.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you going to charge me for them?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, because they sent you the incorrect medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, because I already paid for 10, and then –\n\nSpeaker 1: I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I paid for 10, and then I paid for, I think it was 10,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then they sent me this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm sending you an extra 10 for your troubles.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to get 40 of them for your charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I pause your refills for six months until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then my extension is 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but don't order me no more until I call you to order more,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't know if they're going to work or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I order them and they don't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why I pause you for six months, because if I cancel your refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: it will delete your profile,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pharmacy wouldn't be able to send you out the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active\n\nSpeaker 1: and allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you don't need one by July 31st,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can just call us before and pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps you locked in at your price point as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, you'll get them for about five days.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, you'll have way better results with those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because these, I tried them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: They don't seem to work too good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's kind of weird, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
