    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Dale Rye.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got part of my prescription delivered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: It must have been last Friday or Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And I did not get what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered original new Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And all I got is some cheap scintifical or whatever the hell they call that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull your information up, Dale, and see what I can do for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I do have you up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to confirm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you at 47290-2563?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Hey, let me ask you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you order online when you placed your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you order online?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did get the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should have got that Viagra AGV, it sounds like.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you just got the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll go ahead and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out those 20 minutes out to ASAP.\n\nSpeaker 2: And let me tell you the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Slow down a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you're going to take care of it and send me the right stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Now, look at my count.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got 20 of them, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. For 6395.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you got the upgrade to introducing the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And has that been sent?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you got the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to make sure I get the correct one sent to you right now with no charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what about the pill quantity upgrade?\n\nSpeaker 1: There was 10 of them there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Has that been shipped?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why you got 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should have got 20 in your order that you got, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got 20, but there was a deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: At the end of the deal, I said, give me the upgrade for 10 more.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's what you got, 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first order was for 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first order was for 10, and then you got an addition of 10, which is 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't opened the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just opened the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I send them back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Open the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to make sure, because I'm going to send you these out for no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I want to make sure you did get the right one, because the labels have the difference on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So open the bottle and tell me what's on the back of the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if it's AGB, it should be the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: The label is going to be the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it was AGB, it says the one.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the—\n\nSpeaker 2: I got to go out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go out to my truck.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry for the wait.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had to go outside in my truck, so I'll be with you in just a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the outside of the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's, the outside of the bottle, it's going to be the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can tell you that right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The outside of the bottle is not the issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the actual pills that I'm looking at on my screen of what you received.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because when I ship you out the new, correct one, it's going to be the same thing on the outside of the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can see.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me about two minutes here to get in the house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it is still below zero here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where are you folks from?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're in Los Angeles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, well, hell, it's warm there then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, it's been kind of overcast for the last week and a half, but it's not as bad as it is a lot of places.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I'm from South Dakota, so—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I saw that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at that on your address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's been below zero for the last almost a week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that sounds like my freezer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, what is the number that's supposed to be on the back of it?\n\nSpeaker 1: One, zero, zero.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yours is not going to, yours, I can see right now, you ordered online, didn't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's why I can see with a mix up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three, four, zero is the number on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it should be a one, zero, zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to get those sent out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And basically, yeah, when you look at, when you get to the bottom, it's going to be the same label, but open up the bottom, you're going to see the number one, zero, zero on the actual P.O.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to let you know that it's the new AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's one, zero, what, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: One hundred.\n\nSpeaker 1: The number one hundred.\n\nSpeaker 2: One, zero, zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: One hundred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to be the actual number on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: It won't say A, B, G on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to say AGB, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm telling you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why the mix up sometimes happens at the pharmacy, but I do can see with the actual P.O. that was sent to you was not that AGB, but I'm going to make sure you get that one sent out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, give it about seven to 10 business days, hopefully to get there sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully the weather won't hold it up, but it is definitely on the way effective today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get that taken care of for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got one other question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, so I was charged $63.95 for the first 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that was correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: For the first 10, you got additional, you got $29.40 for the second 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, thank you for helping me out with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be looking forward to getting that other shipment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long does that take?\n\nSpeaker 1: It usually takes about seven to 10 business days, hopefully to get there sooner and hopefully the weather won't affect it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I know the—\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm not worried about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's getting better.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what is your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Jimmy?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: J-I-M-M-Y.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your help on your way with this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: You try to stay one day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm used to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
