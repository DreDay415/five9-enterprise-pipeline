    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. My name is Todd Jadwin and I just received my prescription and I'm not sure it's what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Todd Jadwin in Hudson, Wisconsin?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It looks like you ordered the 50 milligram AJV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you take out one of the pills and read to me what the pill says?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Because when I ordered them, they said the pills were going to be blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: These are white.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. Yeah. The AJVs are not blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are the branded Viagra. Those are $100 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AJVs are a white diamond pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It looks like it says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is the American-made AJV from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great pill. You haven't tried any of them yet, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. I just got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just got it? Okay. I guarantee you, Todd, you and your woman are going to love this pill so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So try it out and then call us and let us know how you like it and we'll talk about your future accommodations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then also, too, because it just says – I can't even pronounce it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stendylapil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stendylapil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stendylapil. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's an active ingredient in all Viagra, so that's why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Yeah. Because it doesn't say nothing about the AJV and I was just kind of curious.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Right. So AJV stands for authorized generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a completely different formula than any generic Viagra, so it might not look like much, Todd,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's a hell of a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I guarantee you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Next question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So, you know, I am kind of a – I'm very factual.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's no gray area.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So like when all the advertising I've seen for this and it says it works for like, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: 11 to 15 minutes, but then now the paperwork says take it 30 minutes before.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says an hour.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 30 to an hour.\n\nSpeaker 2: 30 to an hour, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't get me wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think pharmacies need to put that on the pill bottles legally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the pills themselves, yes, they should activate within about 15 to 20 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 1: but everybody is billed differently, Todd.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tell them all the time, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Me and you are obviously billed differently, so your body is going to react differently to how my body would react to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So give it time, but it should activate within about the first 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So on the safe side, if I – okay, so obviously I'm going to be, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: monitoring this very carefully and closely myself.\n\nSpeaker 2: So in a perfect world, should I just plan on giving myself a half hour to an hour?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would that be better?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then make sure that it's like on an empty stomach as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: That works best if you're empty, no major steaks or hell, mac and cheese, any of that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will prevent it from moving freely throughout your body, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate your time, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
