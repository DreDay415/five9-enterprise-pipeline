    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm well. How are you doing today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. So I had an order last month and I already received it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then this week I found that my card got recharged again for $115.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't order any refills or I didn't even apply for auto refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So can we please fix this and get a refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: If I can further assist you, if I can have your name and your date of birth\n\nSpeaker 1: so I can pull your account up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. My name is Hany and my date of birth is 11-27-67.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Hany, it looks like the prescription that you currently have that Dr. Tariq wrote,\n\nSpeaker 1: it does come with refills for every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does say on your bottle, it will say how many refills you have left.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why you were charged for another refill and you actually have one on the way to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want to cancel it. I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will do refills when I need it, not just an auto refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how our programs work is that the prescription does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not obligated to get it every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it is something that you know that you're going to want to continue to get down the line,\n\nSpeaker 1: what we could do is adjust it to every six months so that way your prescription is active.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you adjust it to get the refill when it's ordered, not every two months, not every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to manage an account like this.\n\nSpeaker 2: So whenever I need it, I'm going to just set an order. It's simple.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I understand that, but I'm trying to explain to you that's not how our program works.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to cancel your refills, I can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just know that you won't be able to – you'll be put on a wait list to reorder\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'll have to pay for the doctor's prescription the next time around.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'll go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how long does it take for a refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the order was shipped to you, so if you don't want that order,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm showing it's going to be delivered on Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can refuse it, and then once it's received, your card on file will be refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to be traveling, and there is a storm here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't believe this is happening now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even if it's every two months, is that two months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Two months has already passed?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you got it in November.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now when I get this shipment, are you sure it already got shipped?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I have a tracking number on it, and it shows that it was going to be delivered on Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's currently in Jersey City.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what are the steps in order to ship it back?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you collect it, just from your mailbox, don't open it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Write refuse, return to sender, and just put it back in your mailbox for the mailman to collect.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, say that again, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to not open the thing, but that's obvious.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Write refuse, return to sender, and put it back in the mailbox for the mailman to collect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and usually how long does it take?\n\nSpeaker 1: It usually takes about a week for it to go back, or a few days for it to go back to the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: And once they receive it, it takes like three days for it to process, the refund to process.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Have a good day.",
