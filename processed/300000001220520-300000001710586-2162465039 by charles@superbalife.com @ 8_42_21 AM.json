How about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I got two charges that shouldn't be on my thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I only ordered one thing, and I got three charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of them is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Anthony Welch.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. You're in Cleveland, Ohio?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like we filed the refund orders for all three charges yesterday and deactivated the account as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: We refunded everything yesterday, so it'll take a couple of days to hit your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, y'all was only supposed to refund two things, not three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it looks like we received disputes for everything, so we just refunded everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do I do?\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to talk to your bank, because at this point, we've already deactivated your account because of the dispute,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you're no longer allowed to order with us anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good job. But do you see where y'all order one thing, and y'all charge for three things, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Next time, you got to call in and figure that out with us and not talk to your bank,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you make us look really, really bad with the banks when you file a dispute like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So at this point, brother, you're blacklisted from ever ordering from us again.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what do I do if I want to order something? That's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Y'all charge me for three things, and y'all's only supposed to charge me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to go to Bluetooth. You got to go to somewhere else, your doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know, but you can't order with us anymore, unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, then. Hope you have a good one.",
