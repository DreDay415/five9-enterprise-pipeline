    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hey, how you doing today? Good. I'm calling, I want to see about cancelling my order, not order, my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: May I have the phone number you use?\n\nSpeaker 1: I use the one you're calling me from, but I don't see no account. Maybe use a different number?\n\nSpeaker 2: The other one was turned off, 251-545-0375.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. William Yeo?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I see you have a prescription, I think, for 100mg, 10 tablets, Viagra. Any health concerns, or you just want to order as needed? You don't want to be on a monthly?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, order as needed. Actually, I'm not getting what they say I was getting anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you were trying to get, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's supposed to be the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not the AGV? Do you have a pill in front of you, by any chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir, I don't. It's at home.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, take me off of that each month, where I can order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, as needed. I'm going to pause the prescription to lock your price, because I see you have a pretty good price right now, but that way you're not going to be on a monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can order as needed. If you take two refills a year, if you get two refills a year, that's the little caveat right there.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're always going to keep you at the same price, but I'm going to pause you for half a year, so you're not on a monthly. You can go to reorder, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I'll call to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know if my order that just came out on the 9th has shipped?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's already delivered, but I'm going to tell you the date in a second. Give me one moment. I'm going to tell you the date in a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a tracking number already. Let me tell you. They delivered yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. My wife, she probably already picked them up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, she delivered yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll pause you for half a year, so you're not on a monthly, and that way I can keep you at this deal that you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get it, if you want, once every six months or sooner than that if you like, but you're not on a monthly anymore, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, man. Sure appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Bye-bye. You have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, same to you. Thank you.",
