    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, hi. I replaced an order a few weeks ago for the supposedly new AGV or whatever, Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: To you guys, and I sent an email in. I couldn't be more disappointed. The product is incredibly weak. This is supposed to be the real stuff, the new stuff. It's terrible. It takes forever to activate. It's very weak. I just want to make sure that I have no additional orders,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm not going to be charged any further because I ordered 10, and then I got a discounted price to order an additional 10. I got 20 of them, and I was billed like $67 for the\n\nSpeaker 2: supposedly new AGV, and they're not the new AGV. They're the basic generic Viagra, and\n\nSpeaker 1: they are worse than the ones that I get for $0.97 from Friday Plans. The whole marketing\n\nSpeaker 2: thing says that you guys are way better than Friday Plans, and the pills are a total joke.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to make sure that I'm not getting charged again, and I want to file a formal complaint,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to leave a Google review reflecting my experience.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Mr. Webster?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see. Do you have the pill, the actual pill with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I have the what with me?\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill, the bottle, so you can grab a single pill. I'm just curious to see the code on\n\nSpeaker 2: the pill that you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: I might have one with me. I'm not sure. I have a half of one, but it just says on the\n\nSpeaker 2: order it says generic Viagra. It was supposed to be. I understand. The pill, it says I can't\n\nSpeaker 1: read all of it because I don't have all of it, but it says. I don't know. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just says I can't read all of it again because I don't have the whole thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's probably AC340 or AC399. The AGV should say 50 if you get the AGV on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why did I not get the AGV? The whole video I watched, the whole ad that I watched was\n\nSpeaker 1: all about the AGV, and it said you're ordering the new, get bigger, get a lot stronger, fat\n\nSpeaker 2: works faster, all AGV, AGV, AGV, AGV. Everything in the ad said AGV. It said order new AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: order 10 for $5 a piece, and then I could order. So I ordered that, and then it gave\n\nSpeaker 2: me the option to order an additional 10 for half price. So I was supposed to be charged\n\nSpeaker 1: 50. You guys ended up charging me 65 for the first 10, which was supposed to be $5\n\nSpeaker 2: a piece, but you charged me 65. Then you charged me an additional 25, so I paid $90 for 20\n\nSpeaker 1: pills, and what you sent me. Mr. Webster. Yeah. Yeah, I heard your concern. Let's move\n\nSpeaker 2: forward so I can help you and resolve your issue, okay? So I don't know why. From what\n\nSpeaker 1: I can see, the order was populated, but it could be because it was a lot of order at\n\nSpeaker 2: the same time when you placed yours. I'm not sure, but the pharmacy fulfilled the spec\n\nSpeaker 1: that they received, which was regular Sidenafil. So what I'm going to do to fix the issue,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a replacement with the AGV, okay? So the AGV is going to say on\n\nSpeaker 1: the pill 5-0. It's not going to say AC, because AC, that's regular generic for many\n\nSpeaker 2: pharmacies. We're the only one with the AGV, so it's going to say 5-0, right? It's a different\n\nSpeaker 1: formula. The only thing they didn't do, they didn't put the blue dye, because if they put\n\nSpeaker 2: the blue dye pill, it's going to be $90. Nobody want to pay that. Pfizer realized they need\n\nSpeaker 1: to reach a bigger audience, and Viagra don't have to be a secret medicine since back in\n\nSpeaker 2: the day, so everybody can get to it. So now... Right, because I can already get the regular\n\nSpeaker 1: Sidenafil for 97 cents a pill, and it works 10 times better than what I got from you guys\n\nSpeaker 2: that I paid $5 a pill for. Okay. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to send you a replacement,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then as far as the price goes, I'm going to break down what happened for your price.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the 10 pills is $49, right? There is no tax, shipping is covered, but there is a pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: processing fee of $14.95. That's the part that you pay as a patient. It used to be $9.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: things increased, I think it went up to $14.95. That's where it gets you to $63.95. Now, they\n\nSpeaker 1: give you a half off deal for an extra 10 pills, which is $29.40. So you don't pay the full\n\nSpeaker 2: price, you pay $30, we'll get the next time, like double the quantity basically, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you a replacement, you don't need to send those, you can keep them\n\nSpeaker 2: as a backup or whatever. They're FDA approved from Pfizer, and I'm going to send you a 20\n\nSpeaker 1: pill of the AGV. I hope that works better for you, because here, a little bit of a background\n\nSpeaker 2: with taking all the meds, right? When you take all of those companies, including the\n\nSpeaker 1: name that you mentioned, Friday and all that, the thing is, when I work over there, it might\n\nSpeaker 2: be cheap, but the problem is they have fillers, and those fillers mess up your system, and\n\nSpeaker 1: when you get the regular, the real med, because it's pure med from the company you created,\n\nSpeaker 2: you feel like, oh, that's not working, because you get attached to the fillers they put in\n\nSpeaker 1: the other medication. So now, your system has it, so it's biochemistry, so the system\n\nSpeaker 2: is used to the way the other med activates you. Now, when you get the regular stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: the authentic stuff, it don't work, it's like a dish, right? When you get those dishes,\n\nSpeaker 2: like TV dinner, whatever, they do some additives, so it tastes so good, you get used to it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and when somebody do from scratch the same dish, sometimes you don't like it, because\n\nSpeaker 2: you're used to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's why I used to have a prescription for the real Viagra from Pfizer, the real\n\nSpeaker 2: blue stuff, I had it, and it worked exactly the same as the ones I got from Friday Plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only one that I've ever used that didn't work were the ones I got from you guys, so\n\nSpeaker 2: let's hope this new one works better, we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why is that, it's kind of strange, but I mean, if you say, I take\n\nSpeaker 2: your word for sure, and I'm just going to send you a replacement for 20, okay, you're\n\nSpeaker 1: not going to be charged with a replacement, okay, and then you can call back and maybe\n\nSpeaker 2: reorder or stuff of that nature, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much, I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so let me put that down here for you, 50 milligrams, all right, I'm placing the\n\nSpeaker 1: order, I hope we can get you going with a better erection with that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's hope so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you pay for 20, I'm shipping you 25 of the AGV, okay, so you can keep the one\n\nSpeaker 1: you have, and you're going to have five extra AGV from what you pay, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you're now on the lowest part.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you may not, obviously, when you put down, what was that, did you put it under him or\n\nSpeaker 1: me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, meds are really strange, because I had a patient who called saying that, oh, I did\n\nSpeaker 1: the Friday pain, it didn't work, I like yours better, and then, you know, different feedback\n\nSpeaker 2: with you, it's kind of sometimes pretty tricky, those things, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I get it, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why, I don't know why, but yeah, I'm not sure why, but I heard patients saying\n\nSpeaker 1: the opposite things that you're saying, so it's kind of...\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll give this a try and we'll see what happens from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I really hope that can be a better help.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, I sent you 25 of the AGV, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: The bill's going to pay 5,000, with a different medical code on it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're all set for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one, yeah, yeah, you have a good weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
