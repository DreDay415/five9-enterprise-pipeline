    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagras, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was calling about a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to see how much it costs to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, Jeffrey, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: March 21st, 1962.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it looks like, let me see, it's NFL.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I had the 20 milligrams last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the higher the milligrams, the more it costs, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the milligrams are all the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: So right now, let's see, I need my calculator.\n\nSpeaker 2: You get a quantity of 12.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get a quantity of 12 for $38.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can just get 12, that's all?\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes in 12, 18, 24, or 30.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is 30?\n\nSpeaker 1: 30 is going to be $74.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, goodness.\n\nSpeaker 1: What about the 24?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: $62.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the cheapest one is the one for 12.\n\nSpeaker 1: What about 18?\n\nSpeaker 2: $50.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: $50.95?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Y'all are going to be on tomorrow, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because I'm going to call back and order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because I'm going to call back and order.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the milligrams are still the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't matter what milligram you get.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it's supposed to be more potent.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is a milligram more effective?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I just told you the same one you were getting, the 20 milligram generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: It only comes in 20 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're talking about the new AGB Viagra, you can get a quantity of 10 for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're more potent?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodness.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 100 milligrams a piece?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they come in 25, 50, and 100, but I would say get the 100s.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can break them in half if you need to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because how many pills of the Sidenafil do you have to take?\n\nSpeaker 1: You just take one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just one.\n\nSpeaker 1: But how much did you say the 100 milligrams is now?\n\nSpeaker 2: For the new AGB, the Pfizer's latest formula of Viagra, you get a quantity of 10, 100 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 1: for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that ain't bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That ain't bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can break them in half, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you say I can get 10 for $60?\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the most you can get, a 10?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we have a quantity of 25 for $113.95 and a quantity of 40 for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get that 60.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to call back tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you put me on the call?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to call right back tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name's Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to be there tomorrow, Michelle?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll be here.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, oh, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, you're moving too fast.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm calling back to get that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your extension is?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's for Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when I call, what I need to do, just say extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so when you call in, just hit the four digits, 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and if not, just ask for Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll transfer you to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I come out better than the 10 and break them up.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be a lot better than the 20 milligrams, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And honestly, if you're taking 20 milligrams, if you get a pill cutter, you could probably\n\nSpeaker 1: break them in, you know, thirds.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I'm going to cut them up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said it's going to be 63 what?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I tell you what, hold on, I want to hold on for a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I'm going to order them now because I can put that, I can put that money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got to go get my wallet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can go ahead and put, yeah, you can go ahead and put them in order now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go get my wallet so I can give you my, um.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you still at 1035 Country Lane Court?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am, 1035 Country Lane Court.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the only thing with the AGV that will put you on automatic refills, but what we\n\nSpeaker 1: can do, we can go ahead and pause you for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just pause you until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's in such high demand, yeah, that I'll just pause you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way you can just call in when you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I forgot to get my key.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get my key.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that just came up, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: A new one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's new.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It must be popular.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, oh, I know I will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go, let me get my key so I can get my, um, wallet out.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have enough on my other card.\n\nSpeaker 2: See, I get paid tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was going to order it tomorrow, but.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to just call me back tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You think I should get it tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because, I mean, they're not going to ship it out today.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's too late.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I mean, I might as well just call me tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm here, Florida is, you're three hours ahead, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're, you're Eastern time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm here eight to three.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm here 11 to five, your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 11.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you want me to call you back about 11, 11 after 11?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: My time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, yeah, yeah, your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because we open at eight.\n\nSpeaker 2: My time.\n\nSpeaker 1: My time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call you my time at 11.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll call you back tomorrow, Ms. Michelle, and we'll get that taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to get them.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Talk to you in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Get your book.",
