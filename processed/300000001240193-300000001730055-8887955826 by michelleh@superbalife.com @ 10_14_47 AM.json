    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Rich Schneiderite. I have a prescription for you guys. I just contacted\n\nSpeaker 1: the other place and they told me how to call you. I'm trying to cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Can I have your phone number so I can fill up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. 732-715-0931.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Richard. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: August 26, 62.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. Is he your VIP status customer? And how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not that good. That's why I'm canceling it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm asking. It looks like the pharmacy made an error and you just received\n\nSpeaker 1: generic Viagra. You did not receive the AGV. Do you happen to have them on you by any chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Give me a second. I'm going to get you out a replacement and then I'm going to tell you how\n\nSpeaker 2: you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need a replacement. I just want to cancel it totally.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. No problem. I went ahead and closed out your account. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
