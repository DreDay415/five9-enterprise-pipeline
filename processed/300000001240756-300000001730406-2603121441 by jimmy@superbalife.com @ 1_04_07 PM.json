I'm just trying to cancel my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if possible, I tried to do it through e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think there's an order in progress.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it still able to be canceled at the pharmacy and possibly get a refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that it was shipped out basically on the 11th yesterday,\n\nSpeaker 1: but all you have to do is just reject that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just have it returned to sender, and we'll get you credited back for that order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I see that you're getting the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're getting 30 of them, 20 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any particular reason why you want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't mind me asking?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just not too expensive.\n\nSpeaker 2: Too expensive? Okay, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can go ahead and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just curious, have you thought about trying our latest and greatest new AGB Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you heard about that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a lot cheaper and it works a lot better.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I was asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll go ahead and take care of your request for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you say return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 2: how do I do return to sender when it finally does come within a couple days?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, basically the address is on the package,\n\nSpeaker 2: but what I will recommend is that you actually take it to the post office\n\nSpeaker 1: and you get a tracking number so you know exactly when it comes back.\n\nSpeaker 2: And once we receive it, we will credit you the difference on your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I went ahead and stopped all your future orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: As far as that's concerned, your subscription has been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.",
