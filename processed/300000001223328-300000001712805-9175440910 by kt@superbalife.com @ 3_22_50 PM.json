    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Louis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hey, but thanks for holding. So I did three things for you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as a veteran, I got my fingerprints on this and I always take pride and honor in my work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the first thing I did is I put a stop—\n\nSpeaker 1: To any and all monthly shipments, and I overrode the system and I sent a message, an email on your behalf to Dr.\n\nSpeaker 2: Green, and I told him we're putting a stop to all this monthly—\n\nSpeaker 1: Refills, and I surely put a stop to any and all monthly—\n\nSpeaker 2: Charges, and I paused your prescription and I credited your account the $63.95 for this order that tried to go out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I set you up as an elite status so you can just get it on your own, and the way to do that—\n\nSpeaker 2: But is when you go to scoreblue.com—\n\nSpeaker 1: Login with their AOL account, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, and—\n\nSpeaker 1: When you go in and you log in, you're going to click the three little lines in your top right of the screen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you're going to go to this category called Your Prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you go to that category, you're going to see a red button with white font that says Quick Refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now anytime, anywhere as an elite—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can click that button. You can even go from the Bronx down to Miami.\n\nSpeaker 2: Put down in the shipping address where you want, where you are at the hotel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Click the button, it will send it to your hotel.\n\nSpeaker 2: All you have to do then is tip the butler, have him send up the Puerto Ricans and the Brazilians, and then you could do—\n\nSpeaker 1: A ménage à trois or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, but, but, uh, so take down my extension too, but so if you need anything at all, you need something stronger—\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, and something to make you like King Kong or something like that. Let me know, but I got something for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Zero zero three seven.\n\nSpeaker 1: Zero zero three seven. Yeah, and thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're very welcome, blues, and just keep in mind in New York, the state in New York—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can't get more than one refill within a 30-day period. You have to wait till like 31 or 32 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, to click that button twice, and then you can't get more than two refills a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, just call me if you need something stronger and all that, and if there's any consolation to you—\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you can, as a veteran, if you just open up your AOL account, your Gmail, and just put in the address support—\n\nSpeaker 1: At scoreblue.com and just write something about me, but I'm up for review and I could use any merit, any dollar, but—\n\nSpeaker 2: Support at scoreblue.com and just write something organic, man. Tell the truth, but you got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, no, that would really help. You know, we're Americans.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we have to look out for each other now. Everyone's just fucking stabbing each other's back and everything, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: We got to look out for each other, you know, and you're from the Bronx, dude.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you guys are old school, you know, since Rocksteady Crew, since Run DMC, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, this is old school. You guys made Luther Vandross and all that stuff. You guys made that guy.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I mean, right, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but so just support at scoreblue.com. Let him know KT.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, he's a good one or whatever it is, but please on your heart.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, bud, and keep it rocking, bro, and rolling. Alright, I'm here for you. You got it. Take care, bud. Alright. Adios.",
