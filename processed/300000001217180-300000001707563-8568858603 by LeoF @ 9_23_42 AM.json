I'm calling because I don't want to be on that automatic refill program.\n\nSpeaker 1: I never signed up for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll spell it. D-I-P-P-O-L-I-T-O.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 08094.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bruce?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I can stop that for you, Bruce. Not a problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Looks like you got set up on our VIP prescription there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I wanted to offer you, before I did cancel,\n\nSpeaker 1: let you know I can pause these refills as far as six months in advance.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can always call us in between if you did want to get a refill order or anything like that,\n\nSpeaker 1: or online you can do that as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to offer you that before I did cancel it outright.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are the only FDA-approved company with the medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I do cancel, I wouldn't be able to open it back up for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just wanted to make sure you were aware before I stopped that for you completely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, so I would be put on pause for six months and then automatically be put back on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not automatically, but if we didn't hear from you, yeah, it would start back up.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you called us, like, any time before as well, you don't have to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just say, hey, you know, I need a little more time, or I'm traveling, or I just don't need them now,\n\nSpeaker 2: or I need them sooner, and it's all, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: One more time? Sorry, I didn't hear you there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no worries. I'm going to cancel that for you, Bruce.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, we won't be able to sell you anymore in the future,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we are the only company with those pills from Pfizer, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll be back in about a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll probably be back in about a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Bruce.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
