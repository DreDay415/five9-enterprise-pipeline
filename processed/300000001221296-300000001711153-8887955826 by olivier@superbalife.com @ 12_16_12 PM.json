    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, how are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to know, where do I go by to cancel an order?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was automatic refill, evidently, that they sent me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me have the phone that you used for your prescription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: The number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Phone number, phone number that you used.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, 202-308-7354.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Whitefield?\n\nSpeaker 2: Whitfield, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whitfield.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: In D.C.?\n\nSpeaker 2: Washington, D.C.?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I see is you have a prescription for 100 milligrams, 10 tablets,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I think because you got 10 tablets, there was 30 days in the month,\n\nSpeaker 2: assuming you asked if they got you on a refill, but if you don't need it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to advise the pharmacy to stop the initial writing,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: They pause the prescription up to half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't get it on the monthly anymore, and you can just reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that allows you to lock your pricing and keep your doctor prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: available to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what if I just want to cancel it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's up to you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's up to you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're sure that you will not need Viagra, but you have, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 2: they want me to let you know that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: you have the option to pause when you don't need to receive refill\n\nSpeaker 2: or get bill every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not obligated to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just the initial writing, assuming that you need Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you don't need it as often, everything is paused,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you reorder as needed, and you don't pay market price when you reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: You keep the same price you have today, and then, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you reorder in a few months or whatever when you need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they don't require you to get you every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: We want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Another question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: They automatically sent me one.\n\nSpeaker 2: What if I want to send the one they sent?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send it back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, you can send it back, and then we're going to refund you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll cancel your prescription, cancel your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Be aware that, you know, you might not be able to reorder,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if the order goes through, you will have a different price,\n\nSpeaker 1: because they're going to have to get you a new doctor consultation,\n\nSpeaker 2: which costs money to the company,\n\nSpeaker 1: because we didn't preserve and save the one they financed for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's what I was trying to do, so you could get Viagra in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you want to return it, you can just return it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we're going to refund you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I already got the paper to resend it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I got to get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you just write refuse return on the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: Refuse return on the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all you got to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And take it to the mailbox and send it back, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can't even leave it in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: When the mailman see that, he's going to understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's got to send that back to the source.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long is it going to take to get his refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: As soon as we get the package back, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, does he need to send it certified or just put refuse on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I already explained to you the process, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they just send it back with the package and just say refuse.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did he sign up for automatic refills before y'all sent that package?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: So basically, the doctor wrote the prescription because he ordered 10 with\n\nSpeaker 1: refills, but when you don't need refills, when you call us,\n\nSpeaker 2: we advise the pharmacy that you're not really an active patient like that,\n\nSpeaker 1: so we stop the initial writing from the doctor and you order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was offering,\n\nSpeaker 1: which allow you to save and order at the same price in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're just preserving the doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 1: The account is paused, so you just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: But he said that he don't want to keep his prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: The whole account is canceled,\n\nSpeaker 1: so he might not be able to reorder in the future,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if he does reorder, price will be different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
