My name is Scott Foster and I'm just trying to get my subscription with you guys canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 59718.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Law Road in Bozeman?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can cancel this out for you, sir, but if I do so, it will close out the prescription entirely, which may make it more difficult for you to order if you needed to down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which, before, I'd just make it less frequent for you rather than every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, let's go ahead and close it out, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I've closed out the prescription. Your account is closed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
