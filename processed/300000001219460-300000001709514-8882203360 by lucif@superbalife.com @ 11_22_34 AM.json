I do understand you said you had some side—\n\nSpeaker 2: Effects here. Obviously, we can't cancel this for you, but we do have another viagra that—\n\nSpeaker 1: Has been made over the last 10 years here to get rid of most of those adverse side effects—\n\nSpeaker 2: Like headaches, runny nose, flustered feeling. Yeah, what I'm having is, I'm having feelings—\n\nSpeaker 1: Of sort of like increased anxiety and almost like I've been drinking coffee all day. And—\n\nSpeaker 2: I have high blood pressure, so I'm going to back out of everything for right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I totally understand. Your health is important. You do know this was prescribed—\n\nSpeaker 2: By a doctor, though, correct? I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. They had to check out your medical history. I just wanted to make sure you did know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, because we do make sure this is safe before we send it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I noted that I had high blood pressure, but I'm still getting these side—\n\nSpeaker 2: Effects and I'm not comfortable with them. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, we'll take care of it for you, sir. And this is not something that you want to wait and hold because we can always—\n\nSpeaker 2: Just not bill or send it to you for, I mean, even up to like a half a year and give you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Some time to figure things out.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no. No, I want to close it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to close it out now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. We'll do that for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything else you need?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. Will I get a confirmation in my email?\n\nSpeaker 1: No email confirmation, no. Just a verbal one that everything is canceled here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I shouldn't, basically I should not receive a bottle next month, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: You will never receive this again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good day.",
