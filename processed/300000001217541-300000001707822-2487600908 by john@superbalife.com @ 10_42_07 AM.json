    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling, this is John, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Martin Henchman and I ordered score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got to want to know when it's coming, one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And two, I think I ordered more and I can't see a receipt for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And three, I think I made the wrong email address out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can help you with all that. I just need your zip code, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: 48038.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got you pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So regarding the shipping, you will be approved probably today\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we'll ship it out within a day or two.\n\nSpeaker 2: We usually get it about a week after you ordered it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you ordered it, it looks like, yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you probably will get it approximately next Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Our pharmacy is also in this storm zone, though, sort of like you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it may be delayed with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But typically, five to seven days after you order it, you receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Regarding your email, what should it be, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, my email.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's marty.henchman at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I left the dot out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so you didn't leave the dot out, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: The way Google reads those emails, they actually read them the same,\n\nSpeaker 2: whether or not it has a period in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: So to not confuse our system, we automatically remove them.\n\nSpeaker 2: It still functions the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get emails all the same like you would, but it just doesn't display the period.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I checked it myself and it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent an email to myself.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm using Gmail, which is Google, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you an email explaining it because it does work.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the last question was about the amount you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did order ten pills and then you added ten more.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're getting 20 total pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the total on that was $93.35.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you taken the money yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you were charged when you paid for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes I'm on limited funds.\n\nSpeaker 2: It depends when my checks come in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Isn't that where you get it paid for?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and if for some reason you were not approved, I don't expect that,\n\nSpeaker 2: because most people are not approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very rare.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if it happens, you get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: So either way, you'll either get the pills or you'll get your money.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at everything here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you telling me the doctor still hasn't approved me?\n\nSpeaker 1: When you put in that request to change your e-mail,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's a line to the doctor, not to customer service.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that then slows up the process, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Also, you did that on Sunday, so the doctor isn't even working Sunday.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yes, he's going to approve you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it takes another week, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Where do you ship from?\n\nSpeaker 2: It ships out of Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then it takes how long the U.S. Postal Service takes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, as you know, there's a ton of snow right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: so things are slowing down with that, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we got five inches overnight.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, a lot of parts of the country got more than that, too,\n\nSpeaker 2: including where our pharmacy's at.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they will get this out this week, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
