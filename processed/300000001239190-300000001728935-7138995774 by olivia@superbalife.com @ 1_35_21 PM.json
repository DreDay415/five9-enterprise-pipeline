    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling the IACRA. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Leon Clark.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Leon, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Doing good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good, I'm glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Leon?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've got a prescription from you guys on Tademophil. Yeah. And I oversupplied on it. I need to cancel it for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay Leon, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 06-27-1949.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 8610 Sunny Ridge Drive in Houston, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we have you as Bud. Is that okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay Bud. Leon, shall I say?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you don't want to continue receiving those regular monthly refills, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds good. Let's put it on hold then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, if you need anything before the middle of August of this upcoming year, just give us a call. We're always here Monday through Friday 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much Leon. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too ma'am. Appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.",
