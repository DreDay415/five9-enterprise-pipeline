I got you. I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's a little confusing on that part.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, as long as he just approves it really quickly, then, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if he doesn't, you're going to get it shipped tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll get an email, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you're all set.
