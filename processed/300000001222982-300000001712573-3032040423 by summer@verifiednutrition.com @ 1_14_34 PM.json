What's your name and birthday?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-3-57, Phil Glover.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Looks like you already did it. You don't have an active prescription with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's a few questions that I do have.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I did last time is I did deal of the month and that's what I'm listed at now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will that be the way I respond to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: In other words, until I do another deal of the month, you won't charge my credit card and send anything to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's great. Thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
