    "text": "Speaker 1: Outside my house. Hi, this is Viagra. Hello? Hello, how are we doing, sir? Yeah, this is\n\nSpeaker 2: Score Blue, right? Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I put a, I sent an order in, I think it was Sunday,\n\nSpeaker 1: Saturday or Sunday, I think it was yesterday. Okay. Yeah, and I didn't get nothing there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I looked at my card, it says it was $49. Well, how much was it? Well, look up\n\nSpeaker 1: my order. Yes, Mr. Bruce Duncan in Philadelphia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I see you placed the\n\nSpeaker 2: order and one of our physicians also already wrote your prescription, approved you. You\n\nSpeaker 1: ordered Viagra, 100 milligram, 10 tablets. So what you ordered, as you mentioned, is $49 before\n\nSpeaker 2: checkout, but at checkout, there was a pharmacy processing fee used to be $9.95. I think now\n\nSpeaker 1: it's $14.95. So it comes to $63.95. Okay. But shipping is free, there is no tax. And you\n\nSpeaker 2: receive a tracking, you choose a tracking number when they ship your order through your\n\nSpeaker 1: email. Yeah, I didn't get anything yet. All right. So this is the, this is the real good\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra ones, right? Yeah, they're the high quality Viagra ones. Okay. Yeah. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Send me a, when you get a chance, just send me a tracking number. I didn't get that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says it's going to take a little bit because of the weather. Yes. No, it's not out yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure what's going on. I know on your side over there, it's a... We just got hit\n\nSpeaker 2: with a major snowstorm, bro. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. There was snow even in DC this weekend. They\n\nSpeaker 1: were preparing the road and everything's like that. So, um, yeah, we just got hit. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got hit? Oh, okay. Yeah. Last night and yesterday. Yeah. We got hit bad. Yeah. That\n\nSpeaker 1: could be, oh, it was bad. Oh. 14 inches. We got 15 inches here. Oh, wow. Wow. Unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 2: I heard Texas got some, some snow too. Oh, really? Yeah. Colorado was snowing a little\n\nSpeaker 1: bit. Oh, for sure. Colorado. That's not a question. Yeah. All right. Um, that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me, uh, yeah, tracking number by email when it's created, when they send it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: the doctor approved you already. That's a good thing. He wrote a prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they haven't sent it out yet. So you got a tracking number. It takes two to five business\n\nSpeaker 1: days. But as you mentioned, if you have those weather inclinations over there,\n\nSpeaker 2: just keep in mind, you know, the USPS, I don't know how they're going to work, but you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: hopefully in the next few days you'll be clear. So you get your order. Now this is just the one\n\nSpeaker 2: time purchase, right? Yeah. So the way it works, you get you for the doctor, for you to access the\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra order. So he wrote the prescription with refills, but when you don't need refills, what\n\nSpeaker 2: you do, as you mentioned it right now, what I'm going to do, I'm going to pause the prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: with the pharmacy because you probably don't need refill often. And then you're going to just\n\nSpeaker 2: reorder as needed basically. Yeah. I'll just reorder if I need it, but I don't want to,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want that way your prescription every month. I don't want that. No, that's fine. That's\n\nSpeaker 2: fine. I just want to start. I'm going to try it the one time I'm going to try it the first time\n\nSpeaker 1: because I never did it before, but my friend had them and he goes, Oh my God, they're amazing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's amazing. So I'll try it and then I'll go from there. If I need more, I'll call and do it\n\nSpeaker 1: all over again. Yeah. They're going to pause the prescription because the prescription is pretty\n\nSpeaker 2: expensive to get written by the doctor. So you don't want to lose that. Otherwise you're going\n\nSpeaker 1: to get charged more. So what, what I'm going to do, I'm going to advise the pharmacy to pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll pause you, I think up to half a year so you can reorder, but you don't get monthly refill\n\nSpeaker 1: because you don't need it. But if you need in the future refill as often, you can get it every two\n\nSpeaker 2: months, every three months. You can do that as well. You just got to let the company know that,\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you know, I need, I need some background stuff like that, you know? Yeah. Just unsubscribe me for\n\nSpeaker 2: now. And then I'll come back and I'll do it again. Yeah, you will be paused. So the prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: will be preserved and paused so you can reorder. All right. Well, I don't want them charging me\n\nSpeaker 2: every month because I'll have to, then I'll have to block it and all that. You're not going to be\n\nSpeaker 1: charged every month, sir. Everything is paused for half a year. The monthly is not required\n\nSpeaker 2: with your prescription. If you don't need pill, you don't need pill. You can get it once or twice\n\nSpeaker 1: a year. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's it. That's going to last me a while because I really\n\nSpeaker 2: don't use them that much. I mean, I'm, I'm still good. I still can get up within an hour and\n\nSpeaker 1: rest and all that. So I'm just checking it out because I got a girl that was, she's killing me.\n\nSpeaker 2: She wants all, all my thing here. That's it. That's it. So I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: going to try it. I'll give, I'll give it a shot. All right. Thank you. And I'll get back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Bye.",
