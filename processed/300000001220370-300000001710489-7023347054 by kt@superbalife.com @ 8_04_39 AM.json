    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Larry, thanks for waiting. Mr. Whalen, KT Guderich again and my extension, if you\n\nSpeaker 2: ever need anything at all, because my fingerprints are on this and as a veteran I take a lot\n\nSpeaker 1: of pride and honor in serving our men and women too, in any case, you know, but my extension\n\nSpeaker 2: is 0037. If you need anything at all, let me know. I'll be your guy. I'm your advocate.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did is I did exactly what you wanted. The first thing I did is I put a stop to any\n\nSpeaker 2: and all monthly shipments. And then the second thing I did is I put a stop to any and all\n\nSpeaker 1: monthly refills. And then I overrode the system. I put a stop to any and all monthly charges\n\nSpeaker 2: and I paused your prescription and I set up a red button for you on the dashboards. When\n\nSpeaker 1: you get a chance, use your phone or a desktop or tablet, log on using your Gmail, Lawrence,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? Just verify that it's Lawrence 70547. There's going to be a category called your\n\nSpeaker 1: prescriptions. And then in that category, I put a red button with white font that says\n\nSpeaker 2: quick refill. Now you have full autonomy to get refills at your leisure. If you need something\n\nSpeaker 1: stronger, you need something, you want to do a lateral move to Cialis, I'll be your\n\nSpeaker 2: guy. Even if you get anti-climatic within a 30-day period, call me and we'll replace\n\nSpeaker 1: it because what we found is no matter what, you know how the bodies adapt. It's a very\n\nSpeaker 2: intelligent machine and some guys want a different experience. But either way, just click that\n\nSpeaker 1: button or call me and I'll take good care of you again. All right, Ms. Whalen?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Very good. And just to let you know, legally in the state of Nevada, we're not\n\nSpeaker 2: authorized to give you more than one refill per month when you click that button or call\n\nSpeaker 1: me within a 30-day period or two refills a year, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there a confirmation number for that?\n\nSpeaker 1: The confirmation is Alpha 982 F8 9Alpha 9-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's Alpha 982 S8 and what's the rest?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9 9Alpha 9-0. All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Repeat that one more time, if you could, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alpha 982 Foxtrot 8 9Alpha 9-0. And then my name is K.T. Goodrich and my extension\n\nSpeaker 1: is 0037 for your reference. All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you. Thank you, K.T.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you bet. Just give me a call, click that button if you need anything at all. Even\n\nSpeaker 2: if they are too strong and get any adverse side effects, we'll replace these. We'll take\n\nSpeaker 1: care of you. All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thanks for your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you bet. You bet. Adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
