Gittrich from Pfizer's Core Blue Blood.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me, bear with me as I use your telephone number to pull up your account so I can help you put a stop to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just help me verify some information if you don't mind, okay, Damon?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bud. So this 601 number I'm going to use, and then when I pull it up, just correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you're working with Dr. Thomas Bottini. I don't know if you recall.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I do see that Dr. Bottini set you up with a script and a VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the Viagra says 100 milligrams. It's a white diamond pill that we make in our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the FDA-approved one, the Pfizer Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do see that Dr. Bottini has ordered the pharmacy to send you retails on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me put you on hold, bud, so I can put a stop to this, all right, bud? One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
