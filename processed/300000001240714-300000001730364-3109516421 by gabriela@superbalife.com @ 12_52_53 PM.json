I ordered some pills, and they were supposed to be shipped to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, they were shipped to me, and someone stole them off of my porch.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who stole them?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said someone stole them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, someone stole the package off of my porch before I got home.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I went to the post office, and they have a picture of it and everything where they put it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then my ring that I have on my front porch, a guy came up and took the package and left.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, unfortunately, I mean, it got delivered from our end.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can go ahead and place another order. Would you like to place another order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and I want you to send it to my post office box.\n\nSpeaker 1: To your PO box? Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you got a quantity of 40, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it's the same price, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah. I just need them. I mean, I was counting on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. And what is your PO box?\n\nSpeaker 1: The PO box is 13761.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what's the city?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 13761 Golden West Street, number 122, Westminster, California, 92684.\n\nSpeaker 2: 92684.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I have PO box 13761, Westminster, California, 92684.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the address is 13761 Golden West Street.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it's your PO box. I just need the PO box number.\n\nSpeaker 2: 122.\n\nSpeaker 1: PO box 122?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so PO box 122, Westminster, California, 92684.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. So let's get that order in.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, and then can I charge the same visa ending in 6355?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And can you overnight them to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so overnight shipping will be an extra $38.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm going to add those $38. It will be charged on the same card, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, you're all set, Brian. I was able to successfully place in that order for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it should be shipping out tomorrow, not today, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just sucks that people steal stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's horrible. Yes, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: But hopefully you receive it this time since it's getting sent to your PO box. Okay, Brian?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're welcome.
