    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I noticed you guys came out with a new Viagra, and I'm signed up with you guys. I was just wondering how I could order that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that. Give me one second. Pull up your profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it's AGB is what it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Christopher, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: February 25, 1969.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have the AGB. It's the same price. The quantity of 10 is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that for a month's supply?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it comes in a quantity of 10. Then we have 25 for $113.95, and then we have a quantity of 40 for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'd like to just get the lower one. Just try it and see if it's going to work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 100 milligrams. Okay, are we still using the Visa ending in 3187?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: How early do you take it? Just take an hour to work it in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just take it an hour prior, and try to take it on an empty stomach, or just don't eat a fatty meal like a burger or a steak, because that will affect the medication breakdown.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do they keep sending them after that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so they'll put you on automatic refills on a monthly basis, but you can change that now that you have the VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can change it to every two months, every three months, every four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: A lot of people just like to go ahead and put a six-month hold on it. That way it keeps your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that way I could try it and see. Then I just call back and tell them if I want more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay. I'll go ahead and pause you until May 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to make sure it's going to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem. Perfect. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
