    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Marty Parrish.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Marty. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the stuff that I got, I used to take generic Centafil and that's the same pill that I got used to take and it's not the same bottle that y'all showing on this pamphlet y'all sent to me, score of blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: That says Viagra. This here don't even say Viagra. It says generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, this order thing here is not even in the same label on my bottle. And I ordered 10 pills and it does do nothing for me because I took Centafil before. I want the real stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I can definitely help you with this. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-22-60.\n\nSpeaker 1: And is this Marty Parrish?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct. And you're located at 2014 Jason Road, Ormond Beach, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that is correct. Yeah, so you did receive the AGV. I'm looking at the number for it. And we gave you a little bit of a deal on it. But the way you can confirm it's definitely the AGV is the pills themselves, the ones you have on them, they say 1-0-0 on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, that's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the ones that I just received from my doctor says A-V-G-I, 1-0-0. And he gave me six pills and they're blue, not white pills like I used to get from my doctor. Centafil 100. I want the real stuff, not the fake stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you did get what you ordered. You got the AGV. They're white pills. They say 1-0-0 on them for 100. The side of the bottle says Greenstone because that's the manufacturer. The pills, those are the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are. It sounds like you haven't tried them before. You straight up told me that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. You wouldn't be able to know the difference because you haven't even tried them. But you definitely received the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there is nowhere else, definitely not your doctor's office, that you have ever gotten the AGV before. And the reason is we are the direct company with the right to sell it through Pfizer themselves out of their labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. That is definitely the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well let me ask you another question, Hillary. What does the real stuff cost? Because this does nothing for me. I mean, I don't mind paying a few extra dollars, but I want something that's going to work. This don't work. And I used to get this Centafil, just like y'all sent me, generic for Viagra, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I got to tell you two pills didn't make it even close, you know, if that. And I don't understand. I know generic is a generic and it's the cheaper price. I understand that. But do y'all sell the real Viagra original? That's what I want to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, we do. We sell every Pfizer product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now what would 10 pills cost me, the real stuff, not the generic? That's what I want to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the branded Viagra goes for $99 per pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Holy Jesus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long does that last? Do you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: I could ask. You know, a few hours for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, maybe, you know, maybe up to 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right. Lord have mercy. But now it tells you to only take one of these generic pills or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've took two of them and it don't do nothing for me at all. And it tells you not to take two pills within 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right. Did you eat with the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a big no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: That could be why. Did you eat with them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I took one yesterday morning when I got them in the mail. All day long. It didn't do nothing for me at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it says works in 11 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now that's, that's, I think that's BS. Because it don't work for me in 11 minutes. When I get up, I ain't ate nothing yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it says you not to have a full stomach when you take one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I understand. But I just don't understand the same pill that I got from my doctor. 30 days supply. One day a pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was about eight months ago from my doctor. Take one pill a day. And about the third day it starts to work a little bit better. But then I still got to take two of the same generic by Agri.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it says 100 on the pill, but it don't say AGV. And this label that's on this bottle that y'all sent me is don't look nothing like this paper that y'all sent me this brochure.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's three different bottles on the brochure and it's got Viagra on the bottom right of.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this one here is just a generic Viagra, 100 milligrams, Centafil first. It's got the RX number on it. And it says take one hour before sex as needed. Do not take more than one dose in 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the next morning I got up, I took another one and it still ain't done nothing. So I thought this AVG thing was supposed to be better, but it's not better to me. It don't work for me, but I can't afford $100 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now you have, it must be just a, I guess you call it a needle drop in the whole pill in the generic where the full pill is probably a half of the real stuff in a pill. That's the reason it cost you $100 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the AGV, what it is, is it's the newest generic of the blue pill of the branded Viagra from Pfizer. Pfizer developed it and it is the newest generic of that pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it is very similar to that pill, almost a carbon copy. So the thing is, even if you wanted to spend $99 to try that product, they are going to be really, I mean, I think it's worthwhile if you're interested and you want to, but they are, the AGV, it's not, you know, it's not trash. It's not the generic that you can get through your doctor's office or anywhere in the United States. It comes from Pfizer in France and it is the newest and it is a very similar, basically copy, you know, to that blue pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I am sorry to hear that they didn't work for you really, but the thing about it is if those don't work for you, the AGV, then probably what's true is just that there aren't still Denafil products that work for you or are compatible for you, meaning none of Viagra probably works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that doesn't mean nothing works, like Cialis might work because the active ingredient in Cialis is Citalafil, not Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any difference in the Citalafil? I mean, I've heard of it too. I got a couple of buddies taking it. They believe in that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I always believed in the Viagra pills and I said, well, but now, like you said, the Synthafil maybe don't work for me and I know it don't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I mean, what's the difference in the, I'm sorry, what's the difference in the Tadafil versus the Synthafil?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the...\n\nSpeaker 2: In the 100mg, what's the difference in the names of them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the Cialis, it lasts for longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it lasts for longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So one pill can sometimes last for people up to a weekend, but it doesn't act as fast. So it takes a little bit longer to kick in, but then it lasts for longer. And it's just, yeah, it's that different active ingredient of Citalafil versus Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's, the question is always like, which one is more compatible for your body. But yeah, I mean, Sildenafil isn't and maybe Cialis is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I think probably next, well, actually the first of the month. So I live on a social security plan or whatever. And I'm trying to get a job from the school board Wednesday, which I go for an interview, because I'm 65 years old. And I'm too young not for to have what a lady needs, as you would say, because I'm talking to a lady.\n\nSpeaker 2: But now let me ask you another question. Should I try the Tafadil or whatever you said first to see if that works for me better than the Citalafil does?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't want to keep spending money, but I don't mind trying something different, but I can't afford no $100 for one pill. You'd have to cut it in half and make sure if it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what you could do is if you wanted to start with a really small package just like Cialis, just to see if it works for you, you could get four pills for $50 and then hopefully those work. And like I mentioned, one pill can last up to a whole weekend, so they last a little bit longer. And then if they do work, when you order larger packages, it is a lot cheaper. Like for instance, if you were to get 50 pills, you'd get a huge discount. You'd get over 50% off. But you don't want to do that if you don't know yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. That's the reason I only ordered five before. And they're $10 a pill. And I said, well, I'm going to try these five. Well, I guess the Citalafil or Cidentafil, I guess don't work in my body like it's supposed to, or I thought should work anyway, but it don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: So give me another week, week and a half, and then I'm going to try the Cialis and see if that works. And then if that don't work, is the Tafedil the same thing? Is that the Tafedil Cialis? Is that what that is?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right. Okay. I mean, I've heard the name before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: You only get four pills for $50 instead of five of the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So like I mentioned, you could start really small with like just an order of four pills for $40. So, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I got the five pills of the Cialis, that's still $50 anyway?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see. The thing is, I think we only sell them in the small batches in even numbers.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so we do four, we do six, eight, ten.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, four pills don't cost you $40, still $10 a pill, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm going to try that next week when I get paid or something and see if that makes any difference because I'm just going to set these to the side because I don't take two at one time. All these weights, there's like no direction to take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I guess my body is not the same, I guess, to everybody else, I guess, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to try the Cialis next time and they sell it in 100 milligrams too?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, the Cialis is a little bit different. We do 10 milligrams or 20 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it is, it's still just as potent. It's just, um...\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what do the milligrams stand for to me versus a 10 milligram or a 20 and then 100?\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, 100, I would think, would be more potent than the 10 or the 20, I would think.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not a, I'm not a care doctor and I don't know all this. I'm learning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's just, it wouldn't be safe, I think, to take that much of Cialis versus, like Tadalafil versus Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's still really potent stuff. So, yeah, I left a note in here that you're going to call back in the next few weeks to order Cialis and that the H-E-V doesn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Now, is, I mean, don't get me wrong, is the 10 milligram better than the 20 milligram Cialis or the 20 better than the 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to get something that's going to work actually for me, I guess, my body.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't weigh but 160 pounds.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to make sure I get something that's going to actually try to work better.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't mind trying. That's the reason I got scoreboard first.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then I see these other advertisers wear gummies.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this Cialis don't work in 11 minutes on my body.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what, my body must be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But 11 minutes, I said, well, gee, if I get my girl and I'm not married and I go dancing,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm a ballroom dancer and I say, well, this girl wants to go home with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I say, well, I got to take my pill in 11 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't take it right then because I want to make sure we're in privacy, naturally.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I say, well, if I take one first and I don't have a lady yet, I want to see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, nothing's happened all day or all night.\n\nSpeaker 1: I say, well, these don't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So maybe I'm going to try the Cialis and see if that's any different than the Viagra pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if it is, then I'm going to keep getting those, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I want to make the lady happy naturally.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you're a lady.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure you would like that better too, I'm sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, young lady, but I still got your number here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, it's the same number as the score blue number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got it right down here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you want to reach me directly, my extension is 0016.\n\nSpeaker 2: But everybody's super helpful.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0016.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I like to talk to the person that, and even the other guy that I've talked to.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, he put me through the order and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he said, you'll have it within two days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it was four or five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't bother me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to try something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to write the COs, 20 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then 060, no, 0016 is your number.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I like to talk to you because I don't like, I don't know who I'm talking to to begin with anyway, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I just like to talk to the same person and see.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I thought the guy would answer the phone that he gave me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, there's two numbers he gave me, which one of the numbers is the 800-675, which I just called.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, young lady, I'm going to try that in another couple of weeks when I get paid.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to see which, if the COs helps me better than the Viagra does.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just glad I got more information, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And don't get me wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: The other guy didn't know either if the Centafil or Centamofil would work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: He didn't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, but like I said, the doctor gave me prescriptions about eight months ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I only kept it for two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, well, hell, these pills here ain't doing me no dagger good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't waste my time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I said, well, I've got to try something different.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I see the gummies.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, they're a lot more money, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I said, no, no, I don't need all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, got to do without, got to do without.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I'm on a fixed income until I get my job.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I can try different stuff, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, young lady.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those just aren't FDA approved and third party tested.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just be careful out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I don't, I don't like nothing that ain't legit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because y'all's paper says FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Authorized generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Diagram.\n\nSpeaker 1: 25, 50, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give y'all a call back in a couple weeks and let me see what I can get into.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: But nice talking to you and you taught me a lot here on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's even a better thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, young lady.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: And stay warm wherever you're at.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it's going to get cold where I'm at in the morning for a week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I'm in Ormond Beach, Florida, which I got people up north.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're snowed in.\n\nSpeaker 2: They can't go nowhere for a week or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, well, welcome to my world.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I'm a, I'm a Florian and I was born in North Carolina.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I said, well, I like the state of Florida.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like the beach.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I go to church every Sunday and this and that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just love it out here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, nothing else.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your hospitality and telling me, you know, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I say, well, I'm going to try this, try this.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I got to get something that's going to help, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, young lady, you have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: And thank you very much for the information.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll keep in touch.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're quite welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
