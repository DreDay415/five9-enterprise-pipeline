    "text": "Speaker 1: I'm Viagra, Quincy King. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, yeah. I'm calling to cancel my subscription to your pills because I thought I tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is your name Mr. Flynn?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Daniel Flynn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, you don't have to get this when you're not ready for it, sir. You can order this as needed if it's better for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't need to order it at all because it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well if it's not working then we can simply send you something for free, get something else to work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is like a body chemistry type of medication. It could just be that that one wasn't a good fit for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's usually the case and we do have others which we can send for you free of charge to get something to work for you before we, you know, can go any further.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what would you be sending me again?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is one of our other AGVs that we have. It's from a different manufacturer, one from France.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, this is a body chemistry type of medication so usually having a different pill from a different manufacturer usually can be the simple fix of getting something to work and, you know, that is why we send it for free so you can see for yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, you can send it for free as long as it's not automatically refilled and charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it never had to be at all. From your first purchase you could have set this up as needed or however you'd like for it to come out so I can make that change for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do ask that you just give me a call back and let me know if it is working for you or not though, if possible.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way we can, you know, I can set it up for you to order as needed if that works better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm a real old guy so I don't...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, no, I totally understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so my name is Quinn, sir, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would just call that same phone number and you would reach me there after you try these out so you can, you know, let me know how you want to continue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, I'll take care of that as long as, you know...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just give me a call after you try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, usually like I said, that's the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a ring after you try them and, you know, we can set you up so you can order them as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because usually that is, you know, how it works there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got three bottles of this other one that I really don't need.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, I'm good then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, well you're all set, sir. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, bye.",
