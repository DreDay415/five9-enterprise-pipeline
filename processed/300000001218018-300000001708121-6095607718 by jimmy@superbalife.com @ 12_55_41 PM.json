    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on. Hold on a second. Let me take your speaker.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I didn't realize when I got my first subscription that I was put on recurring,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just got a bill through PayPal. I don't know how it went through PayPal,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I want to know how I can get myself taken off this recurring subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can help you with that. Am I speaking to Gary?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Gary. Give me one second. Let me pull you up.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Gary. I see you're getting a Viagra 15 mg, 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like an order just was shipped out to you on the 23rd, I see, as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it just happened. I couldn't call on the weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. All right, Gary. Let me tell you, I was able to stop the monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also stopped the monthly refills for you that was included in your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I also stopped the monthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I do see that you're a VIP with this, so that does give you a little leeway\n\nSpeaker 1: to do certain things with your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: And let me ask you, how was that Viagra 15 mg working for you when you tried those?\n\nSpeaker 1: How did that work out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've actually tried two different kinds, and it didn't seem like it was any different\n\nSpeaker 1: than anything else I've tried.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I think looking at the pill that Score Blue sent me,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was the same pill that I got from – I forget who it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know. I don't even know if I really need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what? Let me do this for you, Gary,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I do see that you had a second order just recently sent to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to make you right, and I want to send you –\n\nSpeaker 1: and, you know, the 15 mg are good, but the 100 mg are so much better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me tell you what individuals do.\n\nSpeaker 1: They take the 100, they try it, and if it's too potent for them,\n\nSpeaker 2: they'll just cut it in half, and that's like bang for their buck.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'm going to do for you, Gary,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you out something for free just for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to charge you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 10 of the 100 mg of the new and improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one that really works really good,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the 100 mg is going to be so much better than the 50 mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me tell you the difference of these.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be a white-shaped diamond pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to put you on a monthly refill like this.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, bear with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Listen to what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you to try these.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to put a pause to everything on your account,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I want to keep your prescription out there because I'm going to change it\n\nSpeaker 2: to what I'm sending you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So whenever you want to order, you can order,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'll get the ones I'm going to send you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not going to have them come to you every month automatically.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to postpone any order for like four months, as far as that's concerned,\n\nSpeaker 1: to make sure that you have a chance to try these.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guarantee you when you try these, you'll see a drastic difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: With these, you're not going to have the same side effects that some people get,\n\nSpeaker 2: like the dizziness and the headaches, and that's their stomachs.\n\nSpeaker 1: They also work faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to last longer, and you're going to see a drastic difference with these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I couldn't swore that's what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did it on my phone, and, of course,\n\nSpeaker 1: the screen is not as big as a computer screen or an iPad.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I could have swore that this was supposed to only take 15 minutes to take effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you don't have those.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have those.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I want to send you out the latest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I thought I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why you're saying what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to send you these out for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm going to send you two of these out for free,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to remove it from every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not getting it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, like I said, I'm going to postpone it for four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That will give you more than enough time to try to see if you like it or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so therefore, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's it mean after four months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they're going to see it on another 10, and it will be for every four months after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you're probably going to order way before then when you try these.\n\nSpeaker 2: Trust me, four months is more than enough time to see if you like it or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to pause it just for four months, and I'm going to try this new pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I like it, I'm going to get auto-charged again after four months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it will be every four months with the same ones I'm sending you out now,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you can always call and postpone it if you want to, too,\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's what I'm setting you up to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: And they're going to be different?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to be the ones I'm sending you out now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because remember, you just got one shipped out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to look like the same one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm still getting that, though, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's still coming to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's coming to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they're going to be different, and I'm going to change the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you do order in the future, you're going to get the ones I'm sending you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be the ones with the one zero zero on the back, if you like them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I don't like them, I can just cancel it, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anytime.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just say, hey, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Jimmy said I tried these.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't like them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I have a feeling when you try them, like Jimmy gave me these,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I want to order 20 of them rather than the 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: But trust me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see what I'm talking about when you try these.\n\nSpeaker 2: These things are supposed to have something else in them besides the Silpadel\n\nSpeaker 1: or whatever it's called.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just new and improved.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Pfizer labs in France have made a better, new, and improved pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to have the same – your label is going to say the same,\n\nSpeaker 2: but only this is going to be 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, if it's too strong, just break it in half.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm telling you, it's going to work for you like you'd be surprised.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not going to have those same effects that a lot of people get,\n\nSpeaker 2: like the dizziness and the headaches and the stomach aches.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have gotten headaches with these other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm trying to tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not going to have that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to see a drastic difference with these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to be – you said it'll be four months now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to hold off for four months,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you can always call and order before then, which I know you probably will.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm keeping you at the discounted price, too, when you do order.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to be upgraded,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I know they're going to go up on the prices real soon,\n\nSpeaker 2: because a lot of stuff comes from the labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anybody that's not on a prescription already,\n\nSpeaker 2: they're going to have to pay for that tear.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's another advantage of keeping your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You said it better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, and if you don't like it, just give us a call like you do now,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you won't get anything after that going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I guarantee you're going to really, really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: These are the best that's out there, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trust me on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they'll have the 100 rate going, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to have the 100, and that's how you can see the difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's going to be a white-shaped diamond pill with the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I got.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: The next one that you're shipping out, let me try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm still getting the shipment that I got an email for the other day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So mine is going to be after that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But mine is going to have the 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one you're going to look for.\n\nSpeaker 2: And there's no charge for you on that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a call back when you're ready to reorder, because I know you're going to want to reorder these.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.",
