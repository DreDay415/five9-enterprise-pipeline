    "text": "Speaker 1: Viagra, can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to cancel my subscription because it said $49 and what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can take a look into your profile. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Russell 726, 76273.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I pulled it up here. So yeah, you bought our Viagra AGV. $49 is the medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a $14 pharmacy fee to dispense it. Total is $63 for the 10 pills that are AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Is this – I don't want it like every 30 days. I just want to try it and then –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the way it works is the prescription, since it's through Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 1: it needs a refill date to become active.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't mean you need to take the second order. It just needs the refill date.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way they can ship out your first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I could do for you, though, is freeze out any future orders to give you an opportunity to try it\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if you even like it. Then call us back as soon as you try it so that we can make a final choice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I want to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, just reach out to us. Other than that, you're all set and your order will ship out tomorrow\n\nSpeaker 2: to arrive in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: And there won't be no more after that until I call you back, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yeah. Just reach out to us after that to confirm if you want to continue or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good day. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.",
