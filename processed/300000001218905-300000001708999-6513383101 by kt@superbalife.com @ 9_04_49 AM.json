    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Bruce, take down my name and number because we're going to work through this and ensure\n\nSpeaker 2: that you get what you intend or what your goal is.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I found is I requested some information from my admin informing me that it was a visa\n\nSpeaker 2: ending at 9667.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I put a stop to any and all monthly refills, I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges, and I paused your prescription and I set you\n\nSpeaker 1: up by starting the credit process so we can ensure that you get the 6395 back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this is how it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I started that, but you're going to have to take down my extension because the process\n\nSpeaker 2: alone could take anywhere from 3 to 10 business days just because we have USPS, then we have\n\nSpeaker 1: the pharmacy, and then we have the banks.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're fast on our end, it's just that other people have their hands in the cookie jar.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just take down my extension bud and just work with me and that way you don't have to\n\nSpeaker 2: wait on line in a few days when you call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why do I have to call back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the credit, I'm going to give you instructions to receive the 6395, I started\n\nSpeaker 1: the credit process, but in order to receive it, you have to send back what you got that\n\nSpeaker 2: you didn't want.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have to incur postage?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, if you haven't opened the package, you don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you said you didn't want them and you have them there, so you probably have\n\nSpeaker 2: two white packages for December and January.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I opened the package to see what it was because I haven't ordered anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, if you could, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: The packages have been opened, I haven't opened the pill bottle, but there's no seal on the\n\nSpeaker 2: pill bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: So all it is is transactional and we'll get you through this, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you have the package though or you discarded it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I discarded it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so at this point, we can just refuse.\n\nSpeaker 2: We are going to have to do return to center, but you will incur like a $10 fee because\n\nSpeaker 1: legally you're not authorized to send pharmaceuticals through the logistically license.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's a nominal fee to get you your 6395, both of them, so you can get these back and\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure you've got them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's work this through though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's work this through.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is K.T. Goodrich, like killer tomato, Bruce.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.T.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodrich, as in tire, like B.F. Goodrich there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure you or someone in Wisconsin uses Goodrich tires and the number here is 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my direct extension so you never have to wait on the line is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so let me give you an address to return this to our pharmacy, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm mailing these pill bottles back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm giving you instructions so we can work together.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to start the credit process now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the pharmacy, just put the name of it as Go-Go Meds, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And trying to get the address.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, I don't have it readily.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll pull it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to pull it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me dig through my garbage.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe I can find the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, don't worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, maybe you could seal it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: But here's how it works with that stuff too, bud, is sometimes these guys,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they're, you know, against Uber and, you know, our USPS isn't doing too well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they always try to charge you and say, oh, you can't pay for these.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's 525 Alexandria Pike Suite 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Zip code is 41071.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's affirmative.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this is how it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just make sure you insure, Bruce, because your name is on the prescription already.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll know exactly when they stand the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm starting the process of return to credit and return to sender on my end.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way the instructions work is take it back to the USPS, refuse, right,\n\nSpeaker 1: refuse, return to sender on it, the big black marker, give it to the pharmacist,\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, to the postal gentleman or woman, allow the process to take place\n\nSpeaker 1: within three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll get to Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacist will scan it in about 48 hours and then call me next week\n\nSpeaker 2: around Thursday, and then we'll release the funds to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you can verify that they got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just I'm going to make note that and start the process for December\n\nSpeaker 2: and January, and that you haven't tried it out yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to any and all charges and shipments, and I pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you have time to try these out in December, I mean, the November,\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how these things go, and we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's get you back the money.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's have you try this when you get a girlfriend or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just stick with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have your 12 and I have your 6.\n\nSpeaker 2: As a veteran and American, I pledge allegiance to my brothers and sisters\n\nSpeaker 1: and to the flag to the day I die, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let's take care of you, and this is how we roll.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, Mr. Wagner?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's go for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's have fun because we're not here a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're here for a good time.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll get you back that money.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Stay in touch with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do the same for me, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would do the damn same for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about the snap.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
