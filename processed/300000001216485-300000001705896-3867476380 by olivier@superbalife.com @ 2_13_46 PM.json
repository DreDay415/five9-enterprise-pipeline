    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hello? Hello, how are we doing, sir? Okay. I'm pulling your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I want to cancel it. Mr. Roy Crumpler in Seville, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, that's me. Any health concern or you just don't need refill often?\n\nSpeaker 2: Pardon me? Any health concern or you just don't need refill at the moment? You want me to advise the pharmacy to pause your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're just going to order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't want to be on a normal prescription every month basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'm going to tell the pharmacy to pause. What happened, they just fulfilled what the doctor wrote in the prescription initially but you don't have to follow that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Every month is not a requirement. You don't have to get pills that you don't need every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to advise the pharmacy to pause. They usually pause you up to half a year and then you don't get it every month anymore and then you can lock your pricing by getting a refill once or twice a year, maybe 10 pills if you don't need 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't even have to get 25. It's up to you, okay? So let me advise the pharmacy to pause that prescription so you don't get it every month, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, they won't send it until I call them, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they'll pause you and then you can call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one moment.",
