    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi there. I'm trying to get a hold of Angel. Does he still work there?\n\nSpeaker 1: He's been out. He works here, but he's been out. What can I help you with, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I had an order pending with him for, I thought, 60-20 mg Cialis every 5 months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I got an order in today from Kentucky for only 30-20 mg Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, is the RX number, would that help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, your name and zip code does, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 2: Your name and zip code helps me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Richard Richards, 8003.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Gray Street?\n\nSpeaker 1: Arvada, Colorado.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I don't see a note about that, but I will have them send you another 30.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't see that he set that agreement up?\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that he changed the frequency for you, and it is Cialis, but I see he has it set at 30.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see a note that he said it should have been 60.\n\nSpeaker 2: When did he change it?\n\nSpeaker 1: You switched over from 24 pills to 30 at the end of December 2024.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you don't show anything for us?\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have a 60 pack, so that's why I, like, I mean, I, like, I don't know what agreement you came to,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't doubt that you spoke to him, because I see he has notes in here about your orders,\n\nSpeaker 1: but we don't even do a 60 pack usually, so I'm not sure what happened with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well...\n\nSpeaker 1: But he did give you a much better price on the 30 than normal,\n\nSpeaker 2: because normally 30 pills is like $200, and he's only charging you $108.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know, I'm older, so I must be mistaken about that for some dumb reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: In fact, I thought it was 30, I thought it was 60 every five months, and you're showing it's 30 every five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir, but I do see he gave you a better price, so maybe that's what the compromise was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe you had wanted more pills, but he said, I can give this to you at a cheaper price or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: That may have been what the deal was, because he's giving you a deal on your price here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what's the normal price for 30?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like $214, you're getting it for $108.\n\nSpeaker 2: Really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so he definitely set you up well with the pricing.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want me to change the frequency, I can.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want it a little more often, I can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Otherwise, I can keep it every five months, if that's what you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, for now, let's leave it as is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure I'm the one making the mistake here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm glad you called and we could talk that out, though, so at least you know you can get a deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes I forget what I had for lunch yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: My mistake here.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
