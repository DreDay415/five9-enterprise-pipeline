    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. I just received another shipment of prescriptions, and I need to cancel this. I'm not even using them these days, unfortunately. I lost my wife, and so I don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. Okay, so what's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Thomas Tippens, T-I-P-P-E-N-S, and the date of birth is 5-29-1952.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Tom. Okay, yeah, that's definitely understandable. So what I can go ahead and do for you is that I can go ahead and just pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause it for half a year, and maybe during that time you find someone else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, can we just cancel it altogether, and I can pick it up if needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just 174, and I don't know how much I'm earning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the thing is that since we are the only company in the U.S.\n\nSpeaker 2: that sells FDA-approved Viagra and we have the contract with Pfizer, our supply is on a high demand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you cancel, that means that that would be canceling the prescription and the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you wouldn't be able to reorder in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you decide to pause it for six months, that means that you wouldn't be getting billed during that time,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if you need to extend that pause later on, you can always do so.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, but I just need to go ahead and cancel it,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't want to have to be with it six months or a year from now, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, you're all set. It's been canceled moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good day. Bye, Tom.",
