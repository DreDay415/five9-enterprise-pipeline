    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. I just got a bill. I was checking my bank account and I just noticed I got a bill from Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't believe that I ordered any Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Brian Smith, 11-13-1949.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Brian. Yes, so the reason why you received another order is because you do have a prescription with us for Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is the reason why you received another order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, listen, back in August, I got an order and they told me at that time that I had to get another order before the year was out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yes, they sent me one in December. And that was supposed to be the end of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you just paused it, which is why you saw bills again this month. So it looks like you are getting a quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription is for a quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When I spoke to the last salesperson, they told me I wouldn't have to buy anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you need to take me off. You need to take away this $63 charge because I don't need it. I've still got plenty of Score Blue pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you need to take me off of this cycle.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have enough supply at this time, Brian, what we can go ahead and do is that we can pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can pause it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can pause it forever. You can cancel it. You can pause it forever. I don't want anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you cancel, that means you wouldn't be able to reorder with us in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: What?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you cancel, that means you wouldn't be able to reorder with us in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay. Are you telling me we can pause your prescription for six months and then I'm going to get another prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, in six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want to. I don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, just to let you know, we are the only company in the U.S. that sells FDA approved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine. I'm 76 years old, sweetheart.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we do have some guys that are older than you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What? What?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, who take it. So do you want to pause it for six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: We can go ahead and do that and just pause your prescription for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that way you would still be allowed to reorder with us in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I want the $63 refunded to my bank account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, just be aware that you're not going to be able to order with us in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine. Look, I understand that and I'm willing to not order it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, you're all set, Brian. The order has been canceled and you have been refunded $62.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should be getting that refund within the next three to five business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what if I don't get the refund? What is my recourse?\n\nSpeaker 2: You will be receiving it because I just completed the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days, Brian.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a nice day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
