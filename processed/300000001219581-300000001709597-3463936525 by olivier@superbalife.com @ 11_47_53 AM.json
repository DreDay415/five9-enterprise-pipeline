I want to...\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered some pills online and I request you to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I received an email that says cancel, but it's still saying I have to call and confirm.\n\nSpeaker 2: The order number I have is 426-742.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you enter what name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I used the phone number you're calling me from and the account is empty.\n\nSpeaker 2: So maybe, did you use a different phone number to place your order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or maybe a different name than M. Norman?\n\nSpeaker 2: M. Norman.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have an empty account under those credentials.\n\nSpeaker 2: So maybe you could have used a different credential by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Phone number I'm calling you from is 346-393-6525.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see your profile, but there is no order.\n\nSpeaker 1: The other phone number, it could be...\n\nSpeaker 2: 8...\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry I don't use that phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe it got entered in the system somehow.\n\nSpeaker 2: 832-983-3033?\n\nSpeaker 1: 832-983-3033?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe an email address by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, M. Norman...\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, did you receive...\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you receive...\n\nSpeaker 2: Question, I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you receive an actual order or did money was taken?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I haven't received any order yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: I received an email, but I got charged in my account, on my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: When did you show the charge though?\n\nSpeaker 1: The charge I saw on January 26th, 6395.\n\nSpeaker 2: January 26th.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, did you receive any text or email?\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you did...\n\nSpeaker 1: I received an email when I ordered and I changed my mind.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I sent an email on January 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: On January 27th, I sent an email that I wanted to cancel,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I received an email right after that on January 27th\n\nSpeaker 1: that your request has been updated to add additional comment reply.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that means everything was cancelled then?\n\nSpeaker 1: But on January 27th, today I received an email\n\nSpeaker 2: that due to overwhelming demand for FDA approved elements,\n\nSpeaker 1: it says to process with cancelling your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: please call our toll free number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that could be an automatic message.\n\nSpeaker 2: How many email addresses do you have?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have two or three of them, let me try each of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll give you this email address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sheenexpress786 at gmail.com\n\nSpeaker 2: Sheenexpress786 at gmail.com\n\nSpeaker 1: Sheenexpress786 at gmail.com\n\nSpeaker 2: There we go. I found you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mohammed Norman.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yeah, I see your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why do you want to cancel your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was just too expensive.\n\nSpeaker 1: I cannot afford it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the doctor approved you already too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I know. I must wait a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to wait a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's too expensive right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I cannot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have to wait a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I'm taking some other medication,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I have to check with my doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I just found out I cannot take any,\n\nSpeaker 1: like this type of pill right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The painkillers I'm taking right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, painkiller is not a problem with that, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: He just told me I have to visit,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they will let you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, I'm canceling your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, the doctor already approved you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the refund will be $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: You also just keep in mind,\n\nSpeaker 1: when you place an order like that,\n\nSpeaker 2: when the doctor approved you,\n\nSpeaker 1: we already financed a consultation for you, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: They did that doctor running the prescription as a cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep that in mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why when you try to reorder,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you see the order not going through,\n\nSpeaker 1: or the price is more expensive,\n\nSpeaker 2: it could be because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: you lost the consultation.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're financed.\n\nSpeaker 1: The company got to finance another one for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, just be aware of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But everything that's been canceled,\n\nSpeaker 2: you have been refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will I receive any confirmation by email or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't need anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just wait.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, you might not even be able to reorder,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they already paid for the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you canceled that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it's, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: we'll see which lucky if you try to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe you can be lucky,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going to take the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, everything's canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just to lock up a business.\n\nSpeaker 2: They will say usually $5 to $10 to be safe,\n\nSpeaker 1: but based on your bank,\n\nSpeaker 2: it can be sooner than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
