How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I called you because I want to change my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to change my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: My zip code is 13904.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 21 Abbott Street in Binghamton?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I see you're getting the 50 milligram generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What did you want to change to, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I need Gardasil 20 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah, I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Same four pills, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a moment to make that switch.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you did say 20, right? 20 milligram?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Tadalafil. No problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then do you want me to use the same Visa card, 6084?\n\nSpeaker 2: What?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want me to use the Visa card ending in 6084?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to update for Tadalafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same price you were paying, so nothing's changed there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's just going to be Tadalafil 20 milligrams now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're good to go, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.",
