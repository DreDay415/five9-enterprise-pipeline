What does that mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: The same thing you ordered the first time.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is it? I don’t evenÖ what is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, how many?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ten of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ten for $63? I didn’tÖ can you cancel it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is $63 an issue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, can youÖ yeah, yeah, I didn’t even try what you sent me the first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don’t know why I’m getting it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, because you didn’t set it up to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn’tÖ\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you didn’t set up your orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn’t see that. Or I would have.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. I hear you loud and clear, but that is why that happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, it didn’t say as needed orÖ\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, how often are they sending it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Whoever you would like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, how long do you have it scheduled for? I don’tÖ I wanted it the one time.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that’s when you have to get it, sir. That’s what “up to you” means.\n\nSpeaker 1: It means that you can choose when you get it or don’t.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so right nowÖ so can you tell when they have it scheduled or you can’t tell me that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now you have one that just went out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, when is the next one?\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be a monthly dose of 10 pills. So that would beÖ we sent you another monthly dose.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it would be another month before you get another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you cancel it? Can you cancel that whole thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, why did you ask me how it was set up now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I don’t know howÖ I didn’t know that I was getting another one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had no idea if it’s once a month or once every sixÖ\n\nSpeaker 1: You don’t have to get it once a month. You can choose. That’s what we started the conversation with.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to see what it was about, the first product, and I don’t even know that yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: We’re going to go ahead and cancel you out. Don’t worry about it. It’s too difficult.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.",
