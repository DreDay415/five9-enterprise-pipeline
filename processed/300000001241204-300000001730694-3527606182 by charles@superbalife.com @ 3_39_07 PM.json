I'm one of your customers, and you guys sent me the wrong stuff, and now I got more today.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the new Viagra supposed to say on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV should have the number depending on the dosage. If you got 50 milligrams, it should have 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you got 100, you should have 100 pressed onto it like a stamp.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what it's got.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, then these first ones you sent me, what do I do with those?\n\nSpeaker 2: First ones we sent you. Is this Robin Hendricks?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you sent me the wrong ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, I see that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Today, I got more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I see that. Yeah, we reshipped them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those ones, the first ones that you got are made in America.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to try them, try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then those ones are made in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then compare them.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGVs?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they're both AGVs.\n\nSpeaker 1: One's just made in France, one's made here in America.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, to start out, can I take half of one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I always say if you're taking 100, take the 100 first, see what it does to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you feel like that was way too much, just cut it in half and that would be 50,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then try it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you just want to stick with 50 and play it safe, play it safe and take the 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, buddy. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to make sure I got the right ones this time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thank you. Bye.",
