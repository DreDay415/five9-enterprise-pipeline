Can you hear me clearly?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hi, James. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. Thank you for asking. So, Olivia, I'm just trying to check if my account is still active with you guys because the last time that I paid for it was last November 14, 2025 for $100.95. Can you look it up for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. What's the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Here. It would be 281-415-0444.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. Can you repeat that?\n\nSpeaker 2: 281-415-0444.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. And what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, I'm not comfortable in providing that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, you're the second impersonator that's called for pretending to be James Butler to access his medical information, which is protected legally by HIPAA guidelines. So, this is illegal, what you're doing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it'll be noted. This is the second time it's happened, and it's not acceptable, and you and your company are on watch.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I hope you have a great day.",
