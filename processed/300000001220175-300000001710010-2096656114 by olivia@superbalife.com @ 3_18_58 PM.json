My name is Robert Cody.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Robert. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tired.\n\nSpeaker 1: I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, same. How can I help you today, Robert?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. I noticed you just billed me. I was wondering if I could cancel. Your product's not working for me anymore because my back has gotten too bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm so sorry about that. Okay, yeah. Let's go see about you, Robert. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: March 7, 1960.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Okay, yeah. So this refill from today, you do not need it. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, they can let that order go through, but after that, I don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Just so you know, this is so weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's a problem, they could stop that one if it makes it tougher. I just, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's fine. I'm hoping after back surgery, maybe it'll get better, but right now, the canal in my back's almost closed, so the surgeon's telling me,\n\nSpeaker 1: yeah, you can't do shit, so yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Well, you know where to find us in the future, and I hope, you know, everything with your back turns out okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Me too. Yeah, your prescription is canceled, and I do think, so that one hasn't gone out yet, but I think it will, even though I canceled the script. I think that should be fine, and if not, what will happen is they will end up just refunding you, but it'll be one or the other in the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's the new one, right? The ABA or whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGB. Yeah, it's just like the last one that you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because the ones before that were crappy, and these were barely working, but it was better than nothing. It's just the pain's so bad,\n\nSpeaker 2: I just can't take it anymore, so anyways, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. Paper can be in my dresser drawer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, have a great day, Robert. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Okay. Bye now.",
