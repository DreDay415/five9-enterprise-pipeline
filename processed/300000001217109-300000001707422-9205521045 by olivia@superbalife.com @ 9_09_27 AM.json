This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Mark Lloyd.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Mark. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, not too bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, listen, you guys had me on an auto order thing or something because I got another package in the mail from you, and I want to be removed from that list.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mark. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Fall 28, 1965.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And you're located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I do see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know, Mark, I do see that you have a ton of pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do always have the option, just so you know, if you don't want to receive regular orders with your prescription, you don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is you could still order during that duration of time.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, if you need anything before July 26, six months from now, just give us a call at this number Monday through Friday, 8-5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and so I won't get any next month, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. Definitely not, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mark.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, Barb.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
