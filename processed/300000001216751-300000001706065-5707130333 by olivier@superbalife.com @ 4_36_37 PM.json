Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Reporting prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to get your chocolate.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my God.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Rick Fay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I see that you're a VIP and you have a prescription for Vagra 50 mg from Dr.\n\nSpeaker 2: Williams, 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just don't need it as often at the moment?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to take a break?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, they work, but my doctor told me to quit because of my high blood\n\nSpeaker 2: pressure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, what I would do, and that's good that you mentioned that,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can advise the pharmacy to put a pause due to blood pressure issues.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way you can work with your doctor and clear it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: They can take you off for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then also, even when you resume, you don't have to get it as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way when you try to get your Vagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: you don't have to pay a new price company here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to pay,\n\nSpeaker 1: finance a new doctor consultation and change your price because of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way you can work with the physician and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: they're probably going to give you meds and put that under control.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as soon as that's done, usually you can resume and get your Vagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're not even getting 100, you're getting 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: So usually that's what patients do.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have a medical situation or, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: usually you pause and then you just reorder when it's cleared out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just call here, we place a note and, you know, based on your status.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I decide to start back up, I'm going to call you back.\n\nSpeaker 1: As of right now, I don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I'm going to pause you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that okay to pause you for half a year and you can call back to update?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. Just be advised.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to place notes that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you will have a different price because they're going to have to reinvest for\n\nSpeaker 1: you. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Get you a new doctor to write a new prescription for your Vagra when you\n\nSpeaker 1: decide to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You're all set. Okay. Mr. Faye, everything's have been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I placed note. You declined to be paused to save your price and reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all set. You have a good one. And I hope.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
