    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, how you doing? Um, I was sent a prescription of a score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can't take them anymore so I need to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel the subscription or prescription that you guys are sending me. The side effects are just too bad for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't take them anymore. Okay, not a problem. Can I have your phone number so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, it's 9 1 7 8 2 8 0 5 5 6.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that didn't pull up. Did you use a different one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you have—what? Could you read it back to me? I just deleted it. Okay, so 9 1 7—\n\nSpeaker 1: 8 2 8 0.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5 5 6.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now let's try. I have 9 1 7 8 2 8 0 5 5 6.\n\nSpeaker 2: What about your email address?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's knockknockboom@yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's KNOCK KNOCK again. Knockknockboom at yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: There we go. Paul, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 3 21 71.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. If you're a VIP customer, okay, do you happen to have the medication on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you tell me what's imprinted on an individual pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Want to know if it says AC on the pill? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC3, yeah, AC 340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's exactly what I thought. Okay. So those are just regular generic Viagra. You did not receive the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think the pharmacy probably ran out and didn't tell us, so we screwed up your order. Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna get you out a replacement and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you receive the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why it's not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: So these are—\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so Paul, when you get this new bottle in the mail in a few days, on the bottle—\n\nSpeaker 1: It's gonna say AGV, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's—\n\nSpeaker 1: Manufacturer in France. And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you receive the FDA-approved Pfizer Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those generics, just go ahead and toss them in the trash can. And then what I'm going to do—\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it till July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I can't do that now, it's going to delete your profile.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pharmacy wouldn't be able to send you out that replacement. And then I'll give you my extension—\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can call me back and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, one second, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, my extension is 0020 and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm, and—\n\nSpeaker 1: What number is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then I also made a note to the pharmacy to make sure there's a total of 80. And I know—\n\nSpeaker 2: We owe you another—\n\nSpeaker 1: Another 40. So give me a call to get those delivered and I can send you out the other 40.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so—\n\nSpeaker 2: So these are—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, those are generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the new pill will just only have 100 imprinted on the pill and then on the bottle—\n\nSpeaker 1: It will say Greenstone, which is Pfizer's manufacturer in France because I know your bottle now says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone, yeah, the new bottle will say—your bottle now says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when could you get those after me? Yeah, they're gonna ship them out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you get them in about five days or less?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, don't email you a tracking number too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, very good. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, no problem. I'll have a great week.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Bye. Bye.",
