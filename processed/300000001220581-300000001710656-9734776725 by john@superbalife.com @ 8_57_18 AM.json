    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm calling about a tracking number. I've been tracking a package and it seems like it came and went.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going back again. It didn't get delivered twice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Eugene Cooper 32940.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I see what you're talking about, sir. I'm not exactly sure. I'm not the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I would suggest is you call the post office with that tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And ask them why it went back to North Carolina after it was just in Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be your best bet.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they tell you something like we were returning it or it got lost or something, we'll just reship it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I would check with them first because I don't have a reason for why it's doing that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I see what you're saying, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay. It never was delivered. I don't know. It's kind of weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've got to call the post office because I don't work for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So give them that tracking number. They'll have more information on what's going on with that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they tell you it's lost or it's not going to arrive...\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I have to go there or I can call? Is there a number to call?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's super easy, sir. You just look up your local post office number.\n\nSpeaker 1: And give them that tracking number that you already have. That's all you have to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
