    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I was calling to get some information. I had had an order that I had placed.\n\nSpeaker 1: And in the – when you do the preliminary where you kind of get your information, they actually hadn't tried any other types.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I had put what I had tried before. And so my order was supposed to be actual Viagra, period.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they sent me that sentence form.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: First name is Richard. Last name is Strzok.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Strzok, I have your information up here. I see the prescription should have been written for our new Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And is that not what you got?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not what I got. They sent me that Sildenafil or whatever they call it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay. So the pill still will be technically named Sildenafil, but that doesn't mean that what you got is correct or incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but it says generic on it for Viagra is what it says.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's what the AGV stands for, Authorized Generic Viagra. It is – it's basically their generic version.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're from Pfizer. But what is – do you have those pills there in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: You could have still gotten the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me grab them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me grab them real quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the important thing is the manufacturer, where it comes from, and I'll be able to tell that in just a second when you get the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that. If you did get the wrong thing, of course, I'll send you a replacement order. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's just make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send these back to you, whatever. All right. What would you need?\n\nSpeaker 1: What do the markings on the actual pills say, Mr. Strzok?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get one out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. It says AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so that definitely is incorrect. You're right about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is a generic pill. That's not the Viagra AGV that you should have gotten, Mr. Strzok.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, like I said, I'm going to send you out a replacement order of these 10 pills stat.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see those come by before Friday for sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to charge you. Of course, you've already paid the pills that you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to keep them. You can toss them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to send them back or anything like that because we're not going to resell them or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are still like American-made generic Viagra, just very similar to what the guys get from the VA.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to send you that new order right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are going to come by in the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry about that, Mr. Strzok.\n\nSpeaker 1: When this new order comes out, the markings on the pills will be different,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the label will indicate the AGV as well, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'll send these back that way you normally get.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I just got them today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about that. That's our mistake, Mr. Strzok.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to send that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Keep them. You can save them for a rainy day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can dispose of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about sending them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to make sure because I thought they were the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, well, that's not really what I thought I was ordering.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you were correct about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is a mix-up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to reach out to the pharmacy, and you won't see that happen again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set then, Mr. Strzok.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll see that come out in the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Leo, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm the one who helped you out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I appreciate it so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you think you'll be here, when do you think?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I know Wednesday, Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wednesday. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate your help so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll enjoy the rest of your day, Mr. Strzok.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
