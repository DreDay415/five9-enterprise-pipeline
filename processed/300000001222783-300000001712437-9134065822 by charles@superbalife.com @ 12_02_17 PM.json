    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, how's it going?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty good. How about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I guess. How do we cancel this stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you out. Timothy went in Ottawa, Kansas.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Okay, Timothy, it does look like you are a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you just not need the pills as often as every single month?\n\nSpeaker 1: And need to pump the brakes for a while?\n\nSpeaker 2: What did you say again, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you need to pump the brakes for a while on receiving anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you just not need them every month?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need them very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're getting older, and the wife is not interested that much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, man. I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, what we can do is pause everything for six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, it doesn't come every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: It would be like once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you're able to call in and request them as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll make sure this is the last one you get for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what are you going to do? Say it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause any future refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not going to charge you or send you anything for six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay? It will only come once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then if you need them earlier,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can call in and request them as needed as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so twice a year basically, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: If she gets in the mood, I'll give you a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. Exactly. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good, Timothy. I will set that up for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing else to worry about. Just give us a call if you need them earlier.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there one underway now, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I'm going to make sure that's the last one for a while, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take that. I'll be all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sounds good. All right, Timothy. Hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you very much. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care. Bye-bye.",
