    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. This is Henry Dishart. I had returned some medicine to you guys, and I wanted to find out if you received it and when I can expect the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And you said you sent it back when?\n\nSpeaker 2: When did you send it back, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: When did you send it back?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know the exact date, but it's been a couple of weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know it's been received because I sent it where I got a receipt. I sent it in Tuesday, Monday before I left, so I'm thinking, like, Thursday of that week, so probably, like, last Thursday or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just basically what it says is it says it was at the PO Box ready for pickup, so I don't know how long, you know, how often you guys pick them up for the box that you guys use, but I sent it back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what about the AGD that we sent you in the mail, the one we sent out on December 16th? Did you have an opportunity to try that?\n\nSpeaker 2: I did. It just didn't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You and I have talked, and that's the reason I contacted you directly. You sent me out a hundred, and it didn't work, and so I sent you back the 50 because I asked if I could get a refund on the second one, because I wasn't aware that it was a subscription anyhow.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was thinking it was just, you know, I order them when I get them, and you explain to me, you know, it's a subscription, and then you suggested to try the hundred, but you sent them in. It didn't work that much better.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so you said if I sent you back the 50, you know, then you'd be able to refund that second charge that you guys, you know, charged me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'll go ahead and issue the refund for that second order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Will that go back on the card, or how will that be?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's going to go back on the card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Visa ending in 5339.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've gone ahead and done that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, I know you don't care, but I'm going to go see a urologist.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe there's a little more going on with this medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Although we're FDA approved, and, you know, if there's something else going on, it might be worth getting it checked out, and maybe your doctor has another solution.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyhow, thanks for trying it out, and I'm sorry it didn't end up working out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, and you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've issued that refund for that second order of yours.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could take five to ten business days, but it's already been issued on our end.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll check it sometime next week or something, see where we're at.\n\nSpeaker 2: As I don't see it in about three weeks or so, I'll give you a holler back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I figure that should be plenty of time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds like a plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for calling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
