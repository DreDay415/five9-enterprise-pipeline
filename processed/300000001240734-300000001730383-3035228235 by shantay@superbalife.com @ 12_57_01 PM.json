And there's two of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they say those are from the doctor. I mean, they're not asking me anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just seems like we're stuck in some endless loop.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't look like there's anything else that she needs from you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm just going to confirm with her that you already put the ordering\n\nSpeaker 1: and you want to move forward with the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm not on the auto replenish, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me check.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you are not. It's a one-time order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.
