    "text": "Speaker 1: I was told to call into customer service by Tamra because I tried one of y'all's products.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it didn't work well for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can take a look into your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: The last name is Scott.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I pulled up your profile here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we can, if you'd like, what we can do is send you out a higher dose.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you can see if maybe that makes a difference, but let me just actually take\n\nSpeaker 2: a look here at my system to see what the difference, oh no, it would just be two of the pills you're\n\nSpeaker 1: taking.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are the, what are, how many pills have you tried in one, in one day?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, as I said, I tried, I did the first one and it was like, it was phenomenal.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was fantastic, you know, especially since I had a friend of mine, a lady friend of mine\n\nSpeaker 2: came in from Brazil.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was very, very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I tried five after that and I'm like, what the hell happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, never got the same result after that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm like, I don't understand how can it work so well and then be minimal after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, minimal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it just depends on the situation because you, were you drinking any alcohol?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you eat food?\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you on an empty stomach?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't drink.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you, were you on an empty stomach or did you eat any food?\n\nSpeaker 2: What?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, were you on an empty stomach or did you consume any food?\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, I probably ate.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't remember exactly when I ate.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not supposed to eat while you're on these.\n\nSpeaker 1: What?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're supposed to be on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're supposed to eat after you're done with activity.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you consume any food while taking these, all of the actual medication will attach itself\n\nSpeaker 1: to the food and you're not going to be able to digest it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't remember exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, but it's just best to always take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll ask me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I should have been about three hours, two to three hours from before taking that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you have to be on an empty stomach completely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, that's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, why is yours like that?\n\nSpeaker 2: If I had to buy Viagra, they don't say that with theirs and it worked okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Never had that problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's in the prescription, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was texted to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, if you like, you can always send the remaining pills back for the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you mentioned how you tried more than one already.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, increasing the dosage won't really change anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: The best solution, you know, just for you to be sending back whatever you have left\n\nSpeaker 2: over for the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'd like.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it did work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, the first time was fantastic and I don't remember if I ate or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to spend any money to resend it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we're not going to pay for the return shipping, but if you'd like to get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to be out money.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can't send it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but what I'm saying is if you want to be out, you're not going to be out any money\n\nSpeaker 2: for the most part.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get your refund back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it's mainly you have to send it back for the refund or you could just keep the remaining\n\nSpeaker 1: product and try it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for the most part, you would need to send it back if you want to get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you were offering to send a stronger dose.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why don't we try that?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because you've already explained you tried multiple of these pills at once.\n\nSpeaker 2: It won't make a difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, fuck me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I knew this was going to be a fuck job.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew this was going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a pretty straightforward thing, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you already took more than one pill at once, then it's going to honestly not make\n\nSpeaker 2: a difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not at once.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't take more pills than once.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you mentioned that you've taken around five.\n\nSpeaker 2: Around the time frame that you've given, it's taking it around the same way, which is why\n\nSpeaker 1: I gave you the solution to just return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know it's not the same way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're assuming so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're assuming a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried one in the morning when I've been asleep all night.\n\nSpeaker 2: I took one in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't eat anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't drink anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't eat anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't sleep.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not the same way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're assuming so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're assuming a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to end up telling you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried one in the morning when I've been asleep all night.\n\nSpeaker 1: I took one in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't eat like right after.\n\nSpeaker 2: I woke up early because she likes to work till around the morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: I took on early in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: It never worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: We didn't eat breakfast until 9.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: I offered you just the solution to send it back for the refund, or email you the return\n\nSpeaker 2: instructions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Other than that, that would be the main solution for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can get the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, you can give me a week.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way I can give her a refund at 6 a.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: I told you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the guarantee, so that's what you would take advantage of.\n\nSpeaker 1: For the most part, I've been pretty calm with you, even though you've been just cussing\n\nSpeaker 2: the whole time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to send you the return instructions at this point, sir, because if you continue\n\nSpeaker 2: to just keep cussing, I'm just going to have to drop the call.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to trash you all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fuck you.",
