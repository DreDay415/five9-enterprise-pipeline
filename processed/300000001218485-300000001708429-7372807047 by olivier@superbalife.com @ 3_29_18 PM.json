    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, listen, this is Javier Vela here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am calling because I just got a text message from your company stating that they made another\n\nSpeaker 2: charge on my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now here's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had already contacted your company and the doctor who's supposedly in charge of this\n\nSpeaker 1: medication had sent me an e-mail or I can't remember if it was an e-mail or a text message.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, I sent a reply back to him and I stated that the first shipment I was only\n\nSpeaker 1: able to take two of those capsules and that I had a bad reaction and I ended up having\n\nSpeaker 2: to go to the emergency room.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now having said that, they still went ahead and sent a second shipment which is still\n\nSpeaker 2: intact.\n\nSpeaker 1: It hasn't even been touched or opened since I received it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I stated that I didn't want to have any more shipments sent out because my doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: suggested that I stop taking those medications.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now I don't understand why you guys did another charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the third charge on my debit card, on my credit card, mind you, and that is a\n\nSpeaker 2: fraud.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's like a fraud that your company has done and I did not approve that because I\n\nSpeaker 2: had already specified to that freaking doctor that I wanted to cancel the completion.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me fix that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me fix that for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe because you sent an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why it was disconnected.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe your connection was lost instead of cancelling.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to reverse that last refill for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to cancel your account, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you need to credit that credit card of mine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You need to reverse that charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm doing right now, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm doing, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's move forward, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me finish talking first, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Understand that I'm trying to say a word.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to put in a word.\n\nSpeaker 2: Since you called, I've been letting you speak so far.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no, you're not because I was just going to say that I asked to send me a shipping\n\nSpeaker 2: label, a return shipping label to send that second shipment back because, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: I never opened it because after that first shipment, I only used two capsules and the\n\nSpeaker 2: bottles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, you all sent a second shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you all are fixing to send a third and you all charged my credit card and I cannot\n\nSpeaker 1: be charging my credit card anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I specifically said I wanted this totally canceled and credited the second bottle that\n\nSpeaker 1: I received.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I am willing to send it back and I specified that and you all didn't do anything about\n\nSpeaker 1: it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You all never sent a return label.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me help you and fix that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're already repeating the same information.\n\nSpeaker 1: I fully understand the concern and what is the issue and what we got to do to fix the\n\nSpeaker 2: problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me help you so you can go about your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I refunded you the last processing charge, $113.95, which was the one that was just processed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you mentioned the second shipment, it was not open.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't need a shipping label.\n\nSpeaker 2: What are you going to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to write on the actual package that you received two words, refused return\n\nSpeaker 2: on that package that you have and then you can put that in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: When the mailman will see that, he's going to take that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have time to spare, you can also stop by the post office and throw that in the shipping\n\nSpeaker 1: box.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can do that as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will take it to the post office and I hope they will send it back because other times\n\nSpeaker 2: it's happened before like that where people put return or refuse and the post office didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: want to do anything about it because they said they got to get paid for shipping the\n\nSpeaker 2: merchandise back to the company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just trust our package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just do what I'm telling you to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't overthink.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm here for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just take that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just write on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they need anything, we will figure it out but usually that package is good enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: We pay for that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can return that.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've done.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just put refuse return and your package is not even open so that's even better.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even if you leave it in your mailbox, that's even better because when the mailman see that,\n\nSpeaker 2: he thinks that it was a mistake but when you go to the post office, sure enough, you're\n\nSpeaker 1: sure it's going somewhere but they might say, oh, you tried to do a shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you leave it in your mailbox, it's not your fault.\n\nSpeaker 1: Something's came.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like somebody, you live in an apartment.\n\nSpeaker 2: They send you a mail from the previous tenant.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just write refuse on a letter return.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have nothing to pay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not your fault if it got to you so that one, that's what you want to make it seem\n\nSpeaker 2: like.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got the wrong package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Refuse.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you see that, you get that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Listen.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need you to credit my card company for that second shipment that I'm fixing to send back.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will be credited.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, when you do that, just because we're going to be able to see that from the\n\nSpeaker 1: tracking number attached to that package, so just do what I said and then you're going\n\nSpeaker 2: to get your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Matter of fact, as we speak, I already refunded you the one where it's just processed and\n\nSpeaker 2: then when you do the other one, you're going to get the refund for the other one and then\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm canceling the account because you say you have some type of side effect and stuff\n\nSpeaker 2: like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: What we could have done was just call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: We would have maybe give you a sample of something different and you could have called us back\n\nSpeaker 2: and let us know if you have a better chance with that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's usually what patients do because we cannot anticipate if you're going to have\n\nSpeaker 2: side effect or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everybody's different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, listen, I just told you that I contacted and that doctor that's supposed to be in charge\n\nSpeaker 2: of your company sent me an email and I responded back to him and I specifically, I specified\n\nSpeaker 1: what my doctor had said and that he didn't want me taking this medication anymore and\n\nSpeaker 2: that therefore I needed to have that further shipment canceled and they continued to send\n\nSpeaker 1: it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm telling you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not my lack of not doing what I was supposed to do because I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you did.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I was mentioning as far as giving you some things that could be of better help.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have side effect, we don't have just that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have other stuff that you could have sampled for free and maybe you would be, oh, that's\n\nSpeaker 2: the one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I love that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: That one is better for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stuff of that nature.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just what I was saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't matter, but what I received, it didn't work right with me and I didn't want\n\nSpeaker 2: any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: My doctor said, you need to quit taking this stuff because I don't want you to be having\n\nSpeaker 2: any heart problems and so, okay, so I'm going to send that back and like you said, I'm going\n\nSpeaker 1: to put refused and returned.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you get your refund, okay, but I already refunded you for that last charge already,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're going to get the other $113.95 just when you start the return process, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No need to worry about.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get your money back, Mr. Vela.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: We got you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your help today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.",
