    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, good afternoon. My name is Marc Lampel. I have a question. I received the SCOREblue\n\nSpeaker 2: pills, it's 50 milligrams, and I was just wondering how does the system work? If I wanted\n\nSpeaker 1: to reorder and make a refill, do I need to let you know or how does that work?\n\nSpeaker 2: The way it works, sir, is that every order is a prescription-based order of a set refill\n\nSpeaker 1: date listed by the doctor. However, since you're calling now, you can actually modify\n\nSpeaker 2: that. Normally, what we recommend doing, if you want to have a little more control over\n\nSpeaker 1: when to receive it, we can set you to our six-month freeze plan. That way, you can always\n\nSpeaker 2: call us whenever you require them or if you want to delay it even further, and then that\n\nSpeaker 1: way you retain access to it for when you eventually need it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, but you see, I don't want them to be sent automatically.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, yeah, it won't be sent automatically. The thing is, it needs a refill date. That's\n\nSpeaker 2: the problem. Without that refill date, the prescription gets closed out and you won't\n\nSpeaker 1: be able to order anymore. But with the refill date, the prescription remains active and\n\nSpeaker 2: it gives you the option to call us in to delay it further or to get it sooner. But our best\n\nSpeaker 1: plan is usually the half-a-year plan, because that way you don't have to get it monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So right now, I'm at which plan? Automatic?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, last name is Lampel, L-A-M-P-E-L, and my zip code is 1-1-2-23.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so right now, I see the doctor sets it for every month, so I can change that right\n\nSpeaker 2: now and switch it to every six months. That way, you don't have to worry about receiving\n\nSpeaker 1: it monthly, and you can always call us to delay it further or get it sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so can you change it to six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. I can go ahead and do that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and you're all set, sir. I was able to change your plan out. At any point,\n\nSpeaker 2: call us in if you want to make further adjustments, but you're all set today, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, and then I do have a second question, if you don't mind.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so the current dose is Sildenafil Citrate. It's for 50 milligrams. Can I switch\n\nSpeaker 2: this to 100 milligrams, and if they do, would the price be the same or different?\n\nSpeaker 1: For you, since you already have the VIP active, your price will be the same. However, when\n\nSpeaker 2: you're ready to upgrade it to the 100 milligrams, just give us a call, and we'll change it for\n\nSpeaker 1: you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So wait, wait, wait. You're going so fast. Okay, so right now, there will be no doctor's\n\nSpeaker 1: fee, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll just say it one more time for you, sir. You can call us at any point to upgrade\n\nSpeaker 1: to 100 milligrams, and for you, since you already have an active prescription, we could\n\nSpeaker 2: just change it when you're ready to put a new order in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see, so not right now, the next time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, but if I don't call you, you said in six months, it will be refilled automatically,\n\nSpeaker 2: correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. They'll send you an email advising you as well, but I recommend just calling\n\nSpeaker 2: us in and getting that sorted, and then you can always...\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I want it to 100 milligrams, up it to 100, I would need to call you before the six\n\nSpeaker 2: month period ends, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, to upgrade it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and in the beginning of our conversation, you said that there was a separate number\n\nSpeaker 1: that I need to call in case I need to...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I didn't say there's a separate number, so just call us back here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a regular number that I just dialed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, well, I guess I don't have any further questions then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem. Hope you have a great day, and if anything else comes up, let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you. You too. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
