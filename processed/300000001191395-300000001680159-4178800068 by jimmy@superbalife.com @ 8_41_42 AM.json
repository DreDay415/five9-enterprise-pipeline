    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Valvozyte. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jimmy. I ordered some Valvozyte pills back on December the 5th.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you had a special of buy two, get two free. And I never have received my order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me go back and check on that for you and see what the status is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get the telephone number that you might have used when you placed your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. 417-880-0068.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's the one I was able to pull up on. I don't have anything for that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me try it another way. Can I get your first name, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Harold. H-A-R-O-L-D Luter. L-U-T-E-R. Luter.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Luter. And if you don't mind, can I also get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was 65714.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me go back and locate anything for you. Be with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Nothing's coming up on that, Mr. Luter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ask you how did you place your order when you placed it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you called in directly. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, I went to your website and ordered it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you debited $109.85 out of my checking account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No problem. I'm just trying to locate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm having a little trouble finding the actual order for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not seeing any order for you, Mr. Luter. Bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: They didn't give you an order number, did they, by chance, when you did your order on the website?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have that?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you did, it may have been on my e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: E-mail confirmation. Yeah, that's what I was going to say.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't get my e-mail. Something's wrong with it, and I can't get to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to look for the best I can right now for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your last name is L-U-T-E-R, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Zip is 65714.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I put you on a brief hold, okay? Hold on, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.",
