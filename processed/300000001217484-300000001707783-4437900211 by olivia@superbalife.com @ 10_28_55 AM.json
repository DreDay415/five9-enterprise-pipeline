    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: William Lay, LAY.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi William, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Pretty good. Um, the reason why I'm calling, I called the last time you guys sent me an order and I called the counselor.\n\nSpeaker 2: She cancelled my account. She wouldn't take any more money out of my account and you just recently took it out again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I can look into this for you. Um, what is your date of birth, William?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 29-1969.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you're located at 753 Old Donaldson Avenue, Severn, Maryland.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Um, yeah, so I do see this recent refill here. Um, yeah, I don't see any other periods of contacting us unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will say if you don't want to receive regular refills with the prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is, um, whenever you did want to order, if it was at some point before the end of July, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I called, like I said, I called last time and I talked to a gentleman and he said, okay, no problem, you know, we'll go ahead and put that in.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just noticed you took it out again, so that's why I'm calling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, um, so that product has unfortunately been shipped, so I can't stop it, but I can definitely place the prescription on hold for you so you don't get those regular, you know, monthly refills, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you need anything before the end of July, just give us a call, let us know, we're always here, Monday through Friday at least.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so is there a confirmation number or something you can give me so I can put that down so you don't take it out again?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we don't have confirmation numbers, but if you want an email confirming that the prescription is placed on hold for the next six months, I can definitely send that out.\n\nSpeaker 2: The email we have on file is chevy66 at AOL.com, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Yeah, I'll send that right over to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I hope you have a great day, William.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
