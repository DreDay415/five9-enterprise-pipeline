    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, I'm speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I see that y'all, apparently, I did not want a prescription of this Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And y'all just see, I just paid for another dose of it, and I did not want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me pull up your account one moment, am I speaking to David?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty, David, yeah, I do see one of your refills did go out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do not have to get that way, we can change it for you so you can order this differently, so you know when it's coming.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I ain't even took the first one of that first batch yet. I don't need that many.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I do understand. Well, if you'd like, we can switch it up so you can let us know when you want to receive your orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll be fine, I just don't want it automatically taking it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand. So, I mean, you can choose the day and the month, you can get it every two months, three months, four months, five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so right now, I just don't want it until I call you again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we can set it up that way too, so basically the next five months here, we'll keep your prescription open and you'll have to call us for your next one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and are y'all going to give back for that prescription there, not send it out?\n\nSpeaker 1: That has shipped already because it's coming from Kentucky. It's, yeah, closer to the end of the day over there, it's definitely been shipped out already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you won't get anything else until you call there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so you can't return that bottle?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can once you get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, stop there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, we would have to wait for you to ship it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can, but you'd have to get that back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, like I said, nothing else will come out until you are ready for it and you call and order.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many is in the bottle?\n\nSpeaker 2: Twenty-five it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Twenty-five?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, twenty-five, that's what you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the first bottle I know had twenty-five, so that's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is the AVG, the 11-minute pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, I do see that that's what you ordered, but do be advised, you know, that it's subject to people's, like, you know, body chemistry and stuff there, so, you know, it may not be exactly 11 minutes, hopefully it is, but, you know, that can change.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Like I say, I had a stroke not too long ago, so I have not took one to try it out yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, yeah, no, I understand. Well, take your time there, man, like you said, you got a couple of months to, you know, call us for your next one there, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, if I use fifty of them, I'm going to be dead anyway, so, so it'll be a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, we understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sir, we'll change it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Yeah, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
