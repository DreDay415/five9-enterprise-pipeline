    "text": "Speaker 1: Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. My name is Tadaro Christian. I have an account with Score Brew.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can help you out. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Can you just give me – how do I pronounce your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Tadaro. T-A-D-A-R-O-L.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. That's on June 10, 1954.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I was told that this was the only number that I could call in order to stop, you know, the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Okay. So, yeah, you have VIP status. You don't have to have your refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: What a lot of people like to do is go ahead and put it on a pause for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, it keeps your prescription active and allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, things over there, I'm trying to, you know, get you, you know, personal with me, but I don't use them like I used to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, my life is evolving. You know, I'm not the same person I used to be, so I'm not going to pretend.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I am getting older and all like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, I have a nice supply of backup because of what has been coming in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't even realize it until now. I almost have a whole bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you think about how many you get, what, 12 a month?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got a small bottle, almost a whole bottle. That tells you I just was shooting in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem. I'll go ahead and cancel you out. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'll get my life. You're the rest of my lifetime depending on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've got a five-year shelf life.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: There you go. Thank you. I like that. I'm going to remember that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to remember that according to your stopwatch exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. All right. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye. Thank you.",
