How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, let me start by giving you my email.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can take your first and last name please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Donald Aguilar, 914-73.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's going on Mr. Aguilar? How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when was my last time I got a refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the last time an order actually went out was way back when.\n\nSpeaker 2: You had like almost placed an order last year, but it never was approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't approved by the doctor. I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's been like years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what do I need to do for a new prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just got to pay for it. I'll get set up with the doctor today.\n\nSpeaker 1: He'll pay for it. You'll pay for it, but boom.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so is it the same? Before I used to get that 100 mg Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the same as the AGV that just came out?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's a different pill that you were taking before.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's been since 2021, it's different.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the difference with the new AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: It lasts longer and it works faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it say AGV on the pill now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not on the pill, no. It says 100 on one side and blank on the other.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: A buddy of mine, he said he ordered the AGV, and he did get the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: but he said it didn't say AGV, that he did just the regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I pay for the motor, it's going to be for the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't say AGV on it, but that doesn't mean it's not.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's about the manufacturer is the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it matters the company that makes it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The markings on the pill just designate it basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, don't worry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just like marketing on the website where it says AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so they don't say AGV on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they just have the marking.\n\nSpeaker 2: They have the milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if it's a 50 milligram, it'll say AGV on it.",
