    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I'm calling about a mistake that was made.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I got a couple of questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never, you know, authorized the order purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was looking at everything, entering my information,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I look and, you know, $94 came out of my account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I need that refunded back to my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I have a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you look at my order first?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think you want to do that, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I got Mario Escavil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you were just browsing on the website.\n\nSpeaker 1: You entered all the information.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. I put my stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was about to get it, but I think it's too expensive.\n\nSpeaker 2: That $94, what is that?\n\nSpeaker 1: What does that cover?\n\nSpeaker 2: That covers the eight pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we do have the taxes and the small pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's holding out to about $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that should have been $80 for eight pills, plus the $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's $94 to $95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to go another route, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather have that refunded back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anything I can help you maybe clear up?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it just the price?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can probably get somebody to waive the pharmacy fee for this one time,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you want to at least just try the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, let me –\n\nSpeaker 1: We also have the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you've been seeing those, or if you're just a Cialis guy in general,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the Viagra AGV is a brand-new formula that Pfizer themselves invented.\n\nSpeaker 2: It works within, like, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's more potent, and it lasts up to, like, 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know if you're looking for something to give you that kick.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how much does that cost difference between this one?\n\nSpeaker 2: About $30, actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for 10 pills, it's $49, and then with everything, it totals up to, like, $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, if you're interested, I mean, I can make that switch right here right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Honestly, that's what I thought I was going for is the AVG, not the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess I didn't answer that right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah, simple error.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's right here right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Please.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then my other thing is, how fast can I get it to come in?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I'm going out of town in, like, two days.\n\nSpeaker 1: In two days?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll pay for the extra shipment if there is one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, there's $38 for overnight, and then I can measure the –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let me get this going really fast then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Still silent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 10 pills, AVG, boom, boom, boom.\n\nSpeaker 2: You wanted 100 milligrams, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: What is that?\n\nSpeaker 1: 101.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: What I could do, you already paid the $94.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just message the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: and let them know that we have basically a full payment for overnight,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we'll have it overnighted ASAP, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that'll be awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you're not waiting for a refund or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll just be the $94.95 in total for the 10 pills and the overnight, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And make sure you get the right address.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have 3254 Tamara Drive, Apartment 1, Unit 1, Naples, Florida, 34109.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tamara is T-A-M-A-R-A, and then Drive, Apartment 1.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mario.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll have the doctor call you rather than try to message you or do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way we can get this thing going and have these pills sent out today, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you got it, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mario, have a great one, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
