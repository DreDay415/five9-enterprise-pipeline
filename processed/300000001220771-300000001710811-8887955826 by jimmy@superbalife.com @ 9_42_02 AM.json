    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jimmy. My name is Frank Evans, and I need to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Evans. Can you just give me your phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like it was transferred over to me, so I can try to help you out there. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: The phone number from which I was transferred?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. Your phone number, so I can pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my phone number. 352-237-8900.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir. Okay, I have 352-237-8900?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct? Okay, because nothing is coming up with that number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there another number you might have used?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. 352-425-1738.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Evans. I was able to find you with that one. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was able to pull up your account. I do see that you currently have a prescription with this, getting the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you're getting the 50 milligrams, and it looks like that you were getting 25 of them every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you mentioned that you wanted to cancel. Is there any particular reason why you want to cancel, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't mind at all. The only massive thing it gave me was a headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Well, we don't want that. We definitely don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me tell you what I'm going to do for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and do what you requested.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to cancel your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and stop those bimonthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're getting them every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we're going to stop those refills that was included in your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we're going to stop those on bimonthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I want to do for you, too, because you've already bought these, and you said they gave you a headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: I noticed you got the Viagra 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I get a lot of feedback from clients that take the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, it seems like the 100 milligrams, they don't have the similar side effects that the 50 milligrams give people.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what a lot of people do, if the 100 works too strong for them, they actually just break it in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they see that it works faster, it lasts longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they don't have those same side effects like the headaches or the dizziness or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I want to do for you, I want it for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to send you out 10 of these for free with no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to have you on a monthly or bimonthly subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I want to give you, like, three months to try these out, to keep your prescription on file and active with this,\n\nSpeaker 1: not out the monthly service charges or whatever the case may be.\n\nSpeaker 2: Therefore, if you do want to try these and you like these, which I know you will,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can always order these at your convenience rather than having them sent to you every other month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can guarantee you these, they're going to work better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not going to have a headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're going to see the improvement on these particular ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I go ahead and do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not charging.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want to take the chance.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I just wanted to give you an opportunity to try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: These were the new and improved Viagra pills that I wanted to send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I wanted to do it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to take care of your request and stop your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do have to tell you, though, while you're canceling this prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: that means that if you decide to change your mind and order in the future and you see that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: these are advertised and you want to try it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you wouldn't be able to because you actually are canceling the prescription that I'm trying to set you up for\n\nSpeaker 1: before it even gets started.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem there, Mr. Evans.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and take care of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and stop your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm sorry the first ones didn't work out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish you would have tried these new ones for free just to see how they would have worked out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you said you don't want to take the chance.\n\nSpeaker 2: I totally understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
