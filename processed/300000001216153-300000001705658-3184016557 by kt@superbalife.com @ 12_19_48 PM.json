    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Wesley, this is KT Goodrich again. As a veteran, I always take pride and honor in my work, bud, and serving my brothers, you know, and sisters, but let me explain to you what I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did three things for you, bud. The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, and I put a stop to any and all monthly refills, and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: I couldn't stop this one going out, but I paused your prescription, I started the credit process, so when you do receive that, like around Saturday or Monday, just circle it, the address, write refuse to sender, return to sender, refuse.\n\nSpeaker 2: This allows the process to take place. I'll give you my extension, so on Monday or Tuesday, give it around Tuesday, call me after 10 a.m. Pacific time if you can, a.m., because in the morning, a lot of people call for orders of the AGV, but just call me after, like, you know, whenever you get a chance, you know, and I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just stick with me, bud, so that way I can chase it down, and I'll do the work for you. I already started that process, but in light of this, bud, what I also wanted to say is what I did so in the future you don't get blindsided is I set up a red button on your account, so when you go to scoreblue.com and you log in with your Gmail, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You go to this category called your prescription on your phone, right, when you log in, and you're going to see a red button with white font that says quick refill. Now, anytime, anywhere, you can click that button, get a refill at your command.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only caveat to this, bud, is by law we're not authorized to send you more than one refill in a 30-day period, and then minimum two refills a year, and then you're good to go, but you can get as much as you can, as much as you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll still have a reserve for you, but send those back. We'll credit your account, and then when you're ready, you can click it again. If you need something stronger, like something more powerful to replace the other one that wasn't as good for you, let me know. When we get that money back, we'll replace those for free, too, as well, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but let's take care of each other, bud. We're not here for a long time. We're here for a good time, and we're Americans, bud. Last time I checked, you know, there's still a flag of red, white, and blue, man. It doesn't mean that it's just my world. It's our world. You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's our country, dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I'm going to give my extension, Wesley. My extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me give it a second. Let me get that going down.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and just put it in your phone later on and know that I'm your guy, dude, and I'll get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's 0037?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and Goodrich's last name, KT's first name. If anything under the sun, you call me, but I started the process already. Come Tuesday. Give it some time, bud. Let these UPS guys do their job, have faith in them, and just know that we're here for you, bud. We're Americans, all right? You're definitely not calling Venezuela. All due respect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 0037, and do me a favor, Wesley. If you don't get me because I stepped to use the restroom, because I do that often, is don't leave a voicemail. Don't waste your breath. Just leave your number with one of my colleagues, and I will call you back that day or that hour, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you leave a voicemail, then I call you back that I'm leaving a voicemail, too, and we're just chasing tells.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I'm sorry about that, bud. I didn't know that you didn't know that you're getting monthly refills by the doctor, but I set it up where I paused it. I put a stop to all those monthlies, and you're in control of that button, and as long as you do two refills a year, you're good to go, but let's get you back that money, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it, Mr. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you bet. That's how we roll, bud. Always whatever, bud, all right? You take care, and keep going, man. Keep going, okay? Don't stop, okay? Just don't stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you. You have a blessed one, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too, brother. Hey, brother, even better than that. Mark 11 24. Therefore, I say to you, my brethren, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them in Jesus' mighty name. How about that?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud. Keep going, all right? Adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
