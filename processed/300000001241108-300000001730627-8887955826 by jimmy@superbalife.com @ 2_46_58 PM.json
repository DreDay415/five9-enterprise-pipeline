    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viacra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Jimmy. I can now. Couldn't have done it first.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Jimmy. Yes, I have... You guys are still billing me on this, and I stopped it months ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull it up and see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your phone number because you was transferred over?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't mind, can I get your actual phone number and account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: 478-396-5718.\n\nSpeaker 1: One more time. Nothing came up. Can you give it to me one more time, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: 478-478-396-396.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5718.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Hooper?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got your information up here now. Let's see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I do see you're getting a Viagra, another gram, so I think you're getting 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do show a recent order that was just sent out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You say you tried to stop the order from coming out because I'm not seeing that on the account,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm going to take care of that for you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you've been with us for quite a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's going on? Is it coming too often for you, or what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it just don't work, so, I mean, there's no need.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I hate to hear you say that, but I'll tell you what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and that last order that you just got, I'm going to get you refunded for that one,\n\nSpeaker 1: since you said you already stopped it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to work with you right now, trust me.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got to get you another system, and that one's already been shipped out, by the way, just so you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: That one hasn't been shipped out, but I'm going to go ahead and take care of that,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm looking at your Visa card ending it with the number 4200.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should see a credit back on that card for the 6395.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And before we go, okay, I just submitted that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should see that within about a couple of days.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I also did, I went ahead and I stopped the automatic monthly basis refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I stopped the monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I stopped the monthly shipments, and I also stopped any future monthly charges for that Viagra 50 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I see you've been with us for quite a while, so that's been done, first of all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know what your first request hasn't taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now I want to do something else for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to give you the opportunity to try the latest and greatest new Viagra that just came out,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you said it's not working for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to charge you for these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you've made quite a few purchases in the past, which we appreciate.\n\nSpeaker 2: We want to keep you as a loyal client.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we want you to have something that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it's not working, there's no need for you to get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm going to do, I'm going to increase your dosage to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I know a lot of people that take the 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 100 seems to work so much better.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to be the new and improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be the new and improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not charging you for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing this for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm not putting you on any type of monthly refill, because I want you to try it to see how it works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you to test this out and see how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me tell you how the pill is going to look.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be a white-shaped diamond pill with the number 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the new and improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It works faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: It lasts longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it doesn't have the same side effects that people got from the other Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, I'm not going to have you set up until you get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to set up so if you like it, you can call us and order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't go online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if you go online, you're probably going to get the same stuff that you didn't want.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm just telling you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just trying to help you out here.\n\nSpeaker 2: The same number that you called?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, actually, you didn't call, and you got transferred over.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me give you a better number that you can call when you want to order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because when you try these, I'm sure you're going to want to get some more of these in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing something right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a 1-800 number.\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-0-0-4-1-9-7.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-1-9-7.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call and ask for me directly if you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's the number you want to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't go online and do your future orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to put the account set up.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you do call in an order, you're going to get what I'm sending you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So look for it in about seven days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because your other order gets shipped out on the 7th.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you got that one or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this one's going to come in about five to seven days after today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Remember, it's going to be a white-shaped diamond with the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what are the side effects?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the side effects a lot of people get are not the one I'm sending you\n\nSpeaker 1: should be none.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some of the side effects that people get on the generic Viagra, they get\n\nSpeaker 1: dizziness.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some of them get headaches.\n\nSpeaker 1: And some of them, you know, get a little stomach ache.\n\nSpeaker 2: But not everybody.\n\nSpeaker 1: But those are some of the side effects that people have complained about on\n\nSpeaker 2: the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, they get a little dizzy.\n\nSpeaker 2: They basically, you know, sometimes some of them might get a headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some of them might get a little stomach bothering.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this new and improved one got all of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, therefore, you shouldn't have that at all with these.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: What about if you get where I take heart medicine because I've gotten four\n\nSpeaker 2: stints because I had a blockage.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, as long as they won't.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because as long as you have the other ones,\n\nSpeaker 2: these are falling in the same category with your medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, they wouldn't even send it to you because your medical survey is still on\n\nSpeaker 2: file that allowed you to get these in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you should be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are actually new and improved better.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, these should be even smoother for you than the other ones that you were\n\nSpeaker 1: using.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again, my name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to reorder again, you can call and ask for me directly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you should see that difference on your card within the next few days as\n\nSpeaker 2: far as the ones that you got.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
