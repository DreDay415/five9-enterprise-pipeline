You don't want to stockpile on them, sir. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your last name and zip code? I could just pull you up in my system here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Carter, C-A-R-T-E-R, and my zip code is 78232.\n\nSpeaker 2: 78232?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, 78233.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, three. Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one moment, sir. And you said last name is Carter, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, first name James.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then real quick, sir, I do want to mention that right now you're a part of our Viagra AGV membership with Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if we were to cancel this out, you wouldn't be able to access this anymore because the doctor would delete the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, we can always switch you over to our six-month freeze plan, and you can just go ahead and call us when you need them or call us to delay it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, do it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. I'll switch you over then, sir, and you've been upgraded to that plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Aside from that, if you have any other questions down the road, let us know, but you're all set to go today. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you. You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Bye-bye.",
