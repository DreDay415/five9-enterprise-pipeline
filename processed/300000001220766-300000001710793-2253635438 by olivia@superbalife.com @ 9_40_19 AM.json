Yeah, because the thing is, if you haven't tried the product,\n\nSpeaker 2: you don't know if you need the prescription or not and you haven't even received it,\n\nSpeaker 1: which you've confirmed with me more than once. Okay, so I will figure out and yes,\n\nSpeaker 2: I will follow up with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
