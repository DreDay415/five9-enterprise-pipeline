    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at SCORE Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, how you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Danny DeFilippis.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to, I've been getting your product since 3-16-25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Danny.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can see your prescription right here, but just could you confirm your date of birth so I can talk to you about it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's March 9th, 1960.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, Danny, I see your prescription here with a 100 milligram Viagra quantity of 25 each fulfillment.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds accurate.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to see about canceling. My doctor wants me off these. I'm having my prostate removed. I gotta have surgery.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I thought when I signed up it was for three months, but apparently not.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the way the doctor set it up for refills about every three months, and that's what the schedule was set to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you're not required to do it this way. You know, it is perfectly adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 1: But just so I have notes for our doctors on my end, nothing has changed with your medications, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just you're going in to get your prostate removed. Is that it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.\n\nSpeaker 2: He prescribed me Cialis as well. And really I'm starting to stock up on these a little bit. You know, I wanted to have some backups, and believe me, I got some backups.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know, Danny, there's always another option here with you. So I see here you've taken six of your refills right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is by no means a subscription. You're not required to get these every month, or in this case, bi-monthly or tri-monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted to give yourself some time to first have the procedure, second, try the Cialis, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because, you know, after you have the procedure, two things could happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could try the Cialis and it's effective, or it's not effective, and then you want to try the Viagra again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can keep your prescription active by simply putting a pause on it, and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed later down the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that keeps you on, and it allows you, I see here you have six more refills under this script.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but can I stop?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can, but it would close out the prescription altogether.\n\nSpeaker 2: So right now, your pricing is locked in at 113.95 for a quantity of 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's because of when you signed up back in 2025.\n\nSpeaker 2: That price has substantially increased in 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: So should you come back to the Viagra AGV, you will see that price increase reflected on your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you simply pause it, you will not see that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but if I pause it, are they gonna continue taking money out of my account?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir, so your current is scheduled at every two months. Putting a pause on it would pause it all the way up until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Come August, right before August, rather, you get a confirmation email whether or not you want to extend the pause, or if you want to put a refill in, then you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: Doing this, though, just allows the prescription to remain active.\n\nSpeaker 1: So as long as you are in touch with it regarding your prescription, you'll have access to these refills later down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're not required to get them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if we pause that, I'll get an email before they send anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, and then you can check whether you do.\n\nSpeaker 1: And before they take any money out of my account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because, yeah, who knows if I'm gonna need them down the road, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just want to make sure you have access to the medication should you want it after your procedure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then if something happens, what happens if I want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can cancel at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let's put it on pause for now, and then I'll see what happens when I get the email in October.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sound like a plan?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, Danny.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and made those adjustments to your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate all your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.",
