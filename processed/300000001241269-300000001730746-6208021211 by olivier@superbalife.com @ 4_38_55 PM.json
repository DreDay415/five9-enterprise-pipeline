    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hi, my name is Paul Martin. I just want to cancel my subscription. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, let me pull the prescription here. Yeah, no worry. Mr. Paul Martin. Oh, I see\n\nSpeaker 1: that you are a VIP for Viagra 50 milligram, 22 tablets. Any health concern or you just want\n\nSpeaker 2: to take a break and reorder later? You don't want it on the monthly anymore? You want to\n\nSpeaker 1: order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll probably buy it. I will, but I only use one pill in a year\n\nSpeaker 1: and a half.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, what? In a year and a half?\n\nSpeaker 1: No way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's all I really need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow. We are really active patient here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I would offer to pause your prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: up to half a year so you can order as needed and you don't lose your price or your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can get to refill once or twice a year to keep that price. But you know, it's\n\nSpeaker 1: your call. I don't know what you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine as long as I'm automatically charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you want me to pause you for half a year so you get your refill once or twice\n\nSpeaker 2: a year?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, as long as I'm automatically charged, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the way they do,\n\nSpeaker 1: when you get paused to maintain the prescription, you get the minimum order, I think after half\n\nSpeaker 2: a year, I think it's 10 pills. And then you get another 10 half a year from that. But\n\nSpeaker 1: you don't get no monthly or large quantity or stuff of that nature.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what does that cost? Let me let me check here. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's $49. It comes to $63.95. It's\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's fine. So that's every six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect. Let me, let me set you up, which is actually really smart, because\n\nSpeaker 2: you keep the market price, basically. And you're just not on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're all set. I'll put you up for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome.",
