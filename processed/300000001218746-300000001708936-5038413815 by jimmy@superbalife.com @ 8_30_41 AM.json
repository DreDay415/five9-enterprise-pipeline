I tried your product probably about eight months ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they keep sending me more.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Let me take a look and see your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was able to pull you up with your number there, Mr. Gibson.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that you're currently getting the Viagra, the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription has you getting 40 every three months is what it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that too often for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. That's got to stop.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. We can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you like to pause the prescription for a while?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or what would you like for us to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's not working out for me that well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I don't want to keep – I mean, I've got two bottles that I haven't even opened yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wow. Okay. I can appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you said it wasn't working out for you that well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did notice that you are getting the Viagra 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go and take care of your request now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to make sure we get that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're getting 40 quantities.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's obviously way too many to be getting if you're not using.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to definitely put a halt to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to stop it from happening every three months as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I see you were getting the Viagra, the 50 milligrams, heavy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you said it wasn't working that great for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just curious what I'd like to do for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Since you said the 50 milligrams of the Viagra wasn't doing that good,\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to send you out 10 of the 100 milligrams with no charge just for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not 40 of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm not going to put you on an automatic recurring plan for this one\n\nSpeaker 1: until it's coming every month, or three months rather, in your case,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you're getting 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I just want you to try these for free\n\nSpeaker 1: or it's not working too good for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you to try something that you really might find to be something that's\n\nSpeaker 1: working for you on the house just for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to send any more of that to my house?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: The ones we're talking about, the ones you're getting?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm capped that already for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The 40, 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to try any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want to try anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: But please understand, Stacy, by us canceling your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: that means that if you do want to try it in the future, it will be a lot more,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it basically might not be able to get because we're on a first-come,\n\nSpeaker 1: first-served basis with our prescriptions and first-time orders only.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just got to tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It sounds like that's not an issue for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I do have to let you know that up front.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.",
