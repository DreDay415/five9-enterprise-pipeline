Let me try to pull up your information here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Looks like last time you placed an order was for 25 pills. Did you want to do that same thing again today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, no problem. I have you there at 330 East 2nd Avenue, North Wildwood 08260.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. I have a MasterCard here that ends in 0706. Is that okay to use today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you know what? The transaction actually declined there, Mr. Rich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which one? Why?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure. It could be just because you haven't used it with us in a while, that card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can try it again if you want, but it didn't go through on that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much are you trying to use it for?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.95. Same price as the last one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it should go through. I don't understand why it wouldn't. Yeah, I can try it again if you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. I'll give you another card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, same thing, but I can take a different card number if you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: It might just be your bank's like kind of strict right now. Maybe they have a lot of fraud going on. It's hard to say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, here's another one. It's a 5178058489357817.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ballot 530. And the CBV code?\n\nSpeaker 1: The what?\n\nSpeaker 2: The security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 302.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Give me just a sec.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you know what? That one didn't work either, Mr. Rich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't know why they're not working because they're not holding my cards. I can call my balances.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not to say that there's anything wrong with the card. The bank's probably just like got a lot of fraud alert going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes they send like text messages or if you log on to your banking app that like\n\nSpeaker 1: sometimes will let you like authorize a transaction as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted to give them a shout and give us a call back, you're more than welcome. I'm not sure why.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Well,\n\nSpeaker 2: look, it's $113, right? That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll try one more card. It'd be my third card. Now if this card doesn't work,\n\nSpeaker 2: then I don't know what the hell's the matter with your system because all my cards should work. Are you ready for this one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4 8 3 9\n\nSpeaker 1: 5 0 4 3\n\nSpeaker 2: 0 9 5 0\n\nSpeaker 1: 5 0 1 4\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration\n\nSpeaker 1: 3 26\n\nSpeaker 2: 0 3 26 and in the CVV code? 9 3 4. 9 3 4. All right, I'm gonna try this one too. Give me a sec.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nope, that one worked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unreal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unreal. Yeah, I appreciate it. That's fine. Like I said, I'm gonna look into this right now and call them\n\nSpeaker 2: and see what the hell's going on with my other two cards. Yeah, I'm sure they work.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't say like it just soft declined. Usually it's a fraud thing. They probably need you to authorize it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yep, you're all set, Mr. Rich. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Goodbye now.",
