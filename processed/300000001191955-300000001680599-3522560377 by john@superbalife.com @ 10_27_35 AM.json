    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Basset Site. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, John. I was looking at your ad for the five-month supply.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: $149. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You want to make a purchase on that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, he ain't been. He's only this $149 plus shipping or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. So, but that is correct. So, did you want to order it on the phone?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. First time ordering, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No problem. Your name, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, W-I-G-G-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Your address, please, Michael?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6168 Northwest County Road, 229 Stark, S-T-A-R-K-E, Florida, 32091.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have an email address?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's mwigs33 at yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. That's where we'll send your receipt to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, five bottles it is. Whenever you're ready, I can take your card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm driving. Let me park really quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Take your time. Let me know when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: This stuff actually works? No money-back guarantee yet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there's a 90-day money-back guarantee, and, yes, we do have success with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, we've had a lot of happy customers, but if you're not pleased with it within the first –\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd say each bottle's a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you get through two bottles and you're not seeing what you want, call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And you have to take it once a day or just as needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's two capsules that you take a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, there's 60 in a bottle. You take two a day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, God.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get my card up.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your shipping fee?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, with that – yeah, sorry. I forgot to tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I forgot to tell you that. So, with that, it comes out to $159.90 total. It's $9.95 flat-rate shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is a MasterCard.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5178-0063-6598-4071.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 2: 426.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the security code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And this is not a recurring order, sir, so you don't have to worry about getting it again if you don't order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We're all set, Michael.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I wanted to order five more bottles, I just call and do the same thing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, you can always reorder. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just letting you know it's not a subscription or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: But your order did go through, and it will ship out this week. So, you'll have it next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, sir. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too.",
