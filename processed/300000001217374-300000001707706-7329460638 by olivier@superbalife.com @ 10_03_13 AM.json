    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Vagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good morning, or good afternoon, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good morning, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: May I have the phone number linked to your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: 732-946-0638.\n\nSpeaker 1: 946-0638.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have anything under that number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe use a different one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, maybe my cell, 732-322-6052.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bingo, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've used, I guess this order was,\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered I think on the 18th,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was shipped and I was charged,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I've used it a couple of times\n\nSpeaker 1: and I've had no success whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if I can get a refund, I'd appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to try something different?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, you know, it's what I ordered,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I mean, it's interesting because I thought that\n\nSpeaker 2: when I placed the order, it was like, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: the new Viagra, but then when it came in,\n\nSpeaker 2: it was the Sinfeldel, I forget however you pronounce it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Sinfeldel, that's the main ingredient\n\nSpeaker 2: for any type of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if you didn't get the right one,\n\nSpeaker 2: do you have the pill in front of you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's, well, it's kind of, well, yeah, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the code on a pill, on a single pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the engraving?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just curious.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a, it looks like a, not a triangle,\n\nSpeaker 2: but let me just see.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, now you got the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you are trying to order the new one,\n\nSpeaker 2: this is regular Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why your order came,\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's what I see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just see regular Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, any Viagra gonna have Sidenafil,\n\nSpeaker 1: don't get me wrong, but the code that I'm telling you\n\nSpeaker 2: is the general Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I was surprised when I saw that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I've tried to use the other thing in the past\n\nSpeaker 1: and I've had no luck with that, so I figured,\n\nSpeaker 2: okay, well, let me try, you know, the new and improved,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, it says, you know, you should notice,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, in 11 minutes, you should be able to,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, have an erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I followed the instructions, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: on the, it said, you know, wait at least an hour before,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, like I said-\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, that's standard.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's standard they're gonna put down there,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I can send you a replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: because I see your order came wrong,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I can send replacement with the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: The code on the pill will be different.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're gonna say 50, that's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you get to try the right stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, hopefully that'll work, I don't know,\n\nSpeaker 1: but, you know, we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then I can send you an activator,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is a supplement to help the body\n\nSpeaker 2: kind of release blockages you may have to prevent,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you like the 50 milligram,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you know you can take up to 100 as well, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, so the activator, you're gonna get 60 capsules.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take two on an empty stomach\n\nSpeaker 1: for three, four days or five days,\n\nSpeaker 2: and on the sixth day, you can take that\n\nSpeaker 1: and take your Viagra as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can do that for a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually the good pairing, you have been helping a lot of men.\n\nSpeaker 2: Am I being charged for that or not?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, you're not charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a one-time thing, and then now,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you want to order that, you can order it on your own.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can Google it and find it maybe on Amazon\n\nSpeaker 1: or stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's a great supplement.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would recommend to, if you want to keep up with that,\n\nSpeaker 1: it could be a great help.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna try to send you a little bit of that help,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm gonna replace your order as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope we can get you in a better,\n\nSpeaker 2: better ship with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was surprised when it was shipped,\n\nSpeaker 1: and like I said, it was the Silden?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I was surprised, and it was like 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I have, in the past, I have the 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: which, like I said, it didn't do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I was really kind of surprised.\n\nSpeaker 2: I received basically the same thing that I've used\n\nSpeaker 1: in the past, and I didn't have any luck with that either.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when I saw the new AGV, whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: hopefully, maybe that will be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna send you the replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: still diamond ship, because that's the trademark for Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's gonna say 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the improved formula, AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's gonna say 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: AC340S399, that's in the regular generic,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the AGV's gonna say 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the improved formula they have been working on,\n\nSpeaker 1: and everybody is going for right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I sent, I already shipped the activator,\n\nSpeaker 2: Low Copper Business Day,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm reshipping you 10 tablets of the AGV, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you don't get in charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: You already pay for your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm trying to get you the supplement.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully, the activator can help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so yeah, you're all set for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know when you get the activator,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you get a better outcome with the different,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the one that you're getting right now\n\nSpeaker 1: is different lab, is a different formula,\n\nSpeaker 2: the VIAGRA I'm sending, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try it separately, and keep those as a backup.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't need to return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're FDA approved as well from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can keep those 10 tablets on the side, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could work with the activator, too, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your helping.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what, you can take the rest of the day off\n\nSpeaker 2: with pay, and you tell your boss\n\nSpeaker 1: that Rick said it was okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fair enough?\n\nSpeaker 2: Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
