    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, Olivia, this is Gary Burke calling. I got an order. I placed an order with you a few weeks ago, and I received it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got another order in the mail today, which I did not order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I can look into this for you. Give me just one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I need to cancel. I don't want any other orders. If I need anything else, I'll come and call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we can definitely fix you up that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me just one moment. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. I apologize about that. All right, so what is the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: 571-422-0304?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. There you are, Gary. Okay, and what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: August 17, 1951.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And you're located in Fairfax, Virginia. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you want to place it on hold today, that's totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just if you need anything before July 27 of this year, you just need to give us a call to place it on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let's do it that way. I'm not at this point, but yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to just go and cancel it out, and if I need something or something, we'll reach back out to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It is my job to let you know that we do only pay for the Dr. C. once for the initial prescription because we do offer the option to place the prescription on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and then even if July rolled around and you still had a bunch of pills or something or didn't need them,\n\nSpeaker 2: you could also let us know that you need to leave the prescription on hold because you still had pills left or you didn't need them for any specific reason.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, let's go ahead. I may not get back around in talking, reaching out back in July,\n\nSpeaker 2: so let's go ahead and close it out if you would, and I appreciate it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The last part of my job is to mention to you, and if you're into it, great, and if not, no worries,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if the prescription wasn't working for you or if the pills weren't working for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do technically qualify for a current promotional offer we're running,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is we are sending out a free sample of 10 pills of their newest, highest-quality stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes from their Pfizer labs in France, and it is their fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made,\n\nSpeaker 2: but my favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does look like you haven't tried it, and it is a superior prescription to your current one,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the way the free sample would work is the free sample is 10 pills, so I would send those out to you pending winter storm.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd usually get them by Thursday or Friday. Maybe it would be next Monday or Tuesday,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you'd have kind of like a six-month free trial, or you'd have until July to give us a call back,\n\nSpeaker 1: let us know, hey, I love these, and I ran out. You know, it's only 10 pills, so I'm ready to order,\n\nSpeaker 2: and this is how I want the script set up, or if they didn't work for you for any reason,\n\nSpeaker 1: you just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until July to let us know, hey, these pills didn't work for me,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I think that's unlikely. Based off of the reviews, which are really good, what's really common is that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: the men definitely want to order it again because it's the best Viagra on the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, if you were interested, I could send you some.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, essentially, I kind of thought that's what I was getting the first time, the way the ad went.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, these are just the ones that have the side effects and everything else to it, which I don't want to deal with.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you can go ahead and send them if you want to, and I'll try them, but that's what I thought I was getting in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no, I understand. Yeah, I mean, I am really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are a superior product. I mean, you'll notice immediately once you use them,\n\nSpeaker 2: especially if you follow the rules of taking them on an empty stomach and avoiding alcohol and caffeine when you take them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so can I ship this free sample to 4330 Cannon Ridge Court, Unit AA, Fairfax, Virginia, 22033?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, you can go ahead and send them there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So, yeah, you should receive these soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, you know, we're always here this summer, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific, even sometimes on holidays.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you need anything before July, just give us a call, and otherwise that free sample is on its way out to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but that prescription is completely placed on hold, and then your old one is no longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course. Okay, well, I hope you have a great day, Gary.\n\nSpeaker 1: You as well, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
