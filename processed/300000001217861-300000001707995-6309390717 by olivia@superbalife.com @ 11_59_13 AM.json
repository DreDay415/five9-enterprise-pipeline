    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Craig Crow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey Craig, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I canceled the prescription of these things.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got two more bottles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can look into this for you, Craig.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1-28-52.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you live at 2607 Sheehan Court, 203 Naperville, Illinois.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you should not have gotten two more bottles.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do see that on the 18th, that would have been your first refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you might have received that a few days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you don't want to receive regular refills with the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six\n\nSpeaker 1: months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would\n\nSpeaker 2: expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then whenever you are ready to order, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'd rather just cancel it, and then I'll call when I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to be moving to Europe within the year here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, like I mentioned, I can place it on hold the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you need anything before July 27th, you can write me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got like three bottles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you should only have two.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, or at least two from us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have four left, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have four here because I haven't taken them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, for pills, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, for bottles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, for glue?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got two today, and I had two in my drawer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, maybe those other two are older or from a previous prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, just let us know by the end of July if you need anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not, and whenever you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no, I don't want to call back in July.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to cancel it, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know where to find us in the future if you do need us, Craig.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I am happy for you about Europe.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your prescription is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, now do I have to pay for these?\n\nSpeaker 1: Am I getting charged for these?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you already were like a week and a half ago on the 18th.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't sign up for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's like a bad thing going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: People are saying you have a prescription when you don't have a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you placed the order online,\n\nSpeaker 2: the screen popped up right as you placed it that said.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think I did it online.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't like to do it online.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I did it over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so when you place the order over the phone,\n\nSpeaker 1: it shows the order with one of our customer service agents' names,\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's how the system is set up for when we place an order for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you place it online yourself, it shows up just as updated by customer,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is what I can see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, so when you place the order,\n\nSpeaker 2: there was a screen that popped up that said every prescription comes with\n\nSpeaker 1: three pills that the pharmacy will set up for.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you do want to change the way the pharmacy sets those up or place them on\n\nSpeaker 1: hold or cancel them, you can call this number,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it offered you this phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: And because you didn't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how much did they charge me then?\n\nSpeaker 1: The exact same as the first prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was 10 pills for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, shit.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I can't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm retired.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm an old man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm retired.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, if you want to send them back for a refund, you definitely can.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a 90-day return window.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can email you the instructions of how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Another hassle.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how much were they, a piece, $60 a piece?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: For 10 pills, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they were two orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that adds up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, send me the thing, and I'll send it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the email we have on file for you is CraigPro1994 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1994.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't hear you say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, 1994, right, at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'll send that to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, just follow those directions.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then once we receive it back, we'll be happy to refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at my, oh, here it is, $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thanks, Craig.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
