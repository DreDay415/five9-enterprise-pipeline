Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you've got two orders going on, so you want to cancel one of them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me cancel one. That simple.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I mean, anyway, you shouldn't even receive 100 pills at once also, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You shouldn't even receive 100 pills at once anyway, because both of them are for 50 each.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can't just have 50 at the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so I canceled one of the orders and you still have one order. That's correct, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you had a double order, so I canceled one of them, kept one of them. Correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Done. Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
