I didn't think I was on y'all's reoccurring refill list, but I want to be kicked off of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I get your name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ronald Griffin and 72679.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. While I pull this up, sir, do you just not want it at all, ever, or do you not want it this frequently? Because I can make it far less often.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want to keep it, but I don't need it just automatically refilled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. 888 Highway 254?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So if I do cancel it, that's fine. Just know it may be more difficult to order if you needed a refill down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You sent me two bottles and I'm not even through with the first one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Understood, sir. Just letting you know. But I've taken care of it for you. I can hear you loud and clear. You don't need more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I went on the website, but I couldn't find a deal to stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We've had issues with, and this is going to sound kind of funny, but with disgruntled partners or exes and stuff screwing with people's accounts.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've kind of had to limit some of the aspects you can do on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I've taken care of it for you, sir. You will not be billed going forward. So I hope you have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.",
