    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you doing? I just checked my bank, right,\n\nSpeaker 1: and there was a withdrawal from you guys for 169,\n\nSpeaker 2: or I guess it would be A-G-E-D.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you check that for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course I can. Yeah, of course, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did I just get your full name, sir, and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Henry Jenkins, 1-20-49.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Mr. Jenkins, I see your prescription was for the quantity of 40 of the 100 mg Viagra A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like the doctor has you on refills, and yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it looks like a refill went through on the 28th, and that's why you were charged that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a few options here, whatever you'd like to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Normally, what I recommend for patients who really don't want these to come monthly,\n\nSpeaker 2: or in their case, tri-monthly, we put an extended pause on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That allows you to kind of just call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I could adjust your prescription for any future refills to be like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're sent it out, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it has been assigned a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay, because I haven't gotten any information about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I heard that you took the money out of the bank, I went and checked my mail,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I didn't see nothing there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it hasn't arrived yet, put it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when it's getting ready to arrive, you're going to send out a tracking number for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yep, and then you'll know when to expect it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, like you said before, yeah, I would like to do that instead of just checking it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I need it, I can call you guys and, you know, kind of order it like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll put that pause under your account here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir, I went ahead and did that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, good, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Another question.\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 milligrams is the highest, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, 100 milligrams are the highest prescription medication you can get of the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, the AHGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be looking forward for that then, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
