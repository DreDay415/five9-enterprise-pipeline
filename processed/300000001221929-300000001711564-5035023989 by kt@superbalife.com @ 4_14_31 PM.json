    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Doug, I did three things for you and I just want you to keep my name and my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because there's too many fingers and hands in this cookie jar.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here's what I did, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: First things first, I made it clear, I cleared a clean slate because I put a stop to any—\n\nSpeaker 1: and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I paused your prescription and I credited you back to your account and then we can start—\n\nSpeaker 2: all over as to what you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just tell me what you want and we go from there and I can have it to you within a few—\n\nSpeaker 2: days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well I thought I was going to get, I mean, what I tried to do was just a refill—\n\nSpeaker 2: back in January 8th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, so for some odd reason, so here's the caveat to all this.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you first, when you got a refill on the 16th, legally in Oregon, we're not authorized—\n\nSpeaker 1: to send refills within a 30-day period.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you were just, the pharmacy was holding it till December 22nd.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'm going to do now, I'm going to override this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm just going to give you a refill now and I'm going to give you 40 tabs because—\n\nSpeaker 1: the volume that you're getting and it looks peculiar, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It just looks peculiar.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But don't worry, I'll make this right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 100 milligrams of the AGV, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The white diamond pill, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: The one that, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I'm going to get that to you and then moving forward, bud, just know that if you—\n\nSpeaker 1: need anything, take down my name and my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way, you never have to wait in line, don't get it passed around and I'll make it—\n\nSpeaker 1: happen for you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what was your name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: I used my initials, KT, like Kilo Tango and my last name is Goodrich, as in tire.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's your extension?\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did is I fulfilled the order to 40 tabs, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's going to come to you in the next two to three.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be there by Saturday at best.\n\nSpeaker 2: At worst, Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, at worst.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let me ask you something.\n\nSpeaker 2: How frequent do you want this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm going to set something up very special.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I, do you want it quarterly, monthly, how do you want it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, I'd probably, monthly is cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'm good with monthly, but yeah, do I have to go down in a number then?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll just do it monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So January, today's the what?\n\nSpeaker 2: The 28th?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we'll put it in February 27th, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then let me show you something, just in case there's a snafu, call me, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: But then what you do is you go to scoreblue.com and then you log in with your Gmail account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to show you what I did is I put a red button with white font that says quick—\n\nSpeaker 2: refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So anytime, even if you're traveling, so you go to Vegas, let's go to, you go to Miami—\n\nSpeaker 2: update your address, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: With your, your shipping, not your, you're not your billing with whatever hotel, wherever—\n\nSpeaker 2: you're at.\n\nSpeaker 1: Click that quick refill button, the red button with white font that says quick refill, and—\n\nSpeaker 2: we'll send it to you in two to three business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I got to log out to see that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me log out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Log out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Log in.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then go back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Log in with Google?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Log in with your Gmail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you use your browser, Google browser, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's your Gmail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm using that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're using cookies.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your cookies save everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Click on the top.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's saved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Click on which one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Underneath your, the tab there, you don't see it now because I just pressed the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: In about an hour, you'll see a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you, if you can't click that, if it's not letting you, just call me and I'll make—\n\nSpeaker 2: it happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me recap for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I went ahead and fulfilled the order of 40 tabs of the AGV 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm having it sent out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I paused your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I set you up with monthly refills on the 27th of every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, within a 30-day period, you'll get it next month again.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need time or anything else, let me know if you want to do a lateral move.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want the blue pill, if you want to pause it, just let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for calling in and thanks for letting me be of service, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, if you get a chance, bud, do me a favor as a veteran.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, these guys gave me a, you know, I was homeless during COVID and I was just—\n\nSpeaker 2: using it like I was doing my tactical training.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you can go to support, email support at scoreblue.com and just let them know how—\n\nSpeaker 2: you felt about me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm up for review, man, and any dollar would count.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: That really helped me out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Support at scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're here in L.A.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see your email.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said it's TK or?\n\nSpeaker 2: KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: KT.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm backwards.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just email Doug.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just say, tell them however you felt about this interaction, you know, organically because—\n\nSpeaker 2: any dollar would help me, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, it's not how much you make.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's how much you save, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it'll help, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: A little bit more will help, too, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I appreciate that, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Bob.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
