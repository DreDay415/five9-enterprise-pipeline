Yeah, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to get with you. Can you cancel my shipment for this one coming up?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, Mr. Powell.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to change the frequency? How often do you want it moving forward?\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably every six months would be good.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to wait six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: We were doing every three months before, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Every six months would be good, and if I need more, I'll let you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when does the next one be?\n\nSpeaker 2: So right now you were saying January.\n\nSpeaker 1: We could have put it in April, but I'm putting you either 30th of June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that fine? Or 27th of June?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 27th of June. That would be good, yes. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you all said I did it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Next date is 27th, but you can order before that if you like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give us a ring.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds great. I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set. Bye-bye.",
