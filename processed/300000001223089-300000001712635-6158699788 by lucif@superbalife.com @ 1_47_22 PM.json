    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks a lot for speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I need to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, am I speaking to Dale?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one moment, Dale, let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dale, I do see Viagra with us here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you mind if I ask why you no longer want the Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Basically, I bought a lifetime supply from you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow, yeah, I do see you did order a lot of them here.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I mean, you don't have to get any more until you're ready, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you can order this as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it looks like I'm on auto bill every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the only way that happens is if... well, no, you couldn't get that many\n\nSpeaker 1: every month anyway, so I couldn't say that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It would be illegal for the pharmacy to ship you out anymore for at least\n\nSpeaker 1: three months because of how many pills you got.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I'm on the website, it says, you know, edit frequency and edit,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you can't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was worried that I'm getting auto billed every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, so the only way that even happens is if you do not set\n\nSpeaker 2: this up when you first order it, so you can set it up to order as needed\n\nSpeaker 1: or let us know what day and month you want your orders to come out.\n\nSpeaker 2: If not, then it will go out kind of how the prescription is written,\n\nSpeaker 1: but don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I see you got a lot of pills here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you loud and clear, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, we can just keep your prescription open\n\nSpeaker 1: and let you order your next order, you know, as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good deal, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: This doesn't seem to be working real good, real well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you taking it on an empty stomach?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm taking it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had gotten some powder years ago that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: I probably had it for, I guess, 10 years, and it's worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, like I said, it's a lifetime supply almost.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, I'm running out of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I went back to where I ordered it like years ago,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they told me it's not available.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that Alibaba?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's Alibaba from China.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but that stuff, it'll work because they put so much dangerous stuff in it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, that actually gets it to work because they don't get quality product.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So they start putting all these other drugs inside of it to get the erection,\n\nSpeaker 1: but ultimately what that does is just damage everything down there\n\nSpeaker 2: and if you really do get the real stuff that's actually safe for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you feel like you're not getting the best reaction\n\nSpeaker 2: because you're not getting all this hyped up bad stuff\n\nSpeaker 1: that's like forcing an erection in you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it actually damages stuff down there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like taking something that's having your heart race, race, race, race all the time,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then ultimately, you know, your heart's got damage from, you know, doing it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same thing down there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a lot of those products that aren't FDA approved do do that to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and ultimately nothing will work unless you're taking something that could kill you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's usually what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't feel damaged.\n\nSpeaker 1: I feel pretty healthy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I live a pretty nice lifestyle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as I'm not getting billed.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as I'm not getting billed monthly, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: And by no means do I mean like not healthy,\n\nSpeaker 1: but just, you know, like the reaction that you feel like you're getting\n\nSpeaker 2: might not feel as intense because you were taking something that was a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what about this stuff that's made, you know, what about Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that different?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, we do have other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have stuff manufactured here in America,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we got some stuff that's manufactured out from Pfizer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're both Pfizer pills, but we have one that's made here and made there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, a lot of times, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: it could just be the idea of just switching over to something that maybe is\n\nSpeaker 2: manufactured different could be the difference\n\nSpeaker 1: in getting something to work a little stronger for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the powder I bought, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was advertised as 100% Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but see, Sildenafil made in India and China is where there's not very\n\nSpeaker 1: high regulatory systems for their medications.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're putting a lot of junk in it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, like America and France have, you know, actual federally, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: FDA and, you know, actual regulatory systems for their medications, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: so this stuff is actually high quality and it's actually safe.\n\nSpeaker 2: That stuff you're getting from India and China, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: they sell it for so cheap because it's made very cheap,\n\nSpeaker 2: and ultimately it's just junk.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the difference between driving a Rolls Royce and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: a little Honda or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're both cars.\n\nSpeaker 1: They both get you to a place, but one is a higher quality.\n\nSpeaker 2: What would I have to do to try Cialis from your pharmacy?\n\nSpeaker 1: We can get you to try Cialis, but do you want to try Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: or do you want to try Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you sure you want to try Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you some, but you can't really switch back and forth\n\nSpeaker 1: constantly.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I can ship you out some to try and see how you like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to try, like, one Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I do that without spending $149 with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to send you out some for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you out some 20-milligram Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is the strongest that there is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It only lets me send it in fours, so I'm going to send you about four of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this is considered basically like the weekend pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is something you can take, like, on a Friday\n\nSpeaker 2: and last you all weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But see, my problem is with this Viagra, it feels like it's, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: very, very small window of time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think you might just, what I can do instead of trying Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could just send you this other Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, honestly, it might be the chance.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could just send you 10 of them out, try these ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: It might work for you a lot better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do I do?\n\nSpeaker 1: What if it works and I've got 80 pills that don't work from you?\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll figure it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll figure something else, swap them out, something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll make sure you're happy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Send them all.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me send the 10 of the Viagra then,\n\nSpeaker 1: and try these other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: This might actually work a lot better.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then can you take down my name and extension?\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can give me a call back, sir,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can make sure that I'm helping you out\n\nSpeaker 2: and I already kind of know what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call me back after you try these out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull up my notes here while we're talking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so my name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my extension is going to be 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Quinn, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so just try them out, man, give me a call,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll pick back up from there either way it goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You are very welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.",
