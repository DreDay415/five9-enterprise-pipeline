Yes, Mr. Navarro, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I want to cancel the orders that have been coming in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a new account? Because I see the last order was in March, is that the one you were referring to, last time you received something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just received another order today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so you have another account then, you have another account, let me find you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, because I want to, oh, I didn't know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we're going to discover everything today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you just need to cancel it, that's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You just don't need it as often? Do you want to order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: Meaning I don't want to send you on 30 days but you just call to reorder, you just basically save your price, save your consultation but no refill charge every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I just, I've already sent so many I really don't need no more and they're really not working, they really don't work that good.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: This was supposed to be the Viagra AGV, yeah, and if that's what it is, it's not working so I really don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: My question is, is that your first time using, no I heard you, I heard you say you don't need it, I'm just trying to assess something, was it your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then the last time you took it prior to getting reversed, was it a long time before getting that reversed now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's been a little while before it started working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so and then did you take Cialis in the past, was Cialis a better help because the question is for men is either you're a Viagra or you're a Cialis person and you know, I'm trying to assess, maybe Viagra is not a good fit, maybe Cialis could be but if you try Cialis you say it didn't work so you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I've tried both.\n\nSpeaker 2: Both don't work?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, alright I'm going to cancel your prescription, cancel your account, be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have more help to provide at the moment because you say everything don't work so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you all set okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it sir, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.",
