    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, just one second. Let me get to a spot where I can actually hear you. Kind of, I got—\n\nSpeaker 2: A bad spot right here, but give me about two seconds here to step out. Okay. Yeah, my name—\n\nSpeaker 1: Is D Lakes and I've had an account there for, oh, it's been quite a while, maybe a year—\n\nSpeaker 2: Or so. Yeah. And so the last time I called and made an order, it was for just a single—\n\nSpeaker 1: Order. But as it turns out, I got another order in the mail and it looks like I was—\n\nSpeaker 2: Charged again. Yeah, we don't do one-time orders, sir, especially the prescription selected.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I could take a look to see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I beg to differ, sir, because I've done it before.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir, because we changed our policy. So what you've done before versus what it currently is, it's two different things. What's your last name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: My last name is like L A K E S and zip code 47374. And when I ordered those, it looks—\n\nSpeaker 1: Like you got the AGV Viagra. So those specific ones have to have a refill date or else they won't be approved on the prescription side. That's the reason why you had received one.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like two months down the road on January six, that order, if you don't want—\n\nSpeaker 1: It, you can just refuse it or send it back for the refund. The address should be on the bottle itself. But what I could do on my end, because we don't offer any type of just cancels and order as call, you can set it up for a frequency of every six months, which gives—\n\nSpeaker 2: You the option to call us to delay it further or get it sooner. I would, if I need it, I'd—\n\nSpeaker 1: Like to call and order it. I don't want to do every month because I didn't even know—\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on, I didn't even know that they were going to charge me for that. And it caused—\n\nSpeaker 1: Me a lot of problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. I just send it back for the refund. Once it gets to the pharmacy, they'll give—\n\nSpeaker 1: You that full refund back. But what I'll do on your end, because I explained like they need to have a refill date or else the prescription is deactivated and the doctor deletes the—\n\nSpeaker 2: Visit. I could set you up for half a year, for half a year from now, which is six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you could call us to delay it further or get it sooner. But that's usually the best—\n\nSpeaker 2: Alternative option for this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm just going to go ahead and hang on to these and I just wanted to make sure—\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to get charged again.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you won't. I'll go ahead and I'll freeze it up for the half a year, as I mentioned—\n\nSpeaker 2: To you. Just call us when you need them or call us to delay it even further.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. You're all set. I hope you have a good day. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
