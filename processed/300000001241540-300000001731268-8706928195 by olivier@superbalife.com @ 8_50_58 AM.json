    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Diegra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: This message has been transcribed. One moment while I notify the caller.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, how are we doing, sir? May I have the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: 870-692-8195.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have anything under that number. You may have used a different number.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. You've been sending me stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you remember the phone number you used when you opened the account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. It's the only one I've had for 30 years.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only one? Okay, so give me your first name and last name then.\n\nSpeaker 2: John Nicholson.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you spell that N-I-C-H-O-L-S-O-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like Jack Nicholson?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your zip code, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: 71602.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're in Arkansas?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, I see you have a prescription for Viagra, 50 mg, 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I think the doctor wrote it with refills, I think, every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you, Mr. Nicholson?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want it cancelled. Y'all are sending it to me every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't really want that. I just wanted to try it, and it's not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it's not working?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you don't have to get it every 30 days anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could pause it and just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you say it doesn't work. That's your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't mind me asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: First time, okay. So it could be that Viagra is not necessary for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I can do for you, Mr. Nicholson, I can cancel the Viagra prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: or send you a different version of the Viagra if you want to stick with it\n\nSpeaker 2: for free to try and stop anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to stop the monthly anyway because I want you to try and see if it works first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or I can get you a sample of Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now, if it works, you can call and confirm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got better luck with that, and we can talk about future accommodation.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for now, I can pause your account so there is no charge or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can try something different and see if that can be better.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you won't just pause my account and then pick it back up in 30 days?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, not at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: There is no more 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is no more 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want 30 days, initial 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your account is paused for you to reorder up to half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: And before that, either I send you a different version of the Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: or I send you Cialis to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's free, just samples to see if you can get better luck.\n\nSpeaker 1: But did you have any type of reaction to the Viagra or no?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not at all, and that was your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I want you to try something different because Viagra works the way it worked before.\n\nSpeaker 2: For men, it's either Viagra or Cialis, one or the other.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the only difference with Cialis is that it works a little bit with prostate\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can get it on a daily.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get it as you go, like the Viagra, when you want to perform,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you can get it on a daily as a supplement.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you have those two options.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'm going to do, I'm going to cancel the Viagra prescription here for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to have the doctor writing a new one so I can send you\n\nSpeaker 2: four pills of Cialis to try, and I'm going to pause the account\n\nSpeaker 1: so you don't get anything on a monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if Cialis works, you can call me and be like,\n\nSpeaker 1: oh, okay, that was a better help.\n\nSpeaker 2: But even if Cialis works, you don't need to get it every single month.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not required.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can get it every 90 days, every once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to do it every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was just the initial writing from the doctor, assuming that you're active.\n\nSpeaker 2: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to cancel it for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you Cialis, some Cialis to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope we can have better luck for you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to get you the 20 milligram, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the 20 milligram is the maximum dosage for Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a little different than Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get it, cut half and try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then take the other half.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically, you introduce your body to the medicine.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then after that, two, three days, if you want to perform again,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can take a full one, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now...\n\nSpeaker 2: You take it every day, or just take it before?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, this one is before.\n\nSpeaker 2: This one is before.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to try with the before, because we want to see if that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we're going to see if you get a little bit of a kick or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if that one is good, because he has the daily option,\n\nSpeaker 2: when you call back, we can see if you want to stick with the one\n\nSpeaker 1: that you take before, or you want to take it every day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for now, I'm going to send you the maximum dosage for this one,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is 20 milligram, that you take when you went before, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: So cut it half, try it, half pill, and then get the other half\n\nSpeaker 1: to see how you react.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then after that, you can take the full pill later on another day as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the first day, do half, and get another half, and just observe.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then two, three days later, get the full half, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then now, if you get a little kick,\n\nSpeaker 1: we know that one is a little better for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can get you on a daily, which is 2.5 milligram or 5 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way, it can build up in your system, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can get an erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have more options with this one as far as the daily or the one before sex, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now, yeah, I'm going to send you that sample here,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm going to pause your prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Cialis prescription, but the Viagra will be cancelled.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be the Cialis, because obviously, doctor got to write a new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: We cannot give you Cialis with Viagra prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to write a new one, and I'm going to pause it for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can read it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but call us back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know if the Cialis helps, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so you're all set for now, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome, and call us back.",
