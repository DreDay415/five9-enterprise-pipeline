    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I get your telephone number? It looks like it was transferred over to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to help you out there?\n\nSpeaker 1: My telephone number is 706-726-8387.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me see if I can pull you up with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is this Mr. Coleman I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Coleman. I do have you up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I do see that you're currently getting the Viagra 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you're getting 25 of them every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any particular reason why you want to cancel? If you don't mind me asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you said it's not working for you. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I just did for you, I went ahead and I stopped that bimonthly prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I also stopped the bimonthly refills that was included in that prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I stopped those bimonthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, when you say it wasn't working, I feel bad because I don't want you to say that the product that you ordered didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll tell you what I want to do for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to send you and put you on any prescription, but I want to send you out 10 of the new Viagras that just came out just recently.\n\nSpeaker 2: These are the new best ones just for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm okay. I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to try anything else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Because, like I said, again, these are the new and improved ones that are better than even the new ones that just recently came out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we're getting the feedback that they work better than any medication that's out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want to just give you a chance to try them for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, again, by us totally canceling out your prescription, that means that it will be difficult for you to order in the future once you realize that the ones I was trying to see could be available for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll go ahead and take care of your request and cancel you out since we are the only FDA-approved Viagra sales places in the world.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hate to see you lose you just because you didn't want to try the new ones that I'm trying to offer to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to go ahead and stop taking your request. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. It's been done. Just take care. All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You too. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. All right. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye.",
