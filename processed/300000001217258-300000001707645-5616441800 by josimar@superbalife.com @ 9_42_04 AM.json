I ordered a prescription from you guys, and I thought that I was getting the one with the new one that would be AGV, but the pills that came don't, they don't say any, you know, they don't say AGV on them. Is it, can you check on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's not going to say AGV on the pill, but it'll say a certain marking. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Londo, L-A-G-O, 3-3-4-3-5. Hey, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your, what does the engraving on the pill say on the one that you received?\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, I don't have it with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, if you could just verify the details on there whenever you get the chance to call us back, because if it says 5-0 on there, that's the correct pill. But if it says anything else on there except 5-0, yeah, you got the wrong one, and call us back and we'll get you a new order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem. If you have any questions, though, let us know. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
