    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Livia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure for speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: David Darley.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi David, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, thank you so much for asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today, David?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I was wanting to cancel my prescription of the score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what is your date of birth, David?\n\nSpeaker 2: 8-15-61.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 14530 Duane Court, Spring Hill, Florida, 34610?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, yeah, so I do see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, David, well just so you know, you do not have to receive those regular monthly\n\nSpeaker 1: refills with your prescription if you don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just\n\nSpeaker 1: because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it, and the\n\nSpeaker 2: way that would work is if you did want to order before then you could, you'd just have\n\nSpeaker 1: to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I just go ahead and cancel the thing now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you did cancel the prescription, you just would no longer have access to it\n\nSpeaker 2: at all, and the thing is, we do have a policy where we only pay for the doctor's visit one\n\nSpeaker 1: time for the initial prescription because we do offer the option to place it on hold\n\nSpeaker 2: for an extended period of time, so that just means you would no longer have access to it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and even if you did come back to order it, you'd have to pay for the full doctor's visit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still want to cancel, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not that great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't get to use them that much, so I've got plenty if you get my drift.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, the last part of my job is just to let you know, because you do qualify for it, that\n\nSpeaker 1: if the pills weren't working for you, you do qualify for a free sample of our newest product.\n\nSpeaker 2: The free sample is 10 pills, and it comes with a five-month free trial, and the way it works is\n\nSpeaker 1: the 10 pills I would send you, they are our newest product.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're our fastest-acting, longest-lasting Viagra, and they come directly from our Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 1: labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are, like I mentioned, they're fastest-acting and longest-lasting, but my favorite thing about\n\nSpeaker 1: them is we've specifically formulated them to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and\n\nSpeaker 2: headache, but if you did want to try them, the way it would work is I would send you the 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you'd have until June to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer\n\nSpeaker 2: them to your old scripts. We believe that you would, and we believe that you'd give us a call\n\nSpeaker 1: before then, because you'd run out, to place an order, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if not, and they didn't work for you, you'd know pretty quickly. You could always give us a\n\nSpeaker 1: call and let us know, and obviously you wouldn't need that prescription. But yeah, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2: they are a great product, but more importantly, they're a superior product to your current\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll give them a try. I've got five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, the way you want to think about it is it's like the old prescription is canceled out with the\n\nSpeaker 1: new one that has started with a free sample. Can I ship it to 14530 Duane Court, Spring Hill,\n\nSpeaker 2: Florida 34610?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send these to you at 50 milligrams, because that's what you've already been approved for, and you'll probably receive them\n\nSpeaker 2: like maybe next Monday or Tuesday. This winter storm is crazy, so it might take a\n\nSpeaker 1: tiny bit longer. And then yeah, if you need anything before June, we're always here. Just\n\nSpeaker 2: let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the final thing I want to remind you of is you want to make sure, David,\n\nSpeaker 2: that you're taking these on an empty stomach. So you don't want to eat with them, and then you want\n\nSpeaker 1: to avoid alcohol and caffeine when you take them, just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood\n\nSpeaker 2: flow, alcohol more so. And you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you love these, and I think you will. And you know where to find us. We're always\n\nSpeaker 2: at this phone number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye.",
