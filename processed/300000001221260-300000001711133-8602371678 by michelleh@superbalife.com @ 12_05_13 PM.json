    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hi. Hold on one second. My alarm's going off on my phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be hard to get a call quickly.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I placed an order on the 18th for Viagra AGV 20 pills, 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I did an add-on for another $30 for 10 extra pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I received my order yesterday, but it was missing the 10 extra pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I only got the 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Stan, let me help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's October 28, 1971.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much to your VIPCI's customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you bought a quantity of 10 for $63.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you added an additional 10 for $29.40 for a total quantity of 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got the receipt for you guys, and it says I bought 20 pills for $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how I got up to $63.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so a quantity of 10 pills is $49,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why a quantity of 10 comes out to $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the quantity is supposed to be 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have the receipt from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't sell them in a quantity of 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: We sell them in a quantity of 25 for $99,\n\nSpeaker 2: and with the pharmacy fee, it comes out to $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so I get the receipt right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says right here, 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 20 total.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, that's weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's very expensive now.\n\nSpeaker 2: See, I thought it was 20 pills for the 64.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we have 25 for $99, and then 40 for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Another question I got from you, because I kind of looked up the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It said it was like a Google lens on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it says it's just regular acetaminophen, and you guys are advertising that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have them on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, because it might be generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: They might have messed up the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me read the notes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They did.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just sent you regular generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: They did not send you the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm glad you mentioned that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out of replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we can pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can pause them for, like, three to six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to see how they are, because I've never tried them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know before you send anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll pause you until April 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then I put the order in, so they'll be shipping out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get this new bottle, on the bottle it's going to say AGB,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted on the pill is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: because right now your bottle says APCO, and then your pill says AC390 or 340 on there or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, those are just generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes the pharmacy runs out of generic, I mean the AGB, and they don't tell us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they send generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: It creates problems, so we've got to fix that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I pause you until April 1st.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, you're not going to be charged, because you received the wrong medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, awesome. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you got an extra five.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem, Stan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
