Kristen Richard in Brentwood, California.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. It does look like you are a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you just not need the pills every single month and need to pause for a while?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I actually do not like the side effects, to be honest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Were you getting like bad headaches, upset stomach?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was – it was just – I don't know. It was like an overall feeling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I just – my mood changed, like everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I just – I don't know. It seemed almost kind of pointless.\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried it like a handful of times, and it was like the same result every single time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Interesting. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I even attempted to split the pill to try to see if maybe the – maybe too much,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I still got the same effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Okay. So we are with Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's always very disappointing when our product isn't taking a positive effect on anybody.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do have a AGV version that's made in our France factory,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I don't know if you're still willing to see if we can provide anything\n\nSpeaker 1: to give you that kick that you're looking for.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you'd like, I can message my pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: and have them send you a sample of that version that I just mentioned completely for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if this one has a better effect for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: just call us back and let us know how we can accommodate with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't mind trying it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just don't want to pay another fee for something I'm definitely not going to like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once I'm finished with this phone call, I'm going to throw away the other ones\n\nSpeaker 1: because I just don't want them laying around.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to destroy them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll make sure that we don't try to charge you or send you anything for the next –\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you five months to try them and then call us back between now and then\n\nSpeaker 1: and then work on a refill schedule that fits the bill for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll message the pharmacy right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill that you're looking for will have the number 100 pressed onto it like a stamp.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you're able to tell the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you ever need me again, my extension is 0040, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0040?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so 0040?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, just like Bond.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a good rest of your day, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
