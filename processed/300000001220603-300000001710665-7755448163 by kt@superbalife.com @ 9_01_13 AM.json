    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Mark, I made it pretty quick, but so I did exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is K.T. Goodrich and as a veteran I take a lot of pride and honor in my work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did, I did three things.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, then I overrode the system and I sent an email\n\nSpeaker 1: on your behalf and our behalf to put a stop to any and all monthly refills to Dr. Scott\n\nSpeaker 2: Sanderson.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I also put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I paused your prescription and\n\nSpeaker 2: I set it up for you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you go to Charter, when you go to scoreblue.com on your phone sometime in the\n\nSpeaker 2: future, log in with your charter.net, go to a category that says your prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then there's a button that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can get it any time you want and then we can go from, you know, you have\n\nSpeaker 1: more control on autonomy and you don't get blindsided.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you know what I noticed, bud, is you've been getting this AGs of Viagra but when people\n\nSpeaker 1: get this amount and they haven't called earlier, it's no longer working for you, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like within a three to four hour period?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't, I haven't needed it so I don't use it and it keeps coming each month and I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: spending this money for nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just hold on to what you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you ever need anything stronger or less potent, call me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send replacers within 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: But use that red button and my extension is 0037 and my name is KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me for anything you need but when you go to your prescription, there's that red\n\nSpeaker 1: button.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even when you're traveling, you forget your batches or your prescription, click that button,\n\nSpeaker 1: just update your shipping address and we'll send it to your hotel room, right bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just let me know how I can be of help, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not getting any more charges or subscription, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: There is no subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: What it was was Dr. Scott Sanderson.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a normal, for this guy, I've seen this guy before, he ordered the pharmacy to send\n\nSpeaker 1: you refills on his behalf so the next time you need something, I'll even bill this guy\n\nSpeaker 2: the next time so he can eat it or I'll switch the doctor out.\n\nSpeaker 1: When someone like you gets these and you didn't know about it, it's usually the doctors, their\n\nSpeaker 2: standard practice but I took care of it where I put a stop to any monthly refills, I put\n\nSpeaker 1: a stop to any monthly shipments and I put a stop to any monthly charges and I pause\n\nSpeaker 2: your prescription and I put you in total control.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only caveat to this, Mark, is when you click that button, we're not allowed legally\n\nSpeaker 2: in your state to send you more than one refill per month, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's illegally, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So as long as you click it whenever you want, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just can't get more than one refill, 10 fills per month and then-\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't want any, zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you have a lot there and if you need them, just click that button, you'll be good\n\nSpeaker 1: to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not getting charged anymore and I'm not getting any more refills, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want any more refills, I completely understand, you can just click that button\n\nSpeaker 2: but on this prescription, just to be clear, on this actual prescription, the minimum refills\n\nSpeaker 1: that you would have to receive is two refills when you click that button per year sometime\n\nSpeaker 2: next year but if you don't want any at all, I'm going to have to delete and cancel the\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription which means cancels the entire thing in the future, let's say when you circle\n\nSpeaker 2: back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so if I cancel this prescription, if you call them back, you won't have access\n\nSpeaker 1: to the same AGV but call me at 0037 should you have a change of heart and I'll take care\n\nSpeaker 2: of that, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But cancel it all.\n\nSpeaker 1: No more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm going to do that now and you can go into the dashboard, you can see that that\n\nSpeaker 1: reflects, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll be good to go, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it all stops, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm so sorry to see you go, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was the deciding factor besides getting blindsided?\n\nSpeaker 2: Was there any other reason?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't, you know, I was injured for a bit and then I'm not, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So sorry, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you get better, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Speedy recovery.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to make sure cancel, cancel, cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: It all stops, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to that, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so sorry to hear you go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I hope you get better, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.",
