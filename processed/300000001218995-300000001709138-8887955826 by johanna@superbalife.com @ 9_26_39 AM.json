    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Joanna speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, my name is Anthony McKee.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have my prescription, and it's working so well\n\nSpeaker 1: for the School of Blue, the Sidenafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: that I want a Council B subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, can I get the phone number associated with your account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, certainly.\n\nSpeaker 1: 562-756-9128.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, 562-756-9128?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing came up under that number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could it be under a different number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me try this.\n\nSpeaker 1: I may have used, that's my mobile.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you see a 424-265-9401?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and can you confirm your name and date of birth,\n\nSpeaker 2: please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Certainly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anthony McKee, 1-9-5-6.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, thank you, Mr. McKee.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have your account pulled up here,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do you happen to have the Viagra with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you be able to read to me what it says on the tablet\n\nSpeaker 2: so I can ensure that you actually did, in fact,\n\nSpeaker 1: get the HEV?\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm looking at, let me, it's white,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's not quite a rectangle.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just says it's white, and I think it has 5-0 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's got a little angular shape.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I need to know the imprint on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says 5-0 on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is the AGV, and you've been taking it on an empty stomach?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, because it'll work best if you take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also see that you're taking 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you tried taking two at a time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you can take up to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I've never tried that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: You didn't have any side effects or anything with the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you get good results from it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's great.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted you to know that as a VIP customer,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're not a subscription like many other competitors\n\nSpeaker 1: out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're actually FDA approved, and we're a telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the doctor writes the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: and makes it available with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then as our customer, you can\n\nSpeaker 2: determine the frequency and quantity of your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can set it up however you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have monthly fees.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can also pause your account at any time\n\nSpeaker 2: for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you can retain your VIP pricing at the special rate\n\nSpeaker 2: that you have, as well as keep your prescription active\n\nSpeaker 1: and available with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I cancel out your account completely today,\n\nSpeaker 1: it will cancel that refill available to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So should you wish to call in a few months\n\nSpeaker 1: to place a future order, we won't\n\nSpeaker 2: be able to fulfill that order with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So did you want me to modify the frequency\n\nSpeaker 2: or place it on a hold?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let me make sure I understand you clearly.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we put it on pause, I'm not going to be billed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: I am correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be on a pause until July, and then I\n\nSpeaker 2: would give you my extension number.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you don't have to wait in the queue.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just call me directly.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to place an order before then,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if you want to extend that hold on your account\n\nSpeaker 1: an additional six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, the pause is fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And may I have your name and extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Joanna, and my extension is 0024.\n\nSpeaker 1: Joanna, 0024.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, are you going to, is this just verbal, Joanna?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I receive something via email?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can get something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your account will be on a hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you and I have discussed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's on the recorded line.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll leave a note on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be able, you can access this online\n\nSpeaker 2: if you want to see that your next order won't\n\nSpeaker 1: be until July, unless, of course,\n\nSpeaker 2: you call in before then to place an order or extend that hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what is the site online that I would go to to see that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you email that information?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm at work, and I need to turn it on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, are you amckee750 at Gmail?\n\nSpeaker 1: I sure am, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'll send that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a audience token.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just sent you to your email a link\n\nSpeaker 2: where you'll be able to set up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, listen, thank you for the clarification.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got a call coming through, and I have to take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for calling and being a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
