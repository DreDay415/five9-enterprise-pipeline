So what is the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Can you say it again?\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, so what is the phone number associated with your prescription because it looks like it's not this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yep.

Why are you doing that to access somebody else's medical information?\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean by this?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's illegal. Why are you trying to look into somebody else's HIPAA-protected legal medical information?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Are you going to help me or not?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you're a liar because you're not James Jenkins, so why should I allow you to look into HIPAA-protected medical information?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I don't want to waste my time here, okay? I'm trying to ask that. Can you help me or not regarding this?\n\nSpeaker 2: None of us will be willing to help you, and we'll make sure that you're not able to access us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.",
