    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I have a charge on my net spend card that I never told anybody they could charge anything on my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it came out of my benefits card, and that's the only money that I have.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm trying to figure out how I can get a refund on this because I haven't even ordered anything from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do you have a phone number that we might have on file?\n\nSpeaker 1: But you said you've never ordered anything from us ever?\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope. I've never ordered anything from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Then I don't know how you would have got charged anything from us then.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what's your telephone number? Let me see if I can locate your phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 830-328-0273. And if it's not that one, this is 830-460-1779.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And what's your name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: James Peavey or Aaron Peavey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Aaron Peavey. Okay. I do have your account, Aaron Peavey. I do see that you have ordered from us in the past.\n\nSpeaker 1: You actually ordered back in October. The Viagra is 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got 40 of them, and your prescription had them come out to you every three months, it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I've never gotten anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It shows that the first one was delivered to – can you confirm your address with me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I can tell you where it was sent to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's 110 West Ranch Road.\n\nSpeaker 1: Number 57, number 10 at Leakey, Texas, 78873.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where that first order was shipped to, and it shows it was delivered.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's where this order was going to, that same 110 W Ranch Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I ordered was one month of that stuff, and that was it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No, unfortunately, the doctor that did your prescription, they set you up for every three-month prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what the prescription did.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what the doctor – so that's what that order was for every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if that's too frequent for you, you don't have to get them every three months or whatever the case may be.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's what the order was, and that's what was just recently charged to your account for that prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: that was set up to get them every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I never even got the stuff either.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they just sent that on the 26th.\n\nSpeaker 1: It usually takes about five to seven business days for you to get them.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they wouldn't have came that fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: They still probably – and I can see they were shipped, so the tracking –\n\nSpeaker 2: I can check the tracking for you to let you know when they get there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any possible way that we can cancel the order?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I could probably suck this one up and just go ahead and keep it when it gets here,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can actually return them if you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just put – return the sender, and I recommend you get a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's scheduled to come out – expected delivery is Saturday, January the 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what the tracking number is saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as I mentioned, again, your prescription did have you scheduled to get them every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is three months too frequently for you, or are you not using the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I wasn't even going to order them then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't even realize that I ordered them then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it was definitely a prescription that was set up for you for every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you haven't used them at all, basically, from the first one?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're not using them at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, we'll go ahead and take care of your request and cancel your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if we do cancel your prescription, that means you wouldn't be able to order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't know what you think we didn't mean to you in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I totally understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go ahead and take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll cancel any future prescriptions for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a great day there.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: See, they don't tell you that, believe me.",
