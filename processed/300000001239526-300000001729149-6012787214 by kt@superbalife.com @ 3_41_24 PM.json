    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Joel, this is K.T. Goodrich from Pfizer, score blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to use your telephone number to 601 to pull up your account, just bear with me, bud, so I can read off your chart, so I can help you put a stop to this, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just correct me if I'm wrong, that way I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you were working with Dr. Paul Drummerbrin, he's one of our Pfizer doctors, and it looks like he set you up as a VIP, and he wrote a script for 100 milligrams of the white diamond pill that we make in our Pfizer labs in France, it's the FDA approved Pfizer vaccine.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I do see what you're saying is, Dr. Paul Drummerbrin ordered the pharmacy to send you refills on a monthly basis, you want me to put a stop to that so you don't get them monthly anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been stopped at, and I tried, I called my bank, and I told them that do not allow you all to do it, I said, once I called y'all, and I told them on the messaging thing that came from it, I texted and I said, I do not want that anymore, it does not work right and everything, at least it don't work right with me, and I didn't want it, and so my credit card, my bank told me that that was, they had already sent it and everything, and if they try to send it again, we'll catch it and everything, and make sure I contact you all again, and I did, and then they took it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, so Cecil, I completely, but that really grinds my gears for three reasons.\n\nSpeaker 2: One, it didn't work for you, and that's okay, if it didn't work for you, that's okay, because everyone's physiology is different, and you need something stronger, and that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the second thing is the doctor didn't contact you and say, hey, Joel, how's these things going, you know, how are they doing, are they going good and all that, thumbs up, thumbs down, do you want a refill?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that one, they sent another refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now let me put you on a brief hold so I can get in front of this, and put a stop to it, and I'll take care of you, and then I'll explain everything, bud, that way we can be on the right path, and we're Americans, we've got to look out for each other, right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course, Joel, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, bud, that's how we roll, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know about everyone else, but here at SCORE Blue Pfizer, and as a veteran, bud, we bleed red, white, and blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just hold on here, and that damn bastard doctor, man, I'll give him a piece of my mind.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I'm law enforcement as well, too, so yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you know what we need?\n\nSpeaker 2: Guys like that that our doctors is using their power, we should set them up from afar, load up that AR-15.\n\nSpeaker 1: You already know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're so crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because he never told me, to me, to do it properly, you should say, Joe, and we're going to give you a trial, and you tell us how you like it, and we need to tweak it, and we need to whatever, but if it's not right with you, we can do this, but he definitely, if he didn't tell me anything, he should have told me that they're going to keep on taking it out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't open it up like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I opened it up for you to take this, as he said, a one-time payment, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't agree to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I complete.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what, Joe, I'll handle this, bud, and as a veteran, I'll make sure after we get off the call to make you whole, and I'll give you my extension so you can always deal with me, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Standby, Sarge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Standby, Sarge.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: And thank you for your service in blue, because my family bleeds blue, too, but my brother-in-law is a federal marshal in Guam, and he's been doing it for about 30 years, so he was out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: He did a, what did he do, an air marshal?\n\nSpeaker 2: Then he did the marshal, a federal marshal, so I appreciate you guys, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys, without you guys, you know, I don't know how the hell this, I don't know how they try to, in certain states, cancel police officers.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do they do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do they try to do that in America?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, and we, as in law enforcement, we hold a duty to the civilian.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uphold the truth.\n\nSpeaker 1: You swear in.\n\nSpeaker 2: We really do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you uphold the truth.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we don't, we're not supposed to do, you know, use our power against somebody, because if we do, then we need to be put to the same rules and regulations and everything, because we're not above the law.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're just the law, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Amen.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I tell everybody, I tell anybody, you know, just because I have this, and you tell me,\n\nSpeaker 2: appreciate your services, and I tell them, I say, I tell people like this, I say, I say,\n\nSpeaker 1: and whatever you do for a living, I appreciate you, because everybody has a job in this world,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we're all important.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Amen, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amen, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, you and I, man, we come from the same cloth, bud, and you know, they're seeing things.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know how calm and stoic you are?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's because you know what you can do, but also you've seen the evil and the devil.\n\nSpeaker 1: You look them in the eye and you shut them down, but you know that you possess this power and authority, but you don't need to flex.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't need to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me handle this, bud, and let me serve the blue, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stand strong, stay hold, and I'll serve you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stand by.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?",
