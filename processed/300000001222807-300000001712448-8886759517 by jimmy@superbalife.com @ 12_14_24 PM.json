    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jimmy, this is Wayne Stowe, sir. How are you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing good, Wayne. Can you do me a favor, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you give me your telephone number? Because it looks like you got transferred over to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I did. 6-678-858-6043.\n\nSpeaker 2: Albert Wayne. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. I do have you up. Sorry, Albert W. Stowe. S-T-O-W-E. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered your medicine in December. I got my order. I just got a resale today that I did not reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at your account, Wayne. I do see that the pharmacy, when you first set up, the doctor gave you a prescription that puts you down for 10 pills every month of the AGB Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're getting the good stuff, but they have you set up for every month. Is that too frequently for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: If it is, we don't have to get it every month. We can push that out or postpone it so you don't have to get it so often.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Wayne, you say my pills are supposed to have AGB wrote on them?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they have the number 1-0-0 on the back. The 1-0-0 on the back, that's letting you know that it's the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, okay. Well, I don't remember in the conversation I had with that person about getting one a month. I don't remember that. I promise.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm 73 years old. I can't afford that every month. Please take me off of the roll.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can appreciate that being too often, but to keep your prescription on file, we can set that up so you only get it like twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. I don't want nobody to be able to charge my account because I don't have $900 a month and they just took $40-something more out, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And on the 22nd, that's when the next order was filled for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: On January 22nd, but if every month is too frequently, like I said, we can pause it to every 6 months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, sir, sir, please, please. You said that and I heard you. I'm asking you. I didn't order this.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said I signed up for 10. I don't remember that. I wouldn't have done it if I'd known they were going to give me every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So can you refund this? I paid for the first one, but you charged me this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please, can you help me take my name off the roll and refund my money?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, all you have to do is just return the other ones back to us and we would be more than happy to refund you because we do offer a guarantee on the product if you want to refund it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you just send it back to us and we will refund it and I will stop the future shipments from coming out to you so you won't get any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: But realize by taking it off of your prescription, by canceling it, you wouldn't be able to order in the future because you're not on a prescription with us. It will be removed.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that, sir. I understand that. How much did you charge me this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was $40.29 on the 22nd.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, God. Oh, God.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, just take my prescription off.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to cost me $10 to ship this back to you and have to wait for my money another 25 or 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that my problem?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to take care of you. Not a problem. Give me one second. I'm going to go ahead and get that issued for you because I can hear the stress in your voice and I don't want you stressing out over your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm telling you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you. Okay. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to pull up your account with the phone number. I mean to refund you and I'm going to do that for you right now. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're so kind. You'd like to make my blood test again.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want you to leave us on a bad note or anything like that, but I understand what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I tried this one pill two days after I got it and it never worked for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's interesting because you are getting one of the best pills out there. You are getting what looks like the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's good. Maybe one day I'll get a chance to try it again, but as long as my heart stays as good as it is now, if you're going to give me my money back because it cost me $10 to ship it back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. I totally get your scenario of what you're saying, so bear with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: You had a lot of success with this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, big time. Unfortunately, like I said again, we're canceling you out so you wouldn't be able to order in the future, but a lot of people are ordering like crazy and they're happy to get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I went ahead and took care of that. I stopped all your future shipments and I got you your refund, so you don't have to worry about that. You should see it on your credit card back in like two or three days. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, can I write your name down for reference because my mind ain't good as it used to be.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, my name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and like I said again, you've been taking care of my order.\n\nSpeaker 1: You give me a confirmation number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the order number that was refunded. Are you ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: F as in Frank, 673, A as in Apple, C as in Charlie,\n\nSpeaker 1: the number 8, 2, A as in Apple, and the number 3.\n\nSpeaker 2: F673AC82A3.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct. That's the confirmation that you got.\n\nSpeaker 2: Jimmy, I can't thank you enough, buddy. I can't thank you enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I won't have no more. Thank you, brother. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
