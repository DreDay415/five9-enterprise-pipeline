Yes, hi.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to cancel my prescription, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I have Glendon Disharoon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: In Key West, Florida. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Glendon. It does look like you are a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you overstocked right now and just need to pump the brakes for a while?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I just need to cancel it. I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Were the pills just not a fit for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know, it's okay. It's just I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just kind of, you know, I guess I'm just backing off and I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Everything has been canceled. Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Bye-bye.",
