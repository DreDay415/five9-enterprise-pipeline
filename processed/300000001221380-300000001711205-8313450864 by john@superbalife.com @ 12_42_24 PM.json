I need your name and zip code to start.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Barry, B-A-R-R-Y, Burt, B-U-R-T, and my zip code is 95003.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you sir. You have the pills with you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you mind just, so I can confirm over the phone, just read to me what's stamped on an actual pill, just one of the tablets?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, I'm curious to see, hang on just a sec.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you're on Lupine Valley Road right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe it says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you know, you're right, we did send the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell both the regular generic Viagra and then the AGB, so there must have been a mix up somewhere along the way,\n\nSpeaker 1: either in the transmitting to the pharmacy or at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do apologize. Those are safe, so if you did take one, you're not going to be harmed in any way.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to get you 20 of the AGB ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know how I knew that that was wrong, is the AGB pill would say 50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not only should the bottle say AGB on it, but the pill for sure would have said 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and also the bottle says take one out one hour before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and good point there.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGB bottle is going to say the same thing, and that's not because it doesn't work faster,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's because we can't promise the exact speed for every single person that takes it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So to avoid having our customers be in an embarrassing situation the first time or two,\n\nSpeaker 1: we do say take it an hour before.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would say commonly though I hear it works in about 15 to 20 minutes for most people.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, do you have all my contact information?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 440 Lupine Valley Road in California here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then I'm going to send you out 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got to put it in through the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: They will send out 20 of the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: So like I said, the ones you have are safe if you wanted them as a backup plan,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you can toss them if you want to do that too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, I appreciate it. I'm glad I called you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm glad you called too because if there's ever a mistake, we will fix it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry about that, but it's all fixed now.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, Barry. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
