    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks, Paul Viagra Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn, I wanted to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: They cannot be a tester. Um, your name Matt?\n\nSpeaker 2: It sure is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, man, I do see you are a VIP here. Um, do you mind if I ask why is that you want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have way too many of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, it does look like you got some pretty big orders there. Um, well, you can order the rest of them as needed if you want. I can kind of just set it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you call in for your next one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, that's fine. Yeah, I just didn't want the automatic refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no worries. So basically what we do is we'll just leave for the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: We will leave your prescription open so your refills are available to you and you'd have to call for your next one in that time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you'd like, I can also give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to take it but, um, it does help kind of get through the wait line when we got, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: Long calls on, like a long wait, and you can call me directly and I can also make sure that your account actually stays\n\nSpeaker 1: This way as\n\nSpeaker 2: For you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Is there just a double check on that real quick? Is there any reason why it wouldn't stay that way?\n\nSpeaker 2: Say if you want mine or something, or say you place an order with somebody else, they don't know what's going on and they\n\nSpeaker 1: Place an order for you and don't set it back up that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean? Or say if you go online, sometimes it can reverse things that we can change for you on this side.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, that's why I do say just call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way we can place your orders exactly how you want them, the pills, the quantity, and everything, and also make sure that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: After the order is placed that, you know, your next order is how you want it to be as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. Okay. Perfect. That'd be just fine. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Yeah, you're welcome. But if you'd like, it's just zero zero three five. You'd be able to get me. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Zero zero three five. Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty, well you're all set. I did adjust that for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're very welcome. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thank you.",
