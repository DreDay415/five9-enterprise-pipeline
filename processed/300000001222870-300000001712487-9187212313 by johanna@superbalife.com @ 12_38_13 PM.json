    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Joanna speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, basically, I made an order back in December,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they kept charging me for more of the product,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I never wanted them to keep charging me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can just hear that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Also, the product that they sent me\n\nSpeaker 1: wasn't the same one they advertised.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you confirm your name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you confirm your name and date of birth, please, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Betty Woods, 1947.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I have your account pulled up here,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I do see that you got an order in December,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you got another one on the 21st of this month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't reorder it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I didn't reorder it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why they did that, but, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do apologize.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you placed this order initially online,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it automatically set you up that way,\n\nSpeaker 2: but not to worry, because we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're actually a telehealth,\n\nSpeaker 2: so when the doctor wrote the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: he made it available with refills\n\nSpeaker 2: so that you can get your refills\n\nSpeaker 1: when you want to place future orders,\n\nSpeaker 2: because, as you know, we do need an active prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: to fulfill the order with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: What they sent me was regular Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they were supposed to send me the new formula, AG,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so they got the wrong product to me also.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I want to address that as well, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have it in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you read to me what it says on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give me a minute. I'll have to get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what information did you need off of the...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do you mind pulling out one of the tablets\n\nSpeaker 1: and reading to me what it says on there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Does the yellow...\n\nSpeaker 1: or yellow...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, on one of the tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pull out one of the tablets from the bottle\n\nSpeaker 2: and read to me what it says on the actual tablet.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way I can confirm what the...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, on the tablet itself?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't quite...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't really say anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just a white tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Flip it over.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it say anything on the other side?\n\nSpeaker 2: Um...\n\nSpeaker 1: It says AGF22.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you for verifying that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: It seems like the pharmacy made an error\n\nSpeaker 1: and sent you the incorrect one.\n\nSpeaker 2: But not to worry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you the replacement of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to receive a total of 40 AGV tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: How you're going to know that it's the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's going to say 100 on the actual pill itself.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when you take it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you most certainly are going to notice a big difference\n\nSpeaker 1: in how well it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is recommended with all Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: When people take it with a large, fatty meal,\n\nSpeaker 1: they'll say that it doesn't work as well,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's because your body will eliminate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to want to make sure\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll say that it doesn't work as well,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's because your body will eliminate it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it won't absorb it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is important to take it on an empty stomach\n\nSpeaker 2: for the best results.\n\nSpeaker 1: But with the AGV, regardless,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to notice a significant improvement.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll send that out to you at zero cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll replace not only the ones you got,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'll add an extra 10 in there\n\nSpeaker 2: just for the inconvenience.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do apologize if the pharmacy sent the incorrect one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I will place your account on a pause\n\nSpeaker 1: until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you have plenty of time to try it out\n\nSpeaker 1: and see for yourself how well it works\n\nSpeaker 2: and then decide how you want to set up\n\nSpeaker 1: your account going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for calling in and letting me know this,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I will get this fixed for you right away.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have a reference number for that, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: A reference number?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can give you a reference number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, let me place the refill order for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll be able to give you the...\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you could send it to my email, whatever is best.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it'll just take a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I have order ID number is 903CD63DA.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that Z?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said Z?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll say it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nine, zero, three, C as in cat, D as in dog,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then six, three, eight, D as in dog, A as in apple.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set, Mr. Woods.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.",
