    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hi, I would like to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay Shane, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 4-10-79.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And can I ask the reason for cancellation, how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it doesn't do what I was hoping.\n\nSpeaker 1: It makes me so funny, like, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, do you happen to have the medication on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh no, I don't, it's at home.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because it looks here to me, it looks like the pharmacy made an error and just sent you the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did not receive the ATV.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so give me a second, I'm going to get you out a replacement and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second, 10-29.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect, they're going to be shipping this out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get this new bottle in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to say AGV on the bottle, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number that's imprinted should be the number 50 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's how you can confirm you received the FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now, you can compare your bottles, but right now, I believe your bottle says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: And on the pills, the letters AC are imprinted followed by the numbers 390 or 340 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I think the pharmacy probably ran out of AGV and didn't tell us and they just kept sending you the regular generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I sent you out a replacement to cover those.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what I'm going to do, I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause them for six months because if I cancel you out now, it's going to delete your profile\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pharmacy would not be able to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause you until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I'll give you my extension so you can call me back and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I won't be charged again until July?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And my extension is 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: 20. 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle. Yes, sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
