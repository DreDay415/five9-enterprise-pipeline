Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, my name is Joseph Capik, C-A-P-I-K.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Joseph. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm so glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Joseph?\n\nSpeaker 2: I received, I had a month ago ordered one prescription of Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just received a second delivery today, which I did not request.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I am on some type of automated refill, I do not want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how can I get this rectified?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm assuming 732-299-4019.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Joseph. And what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-26-54.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 15 Auburn Road, Toms River, New Jersey?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular monthly refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So yeah, if you need anything before August 12th, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And again, can I have your name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are your prescriptions on hold. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
