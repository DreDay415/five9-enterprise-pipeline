How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, my name is Gerald Arguello, and I was calling to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can help you out, Gerald. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-8-19-85.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And can I ask the reason for cancellation? How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't seem to be working as good as some others I've tried.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm thinking about going back to something else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem. Do you happen to have the medication on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: I do now, just at home.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, not a problem. I'll go ahead and cancel you out. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Have a good day.",
