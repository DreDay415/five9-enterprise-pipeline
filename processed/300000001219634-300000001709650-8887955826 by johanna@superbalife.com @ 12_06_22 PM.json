    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Adrena speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Kenneth Carter and I was calling about my order that I had with you all.\n\nSpeaker 1: You all are sending me too much, I'm stocking up on this stuff and I'm not, and I don't want to,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather order when I want to order, not be on a consistent order thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was charging my PayPal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can I get the phone number associated with your account, that way I can better serve you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the pharmacy transferred you over.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's 334-663-7492.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's Kenneth Carter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Carter.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir, I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want you to know, sir, that we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Although at this time your account is set up to alert the pharmacy for refills every two months,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're not locked into that.\n\nSpeaker 2: We actually were a telehealth, so when the doctor initially wrote your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: he made that available with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you can determine the frequency and quantity of your orders at any time\n\nSpeaker 1: or place a pause on your account at any time for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So did you want me to remove the every two months and put a hold on your account until end of July?\n\nSpeaker 1: That way if you wish to call in before then, you can call to place an order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, let me do that because I've got like 80-something.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I'm not 66, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I'm not like a spring chicken.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we understand that, and that is exactly why we're so flexible with our customers.\n\nSpeaker 2: We understand that not everyone wants their refills every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you have the option to set it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right now I'm going to put a pause on it until July just to keep your prescription active\n\nSpeaker 1: and available with refills for when you wish to call in and place an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: But should you decide to put it back on a reoccurring, you can also set it up for every five months,\n\nSpeaker 1: every six months, so you're only getting two orders a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can also, and you can always modify that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can also modify the quantity.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you're getting a quantity of 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can also go down to 10, and that would lower the cost as well as the quantity.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just an option for you in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just wanted you to be aware of your options.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll go ahead and I'll place a hold on your account until end of July.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give us a call before then if you wish to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, so I just need to call you on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, it'll be on a hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not going to alert the pharmacy to send you any refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now suppose I don't call.\n\nSpeaker 1: What, it's going to order back to start back sending it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, say that we don't hear from you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't call in before July to place an order or to extend that hold,\n\nSpeaker 2: the pharmacy will receive a notification to send you one order,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's not going to put you back on a monthly reoccurring.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll get that one, and then six months later you'll get another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just put a pause on it because I'm stocking up with that, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I don't want to stock up with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: In fact, if you want,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can even change your next order to be a quantity of 10 rather than a quantity\n\nSpeaker 1: of 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no, leave it like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's on a hold until July 3rd,\n\nSpeaker 1: so call us if you want to delay that further\n\nSpeaker 2: or if you wish to place a refill order before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
