    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. How are you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing well, sir. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not bad. I was wondering if you could help me cancel the subscription I got of the scorebook.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can assist you, sir. I have your account pulled up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see you're a VIP status customer. Can you just confirm your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: April 24, 1960.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Brown.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so what I'm noticing is that currently your account is set up to receive refills on a monthly basis,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we're not a subscription, so you're not locked into monthly fees or required to get your refills every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: The prescription written out by the doctor came available with refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and as our customer, you can determine the frequency of your orders or put a pause on your account at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you can still retain your VIP pricing as well as have a prescription on hand with refills when you want to place a future order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I cancel it entirely, it will cancel your prescription, and you won't be able to place refills again.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's actually what I need to do because I'm on a heart medication now where I can't use these type of drugs.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. Well, thank you for letting us know that some of your medical conditions had changed,\n\nSpeaker 1: and your doctor advised that he does not recommend you to take this Viagra even though it's FDA approved?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Not a problem, sir. I'll go ahead and cancel any future orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do have the option to pause it, though. Did you want to pause it until July?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You can always call in and extend that hold, too, if needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to cancel it entirely?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You got it, sir. You've been canceled, Mr. Brown.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Will they send a confirmation?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if you'll get a confirmation email, but if you log into your account online,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'll see that all future orders have been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: My pleasure. Thanks for calling in. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
