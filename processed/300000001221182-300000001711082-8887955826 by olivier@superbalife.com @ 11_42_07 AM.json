    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viegra. Yes, how are you doing? Good, thank you for asking. Yes, I'm calling\n\nSpeaker 2: because I want to count some more prescriptions. May I have the phone number attached to the\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: There you go, 312-282-1852. You may have to use a different number. I\n\nSpeaker 1: don't have any account under that number. Do you have another phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: 312-485-7865. Mr. Jeremiah Dubin?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I see you have a prescription for Viegra, 100mg, 10 tablets every 30 days. You just don't need it as often or any health concern?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I can't afford it. I don't need it at all no more. I can't afford it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you have the option to pause so you don't receive anything every 30 days and maybe\n\nSpeaker 1: order once or twice a year, which allows you to lock your price. So when you try to reorder Viegra,\n\nSpeaker 2: you don't have to pay a new price because your doctor consultation is still preserved. They\n\nSpeaker 1: don't have to reinvest on getting a new doctor evaluation. You kind of lock your price. You just\n\nSpeaker 2: don't get it every month because you don't need it every month. They pause you up to half a year\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I just want to cancel off right now. So put it on hold, cancel it out\n\nSpeaker 1: because right now I can't afford it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you want to put it on hold or you want to be\n\nSpeaker 1: fully canceled?\n\nSpeaker 2: Fully canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, just be advised, like I said, the price change in the\n\nSpeaker 2: future because they give you the option to put it on hold, like you mentioned, to save your price\n\nSpeaker 1: and reorder so you don't receive or get billed for anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I canceled the doctor prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: they finance for you here, canceled your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can send me an email stating that you canceled it out. I can give you a confirmation number if\n\nSpeaker 2: you like.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would like a confirmation email because every time y'all send it to me,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send me an email. Does anyone know where you can send me an email now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I'm going to request. I don't send email personally. Somebody will send you an email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what do you mean you don't?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't send email. There is somebody in charge of email,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm going to put a request and you're going to receive the email. I can give you a number if\n\nSpeaker 1: you like, but I don't have it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. The confirmation number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. So what? The number\n\nSpeaker 2: three, number two, six, the letter E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that three? Hold on one second. You said D, three,\n\nSpeaker 2: two, six, E.\n\nSpeaker 1: E is an L word?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: One, D again, two, F and C.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything's happening. Fully canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. And you said,\n\nSpeaker 2: so who sent me out an email stating that this prescription is canceled though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You will receive the email today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now you represent, are you a representative?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. So the way it works, we have a service with focusing only on email. So when you need an email, I send you a profile\n\nSpeaker 2: and the matter of the email and they send you the email for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So you have the cancellation.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have been canceled. You have no more doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I say, you might not even be able to reorder. We have no business sending you Vagra. I offer you to pause, to reorder at the\n\nSpeaker 2: same price in the future, because you say you can't afford it right now. You declined that option.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, we have no business sending you something that you don't need. You fully\n\nSpeaker 2: canceled. I can assure you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
