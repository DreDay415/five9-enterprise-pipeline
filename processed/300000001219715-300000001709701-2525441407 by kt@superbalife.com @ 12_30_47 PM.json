Michael?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, but just remember my extension, just in case you need anything at all,\n\nSpeaker 2: even if you get anti-climatic to this and you need something stronger,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can always replace what you have for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're Americans, but you're definitely not calling Valenzuela,\n\nSpeaker 1: so my extension is 0037, and the name's K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on one second. 0037?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just think of a secret agent, 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call the same number, and then dial 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll get to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: If for some odd reason, because I stepped away to use the restroom,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you get someone else, just tell them, hey, write down my number.\n\nSpeaker 2: K.T. will call me.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I did is I did exactly what you wanted,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I actually did more so you could have more control and autonomy.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing I did is I sent an e-mail to Dr. Tariq,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I overrode the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a stop to any and all monthly charges,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I paused your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you get a chance, right, go to scoreblue.com,\n\nSpeaker 1: log in with your wiseguy.1805, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you do that, Michael, you're going to click on the three little lines\n\nSpeaker 1: on the top right of your screen and go to a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now you can get it at any time you want, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The only caveat is we can't do more than one refill in a 30-day period\n\nSpeaker 1: and two refills a year, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: But just click that button when you need or call me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll take good care of you, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can we go ahead and increase the dosage to 100 milligrams instead of 50?\n\nSpeaker 1: I could do this, but when I do this, but what I'll do is I'll do this,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I can override.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just how this works, though, because we're going to increase the dosage,\n\nSpeaker 2: and is you just got to look out for a telephone call that isn't that you're\n\nSpeaker 1: familiar with, it's an unknown number,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to have one of the doctors call you, and when they do,\n\nSpeaker 1: just say, hey, I just want something stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll go ahead and do that, and I'll send you a replacement of about five\n\nSpeaker 2: just to see how it is, and then we'll do your next refill with the 100s again,\n\nSpeaker 1: all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That way we'll make you old.\n\nSpeaker 1: That will be when I click on it, you request them as far as the refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not auto anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the thing is I'm going to send you five of 100 milligrams to make you whole\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can experience it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the next time you want them, just click them or call me,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you have to maintain at least two refills a year because these 100\n\nSpeaker 2: milligrams were all sold out.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's on a first-come, first-served basis,\n\nSpeaker 2: and as long as you maintain 20 pills a year, you'll be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll get you five to start, and just let me know how they go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me the thumbs up and all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll get these to you before Friday, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And just be on the lookout for someone's call and just let them know, like,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, man, the 50 milligrams is not that strong.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if you want to take two, say, hey, I don't want to take two.\n\nSpeaker 1: I only want to take one because usually the 50 milligrams you just take two,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the one will be stronger.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Plus it's about the same in price.\n\nSpeaker 1: But just stay with me on that and keep that story, bud, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll get you these by Friday, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send it to your 3515, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The Wynn Breyer?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, got you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me know when you try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll have fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not here for a long time, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're here for a good time, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Have fun.\n\nSpeaker 2: Make those birds sing, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: See you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Always.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how we roll.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios.",
