There won't be any more billing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I am placing the prescription on hold for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you need anything before the middle of August, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.
