Oh, so you don't have the number for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can probably see. Um, yeah, because it just comes up. Hold on, I'm looking at, okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's 800-301-3257. Thank you. Okay, because I have it blocked online, I can't get it unblocked.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know how to do that? Oh, get the number unblocked? Yeah, because I blocked it one time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, if you go to the number, if you hit on the number, um, okay, so, but you didn't save it\n\nSpeaker 1: under a name or anything, right? No. Okay, so you'd have to look through your phone records\n\nSpeaker 2: for that 800, the number I just gave you. Right. And then if you touch on... Where do you go to get that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I was trying to figure out. Oh, just go into your, um, your phone icon for like, and go\n\nSpeaker 2: under your recent calls, or how long ago was it that you blocked it? Uh, maybe a... Okay, but I'm,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see any blocked number. How do you find all, any blocked numbers that I blocked? That's\n\nSpeaker 2: what I'm trying to find. Okay, why don't you do this? If you go into your calls, and then there's\n\nSpeaker 1: the little magnifying glass to search, why don't you hit that, and then search, put in that number,\n\nSpeaker 2: the 800-301? Okay, maybe we're doing that, you know, because I don't see it. Okay. Okay, wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: That says no results. Okay, well, maybe at home we'll try. Let's see. Okay. All right. Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Bye.",
