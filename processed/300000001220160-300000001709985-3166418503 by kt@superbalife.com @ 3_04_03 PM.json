    "text": "Speaker 1: Mr. Gimple? Yes, sir. Thank you so much for being kind. Just bear with me a few\n\nSpeaker 2: more moments, all right? Like a couple more minutes. I'm just trying to get this\n\nSpeaker 1: thing done as I'm in line waiting for my manager to walk in his door, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I had to walk back. Okay. I do have one question for you before you wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. This other stuff you said you were sending me courtesy, free of charge,\n\nSpeaker 2: what was that supposed to do with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: So the activator is an herbal activator. It's organic and it's to help increase the nitric oxide. So basically, there's\n\nSpeaker 2: two cells in the penis, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. So there's one, two chambers too as well. One is for the semen and one is for the urine. So when typically what happens is\n\nSpeaker 2: if there's any type of blockage, right, like calcifying buildup in the cells,\n\nSpeaker 1: it'll cause the nitric oxide will help cause it to relax, to smooth out the\n\nSpeaker 2: corpora carfinosa, which is part of the spongy tissue in the penis, allowing the\n\nSpeaker 1: blood to flow through to cause erection. The other thing, it helps the penile\n\nSpeaker 2: arteries to dilate because of the enhanced increase of oxygen and blood.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in layman terms, it promotes faster recovery, enhances endurance, boosts\n\nSpeaker 2: energy, and supports overall muscle health. And that's typically used for\n\nSpeaker 1: cleansing and detoxing of any blockage. I use it every 60 days and I use it also\n\nSpeaker 2: because I do jiu-jitsu. So if I take too much pharmaceuticals or if I take too much\n\nSpeaker 1: supplementation, there could be some what we call is, how do we say, like when you\n\nSpeaker 2: need to fast because in these manufactured products like supplementations,\n\nSpeaker 1: what we've found with our research team is it's not regulated. With this one I sent\n\nSpeaker 2: you, it is regulated, it is approved, organic, and there's a lot of, how do I say,\n\nSpeaker 1: chemicals that can cause blockage. And if you're already experiencing blockage\n\nSpeaker 2: where the AGV that we sent you that you were prescribed is not working, this is a\n\nSpeaker 1: way to help support your erection. Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it does. So I have a question about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that something that you're going to fill automatically as well?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. What is it? What am I going to do? I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Am I going to get more of this mail to me without me requesting it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. This is just based on what we talked about with you having your experiences of,\n\nSpeaker 2: what was it I put on the note here? You had adverse side effects, headaches, and it\n\nSpeaker 1: wasn't working as intended, so I just sent you something as a complimentary to help\n\nSpeaker 2: you flush you out, and then when you do take the AGV, we see how things go, and\n\nSpeaker 1: then we go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you told me you'd stop. There would not be more automatic refills on the\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. So I put a stop to any and all monthly refills. I put a stop to any\n\nSpeaker 1: and all monthly charges, and I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, and I\n\nSpeaker 2: paused the prescription, and I set it up where when we cross this bridge, when you\n\nSpeaker 1: give me the green light, we have a lot of time. You can give me the thumbs up or the\n\nSpeaker 2: green light, we can go from there, but we don't know, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unless we take this step by step.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's true.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just part of a procedure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just...\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I was just making sure this bottle that you're sending me, that it wasn't\n\nSpeaker 2: going to be something that's going to automatically refill and charge me again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely, and just to be clear, we don't do automatic refills and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a lot of hearsay of people trying to go online and slander our company because\n\nSpeaker 1: they're trying to sway by popular opinion. There's a lot of competition out there, but\n\nSpeaker 2: we don't look at competition. We look at service and product that is certified through\n\nSpeaker 1: FDA, right? So what it was in the past was what happened was Dr. Shamil Tariq has\n\nSpeaker 2: ordered a refill on his behalf, but what I did is I put a stop to that and I canceled\n\nSpeaker 1: his orders, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I paused your prescription because as long as you have a prescription with us, we\n\nSpeaker 2: can always navigate to like Cialis Daily, Sidenafil, Tadanafil, the Blue Viagra. Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 1: makes several different EDs. We're just an inclusive distributor for all their FDA\n\nSpeaker 2: products. The basic Viagra we have, which 99% of pharmacies have them, but in terms\n\nSpeaker 1: of the AGV and the Blue Pill, it's very difficult to get, right? It's very challenging.\n\nSpeaker 2: They only allow certain distributors, and that's based on popularity, too, and\n\nSpeaker 1: effectiveness, if that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Well, I appreciate you helping me on this.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, of course. Take a look at this. I don't know what account. Wait, let me look.\n\nSpeaker 2: The account that you had before, let's see, was I don't even have anything on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't see anything, but you did have a credit done already to you of $135.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Depending on what you use, Mr. Gimple, whether it be, how do we say it? If it's a\n\nSpeaker 2: credit card like Discover, they go pretty quick, like instantly, right? If it's\n\nSpeaker 1: PayPal, it goes back instantly. If it's a debit card, it takes about three to five\n\nSpeaker 2: business days, but that's been done while we're talking because what I did is I\n\nSpeaker 1: shot an email and a message to my director and my manager, and while I was waiting\n\nSpeaker 2: in line, you asked a question, and they just confirmed that it's been done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you verify that, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course, Mr. Gimple. Can you please verify,\n\nSpeaker 2: though, just because I don't want you to lose faith in us and me because I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: always taking pride and honor, bud, in what I do, and I can surely, you know, peace\n\nSpeaker 2: of mind is everything, and that's mental health, you know? I don't want you to\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you put me on hold and you pull up your app or something like that, you can\n\nSpeaker 1: see the 113.95 reflect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Were you able to do that, just to verify you got the money on you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just logging in now to\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Take your time. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm glad you called back and you asked for me, and I did step away, and then I\n\nSpeaker 2: got back, and I got a message saying, hey, you're calling in, and you're wanting\n\nSpeaker 1: to speak to me, so they sent me to you. So I'm so glad that everything worked\n\nSpeaker 2: out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am, too. Sorry it's pulling up now.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, take your time. I'm here to be of service. It's not my time, sir. It's\n\nSpeaker 1: God's time, Mary.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it did come back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a different amount, but it did come back.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says 113.95?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it says $80.49.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wonder why the 84.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on. I'm going back where you put it on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's the same amount they charged my part, $80.49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so very good. So it satisfies everything that we talked about from the\n\nSpeaker 1: Larry Gimple. Okay. If you could, and if no consolation to you, sir, I would\n\nSpeaker 2: greatly appreciate, like, if you went to support at scoreblue.com and let them\n\nSpeaker 1: know, like, you know, your experience with me. You know, I'm up for review. So\n\nSpeaker 2: as a veteran, you know, I'm always looking to do things right and with merit\n\nSpeaker 1: and with honor. And if you just, it doesn't even have to be long. It just\n\nSpeaker 2: could be something authentic and real based on what you experienced with me in\n\nSpeaker 1: the process. The truth is, I'm trying to go back home from LA to San Diego, and\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, I'm done here. I haven't even been here that long in LA. So I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: hoping that I can just work at home and just maybe come up every other week or\n\nSpeaker 2: something like that, if you know what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sure do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you know, it's not how much you make, sir. It's how much you save, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Especially in this volatile market right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you'd be so kind to let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you'd be so kind, sir, to support at Score Blue, let them know how you feel\n\nSpeaker 2: about me. I greatly appreciate it. You know, if it's authentic and it's\n\nSpeaker 1: something of heart.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. And keep in mind, and you're very welcome, sir. You take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
