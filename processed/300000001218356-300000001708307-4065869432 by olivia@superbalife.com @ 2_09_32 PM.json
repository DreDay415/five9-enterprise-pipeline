    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Terry Coven. Is this Score Blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's us. That's us, Terry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so your first name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia, if you have a minute, my name is Terry Coven, and I am a customer of yours for years.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we have a problem with shipping. We've got to figure this out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I had originally ordered Viagra, 50 of them, and paid $263 and some cents on my Visa.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it was shipped originally, I think, on the 8th of January.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never received it. I went to the post office and asked, and they could not find it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called Score Blue last week, spoke with them on Thursday, and they said that they would reship it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would pay extra to get it in a couple of days to my post office box.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a delivery date that it's supposed to be there today at my post office box,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I understand there's a glitch. My post office box is USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a post office box in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're not going to deliver it, as I understand it.\n\nSpeaker 1: They don't deliver today. It's supposed to be shipped today for USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's going to probably be shipped back to you again on today's the 26th.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we need to resolve this somehow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I am already looking into this. I think I have you correctly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said this is Terry, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is. Terry Coven, yes. And I want it shipped to my post office box 6249 Bozeman, Montana 59771.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want it delivered to my address because I live in the country.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so as I understand it, when I just got off the phone with FedEx\n\nSpeaker 1: because I have a FedEx shipping number, they won't deliver to my post office box in Bozeman.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're saying FedEx doesn't deliver to your post office?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. FedEx does not deliver to my post office box. It was supposed to be shipped USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I have a tracking number, but the tracking number is a FedEx\n\nSpeaker 1: and they won't deliver to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Is this typical? Does FedEx usually refuse to deliver?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they don't. FedEx does not deliver to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: It needs to be sent. It needs to be sent in USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I don't understand why we're having this difficulty\n\nSpeaker 2: because I have ordered many times through ScoreBlue, as you can see probably there in my files,\n\nSpeaker 1: that I originally ordered to go to my post office box on the 6th end of January\n\nSpeaker 2: and it was taken out of my Visa account of $263 and I never got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I went to the post office box as tracking, never got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I called last Thursday and said, look, I have a problem and they said we will reship it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I said it's got to go to my post office box USPS,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I have a feeling that something's screwed up because FedEx won't deliver.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a tracking number, but it's a FedEx tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So our only option for express shipping is FedEx\n\nSpeaker 1: and the FedEx number that I see says that it will get to you on Monday before 5 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my wife went there for me and we checked and they don't have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they said that they don't usually get FedEx delivered to the USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: They said usually.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the thing is that it is completely valid that there were 50 pills you paid for\n\nSpeaker 1: that you didn't receive that you would be upset you'd call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'd get them reshipped. We did that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where did you ship it?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's completely valid to exactly where you asked.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6249.\n\nSpeaker 2: 6249. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Was it two day air?\n\nSpeaker 2: The express shipping, she did the $28 one, so that is two day air. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I was told that you cannot, when I called, you cannot ship to a post office box in two day air.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not possible. That's what I just found out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment. I'll be right back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.",
