    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra and Scorablue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. My doctor has told me that these pills are not for me and they have an ill effect on me, so I need to stop the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. Yeah, sorry to hear that. I understand that can be frustrating, but we can obviously adjust this for you. Can I get your full name and date of birth under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: John Spagnetti, 11-4-55.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm looking at your prescription here. That was for the 50 milligram Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And did your doctor mention that, I mean, you know, because I see, I'm looking at your health survey. Is it the oxycodone that's mixing it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, Jardiance is usually fine. Lantus is usually fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's not doing, it's not giving me a good effect. That's what it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're saying it's not as effective as what you wanted?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry? It's not, you're saying the erection is not as strong as what you were thinking it would be?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the—\n\nSpeaker 2: Aspirin's not working at all. It's just making my heart go faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. So this was the prescription for the 50 milligram Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so I can cancel this out for you. So upon cancellation, the prescription is officially closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any future prescriptions would require a new and separate health survey and approval by a doctor. Is that okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, John, I went ahead and canceled that for you. You're all set. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
