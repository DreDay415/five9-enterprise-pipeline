    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, how come, you know, this pill, you know, I got them today and it came and it's a, now\n\nSpeaker 1: it's saying authorized generic? What, where's the marking on this? It says AGR. These AGRs,\n\nSpeaker 2: these are just generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV, so that's what that does stand for, AGV. That stands for authorized generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: What it is, is that's the newest pill from Pfizer. So if you, um, place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but don't, they don't say what they're supposed to say. They're supposed to say Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: AGR. These pills don't say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So AGV on the ad, but that's just marketing though. The important thing is the, um, is\n\nSpeaker 2: the manufacturer that makes them. So those are the pills that work in as little as 11\n\nSpeaker 1: minutes and last up to 14 hours in the system. So give them a shot. I think you'll, I think\n\nSpeaker 2: you'll be very impressed when you try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's going to happen now? I don't want to order it again. Are they going to\n\nSpeaker 2: continue every month sending them to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: So your order does come with refills, but it doesn't have to be like every month or\n\nSpeaker 2: anything. I can pause that service for three, four, five, six months. Give you some time\n\nSpeaker 1: to try the pills if you do want to call back and place an order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but they're not going to recharge me and send me just to send it to me, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't call on that six months, it will go out again. So say I push the order,\n\nSpeaker 2: pause it for six months. That'd be until like August. You would need to call us back before\n\nSpeaker 1: August if you don't want that order to go out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, just put it right now. Well, let's do that. Pause it. Let me see. Call me in August.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, in case you like them, you know, in case you like them, then you know, you'll\n\nSpeaker 2: have the opportunity to place another order, but you'll have that time to decide though,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, like a little buffer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And also how about food?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no food. No food, no alcohol. Try to hydrate as well as you can. I always tell\n\nSpeaker 2: guys to drink a lot of water on this stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know. I've worked with these before. I've had these before. I used to sell them before.\n\nSpeaker 2: I used to sell 200 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, from India.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's hilarious.\n\nSpeaker 2: They could stay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 200 milligrams from India, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They just probably put 200 on there, but I was using them and then one day, they didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: work no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unregulated, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, probably, that's right. It's unregulated. Maybe the ones they were sending was good\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're fake. This is FDA. So the same thing, no food, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: No food.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Yes, that's correct. Yep. No food. None.\n\nSpeaker 2: When do I eat though?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, as long as you're like an hour and a half out from a meal, you'll be fine. Even\n\nSpeaker 2: like 90 minutes, at least. Yeah. Not like eating and then an hour later, take it. Give\n\nSpeaker 1: it like 90 minutes from a meal to when you take the pill before or after, I would say.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you tried it yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have. I mean, I'm younger though, so I don't like need it, but I think it's just a...\n\nSpeaker 2: It's an enhancement, dude. That's all it is. It doesn't... People get shy. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's an enhancement, period.\n\nSpeaker 2: It worked really, really well for me, if that's what you're asking. Yes, I definitely...\n\nSpeaker 1: How'd you do your meal?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I think I like skipped my lunch and just went straight before dinner. Like I got busy,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, and then dinner after. It's been a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm thinking about having breakfast and then wait till... Let nature take its\n\nSpeaker 1: course and then for dinner, eat. But then after you eat, is it going to still work again\n\nSpeaker 2: or you have to wait like you said 90 minutes?\n\nSpeaker 1: You should be okay. It should still work once it already activates. You just want to activate\n\nSpeaker 2: it before any meal hits.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fair enough. All right. What if you take it and then you have a meal?\n\nSpeaker 2: You'd be okay as long as it's activated already though, you know? Yeah, so give it some time\n\nSpeaker 1: to get into your system before you have a meal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. No problem. Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
