    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Rob?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey bud, if you could get a pen, I did exactly what you needed to satisfy and make things\n\nSpeaker 2: right bud and make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you get a chance, my name is KT Goodrich, like Kilo, Tango, last name Goodrich is entire.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you my direct number so we can get you this credit back bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I gotta go get a pen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you want to give me that information again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your name and stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: K, my name is my initials because it's very complicated, so just go by Kilo, Tango, KT,\n\nSpeaker 1: and my last name, Robert, is Goodrich as entire, like BF Goodrich, but KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then my direct extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me explain to you what I did because it's a little complex, but I'm going to make\n\nSpeaker 2: it as simple as possible because I did exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills, and I put a stop\n\nSpeaker 2: to any and all monthly charges, and I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, and\n\nSpeaker 1: I paused your prescription and I started your credit process for the December batch and\n\nSpeaker 2: the January batch, which you didn't authorize, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now in light of that, because they didn't work since 11-22 when you tried them, I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: replacing those two as well with something that works for veterans like me and you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be 100 milligrams, but they're just more potent and they're stronger with\n\nSpeaker 2: little to no side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: So run a dry run on this one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll try it, but I don't want a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, don't worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What we'll do is I put a stop to all this, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing what's right, Rob, is I'm replacing what you already got charged in November.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm giving you something that would work for you on cases like yours that it wasn't strong\n\nSpeaker 1: enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this should work.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is like a Hail Mary.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now the other two ones that I'm sending you credit on, I'm going to give you instructions\n\nSpeaker 1: how to do it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way to do it is I'm starting the credit process, but all I need you to do is\n\nSpeaker 1: return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: Put it back in that batch and seal it up and then give it to the postman and just put refused\n\nSpeaker 1: return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I put both bottles in one envelope and send it back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's affirmative, but do me a favor because USPS, they're very clever because they don't\n\nSpeaker 1: make as much money and they're getting overrun by Amazon and FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 2: They like to say like, oh, you can't send these back.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to pay for them, but we have a tracking number on them already.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you seal them back nicely, neatly, and just write refused return to sender, you don't\n\nSpeaker 1: have to pay any nominal fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can see it come back.\n\nSpeaker 1: By Friday, we should get it, or Monday, and I'll credit you the 63.95 times two for the\n\nSpeaker 2: December and the January.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm sending you today something that's more beautiful and powerful so you can actually\n\nSpeaker 2: enjoy why you even damn called us.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: And as a veteran, you know, and you're a veteran, let's look out for each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: All brothers together, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's run this.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then just stay in touch with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trust in the process.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll get that money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on Friday, give me a call, and then we'll credit your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: At Friday, the best, or Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in mind there's a storm going around, so it might slow things down.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's no fault to your own or my own.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just the other men and women.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't get out of my driveway.\n\nSpeaker 1: In fact, I got my wife's car stuck today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man, I'll be praying for you guys, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But don't go to a post office, just put it in your damn box and let these guys come get\n\nSpeaker 2: them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just hope that no one steals it, though, bud, because if we don't get these back today,\n\nSpeaker 1: they won't credit.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've got to honor you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to get this money back to you, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's refuse it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll have to mail it tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your health and safety and security is more important right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you can go.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not going anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to get you this money, and I want to get your replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have my extension, 0037, and we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll run a play-by-play.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Bob.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.T.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodrich here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sergeant Shaw.\n\nSpeaker 2: Over and out.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your service, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: See you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
