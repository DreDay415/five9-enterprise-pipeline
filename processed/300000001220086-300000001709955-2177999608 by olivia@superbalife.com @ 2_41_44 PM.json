How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, not bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Bradley?\n\nSpeaker 2: I did not know that they would just automatically keep ordering for me, so I was needing to cancel my order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay, Bradley, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-22-1970.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 651 North Trojan Complex Road, Covington, Indiana, 47932?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And this refill from today, you do not need it, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So I just canceled and refunded that order, so you should see that refund within these next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option with the prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to place it on hold and you did want to order before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. All right, so yeah, if you need anything before the end of July, just give us a call because your prescription is on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty. Well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
