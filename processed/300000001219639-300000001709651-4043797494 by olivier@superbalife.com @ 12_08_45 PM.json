I have water.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, can you grab...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I got the pill in front of me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, can you grab a single pill and tell me the code on the pill, the actual pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought I was getting the new Viagra pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It works in 10 minutes and all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I got some of these.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is AC339.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's regular, generic, because I was asking because...\n\nSpeaker 1: Hell, I got some of these.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you. I'm going to send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was asking because I saw...\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes it happens when the website is overloaded with orders that, you know, the spec of your order came, you know, kind of, you know, not the way it's supposed to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I just see Viagra, 50 milligrams, Adenafil, so that's what the pharmacy fulfilled.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you said you were trying to place a different order, which is the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill is going to have a different code.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill should say 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'm going to do, I'm going to send you a replacement, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because for some reason, from our website, I guess your order was populated not properly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you a replacement with AGV, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hell, yeah, I got some of these there, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need to spend $60 on some more of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then...\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you're going to...\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV is going to say 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't mix them together.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a completely different formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV has been improved and is way better.\n\nSpeaker 2: So...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, they'll be a lot stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: ...to get your body activated for even better results.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because some patients just take one pill, and they think it's going to be resolved overnight.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you got to keep taking your meds, and then you're going to see improvement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or your body, you know, appropriates the meds more.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you get also faster activation, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so 50 milligrams, 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to be the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, Chad, you already paid for your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is just a replacement, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Forget you the right stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was able to send that to you at low 5 to 10 business day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, 2 to 5 business day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you will receive this replacement, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: With the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill is going to say 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC340 or AC399, this is just regular generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV says 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Different formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: Way better.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're all set, Mr. Cowart.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for calling.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
