Yeah, so how can I help you today, Jonathan?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my subscription again. I've canceled it three times and they just keep showing up and charging me again. I need to stop this before I have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back. I'm not even living at that address anymore, I just happened to get a notification on my bank statement that y'all charged me again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so yeah, the AGV, it didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah, then I can definitely cancel your script for you. In regards to that other order, the refill, so we can always refund you, you just have to return the product back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't live there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know who lives where you're delivering this stuff. I'm not there anymore. I canceled it six months ago or however long it's been.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The notes I have about the conversation you had was that he offered you the free sample and the activator in exchange for pausing your prescription for half a year and that you would call to reorder or to let us know if you didn't want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: I called to cancel it because I knew I was about to be moving and he talked me into taking this free activator and one more for free. He didn't say anything about pausing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I called to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is some underhanded mess.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, so he wouldn't have been able to send you the free products without a prescription and all of their prescriptions do have to come with at least one refill every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so he lied to me then.\n\nSpeaker 2: He lied to me just to get more money.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not happy. Stop sending me stuff. You don't have my correct address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we have already took care of that part.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I get charged again, I will get a lawyer involved and get all my money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I already took care of that part.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, I mean you always know where to find us and I am sorry to hear that the AGV didn't work out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Eric.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
