    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I have a problem with your company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what's going on, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, here's what's happened. I checked my bank account and I saw that I had received some payments and deductions on my account from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: One was $63 and some cents and the other was $29 and some cents, and I did not order these. I did not have anything to do with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait a second. Let me finish telling you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to pull up your information here so I can kind of follow along.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to let you finish until I finish so you understand what's happening.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I called my bank and I put a hold on these because what the bank told me, which is Chase Bank, what the bank told me was that somehow somebody has read my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: And secondly, just to let you know, I never got anything. I never got a product.\n\nSpeaker 2: So somebody has ingeniously taken my number and also taken the product because I don't have a product.\n\nSpeaker 1: And here's the other issue. I'm 84 years old with pulmonary and heart problems. Why the hell would I buy an EMD drug?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'm a single guy. I'm 84 years old, almost 85. Why the hell would I have a drug like this?\n\nSpeaker 1: So somebody has done this. I don't know who. I have no freaking idea because I don't have a product. All I got is somebody charged my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Scott Ferguson.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your date of birth, Mr. Ferguson?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-14-41.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you at 5041 Guava Avenue, Unit 217, La Mesa?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is exactly my address.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not sure what happened. The first order was placed on November 20th. The $63.95 is our price for 10 pills. And the $21.40 is the price for an upgrade.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have no idea about any of that. Somebody is... what the bank...\n\nSpeaker 2: I can cancel this out for you. That's no issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't want this product. I don't want somebody to steal this money from me, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I don't know what's going on over there. It sounds really strange to me just hearing this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you should have seen my feeling when I saw it on my bank account.\n\nSpeaker 2: But why would someone steal your identity, you know, and put this product and then send it to your address is the question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I mean, they get everything from my... I don't know how these people do it. I'm not a technical guy. I mean, I couldn't order this if I tried without my kids helping me.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I mean. Why would someone put your address and steal your money but send you the product?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what the bank told me is that when they read the card, they can check on the card because they have all the codes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't know the answer to this. All I know is...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can cancel this out for you, Mr. Ferguson, and you won't get anything else. You won't be charged or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it does seem like you placed this order just because all of your information's here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just... like, why would I steal someone's identity and then send product to them? It doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to cancel this for you. This won't ever happen again, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give you the answer to that. You're not the only one that this happened. I had another product the same way, not this product, but actually it was a laptop, that they did the same thing to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm not only putting a hold on your stuff, I'm putting a hold on two other things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Somebody slid my card somewhere. The bank tells me most of the time this happens at restaurants because... I don't know. I have no friggin' idea how this happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I get you. Well, I've got your account all deactivated and canceled out, Mr. Ferguson, so you're not going to get anything with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: You won't be getting any orders or anything. But, yeah, it's just strange, you know, that they would send the product, buy something and then send it to you if it was like fraud or what have you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think it's got to be somebody that's living in the same apartment I am. I don't know what else to say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's the only thing I would imagine also. It is strange, but I'm sorry about that, Mr. Ferguson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know, I also notified the postman that this was happening to me and to tell me if anybody took anything out of my thing, you know? I mean, I have no idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's stranger to me than it is to you, to be honest, because there's no way I need this kind of drug. I mean, God Almighty. I'm lucky to be walking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I get you. So, yeah, I'll cancel that out for you. I've noted down the profile. So, if this ever happens again, we'll reach out to you if someone like, you know, for some reason gets your information and like, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would appreciate how you're handling it because I don't even know how to explain it really good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, another thing I could say, I know a lot of people don't like to hear things like this, but I don't know if you have like a family member, a grandson, a nephew, a son, someone could be ordering these pills to your home and just taking them with your car, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, if there's like another guy around there, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: That'd be a little difficult for my grandson and my grandchildren because they live in Hawaii.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just keep an eye on it, Mr. Ferguson. We will as well. If we see any activity, I'll reach out, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the way you handled it. It was hard for me to do, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. No problem. So, this won't happen again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
