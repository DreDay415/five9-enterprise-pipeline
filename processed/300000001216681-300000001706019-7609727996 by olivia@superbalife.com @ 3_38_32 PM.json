How can I help you today, Jonathan?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got another subscription in the mail and I wanted to actually cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to try it out one time and then I guess it automatically signed me up for ongoing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm fine with what I got but I don't want it to continue month to month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Jonathan, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 8-27-82.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great, and you're located at 41153 Scarlet Court, Indio, California, 92203?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular monthly refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to place an order before then, during that duration of time, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I will place the prescription on hold for you, and then if you need anything before July 23rd,\n\nSpeaker 1: just give us a call at this number, Monday through Friday, 8-5, to place the order whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: So does that mean it's going to automatically order again in July, or I still would have to call?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no, I want to cancel it completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to just put it on for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't want an ongoing cost period.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried it a couple times.\n\nSpeaker 2: They work fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just don't need it right now, and I just don't need it that bad, so I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the thing is, or my job to communicate.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't really care.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to pay anything anymore, so there's nothing you can say to convince me to wait six months\n\nSpeaker 2: and then let you charge me in six months because you did that with this one in the two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not trying to refund for this one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want it canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried it online, and I kept trying, and I kept trying.",
