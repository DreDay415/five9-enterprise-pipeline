    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Jimmy, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me see if I can pull you up and help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ask who I'm speaking to, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Patrick Orocasti, R-O-H-R-K-E-S-T-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Patrick, I was able to pull you up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I currently see that you are getting the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you're getting the 50 milligram, and it looks like that you're getting 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sent to you every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and take care of your request, first of all, before we go any further.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I didn't realize it was a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, that meant that the first supply that I got on November 23rd probably will last me at least a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just realized I got the December 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when I saw the email on my credit card for the January 23rd, I'd like to have that one canceled because I don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, that one has been shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: It shipped out on the 23rd to you, but you can always return that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let me ask you, is that becoming too frequently?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what it is?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because we don't have to have it set up where you get them every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can push that back, like, twice a year if that's something that's more convenient for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that does, that'll keep your prescription on file with us, and it will allow you to order when you want to,\n\nSpeaker 2: as far as that's concerned, within a six-month period rather than having them shipped to you automatically every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would that be something that would – go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: What were you going to say?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can return the one that just got shipped on January 23rd?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how do I do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just say return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I recommend on the package, what I recommend is that you get a tracking number, too,\n\nSpeaker 2: so therefore you can see exactly when we get it back so we can credit you back that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: But while I have you on the phone, let me ask you, how are the 50 milligrams working for you when you use them?\n\nSpeaker 2: How do they do for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I've used it once, and I've got – it's about a two-year supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you can just – if you want to just suspend my account where there's no future orders unless I contact you,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's fine, but don't –\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause it out for, like, six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if six months is too soon, all you have to do is do what you're doing now,\n\nSpeaker 2: just pause me out another five or six months, and we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that does, that keeps you at this discounted price that you're getting it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I know the fact that the price is going to go up in the future because of the tariffs.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now our pills come from the Pfizer labs in France, and we haven't been hit by them yet,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I know in the future we are going to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to go up, like, almost two or three times as much.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what this will do, this will keep your prescription active, and it will be, like, twice a year situation.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if, like, for instance, I can change the time, the next order would be – it would be –\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll tell you the exact date.\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be – we're looking at July 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you can call any time before July 23rd and say, push me back another four or five months,\n\nSpeaker 1: therefore that will keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I set up so it's every six months now, too, as well as every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not getting them every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: That doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd rather just go ahead and cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll go ahead and take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do have to tell you, if you cancel the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: that means it will be difficult to even order in the future because you did have a prescription on file\n\nSpeaker 2: with us that you decided not to use.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we definitely would be – it would make it a lot harder to order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I was trying to postpone it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll accept that risk.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to let you know the options, and that's why I'm talking to you about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we will go ahead and just take care of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We went ahead and stopped your auto shipment, and it's been done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there anything else I can do for you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nope, we're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
