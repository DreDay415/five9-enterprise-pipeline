How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Brian?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to pause any future orders for right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can do that. Yeah, I can place your script on hold for up to six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then if you need anything before July 27th, you can have it. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I won't get any more orders unless I call you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So the prescription is on hold until July 27th. So anything you need before then, you'll have to call us. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. Thank you so much, Brian. Yeah. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.",
