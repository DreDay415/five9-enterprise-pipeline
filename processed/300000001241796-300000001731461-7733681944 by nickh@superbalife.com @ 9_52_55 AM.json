    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra, I score blue, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just wanted to know, you didn't give me, it said it accepted me and I got the money,\n\nSpeaker 1: they took the money, but it didn't say when it would be sent or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: They didn't give me no...\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, let me get your information here, we'll pull up your chart and see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Roger Gonzalez, August 14, 1963.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Gonzalez, this is for the quantity of 10, the 50 mg Viagra, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it looks like...\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the new one, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, so it looks like the doctor wrote you the prescription, so that's confirmed.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the order was placed...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see it today at 3:28, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what's going to happen is the doctor approved you this morning,\n\nSpeaker 2: the pharmacy is currently preparing your order, once that order gets the tracking number,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's when you'll get emailed your package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's what I just wanted to make sure you guys got in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And one thing, is this really good stuff or is this just your job?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, the AGB is the newest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: My dad used to take the generic Viagra and now he is on the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's pretty happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Big thing is less side effects, and it just kicks in a little quicker.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's about 55 years old, pretty healthy guy.\n\nSpeaker 1: He just needs it for a little extra boost, but he's happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's what I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what did it say, it's a risk or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Say that again?\n\nSpeaker 1: You said it was a risk?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, there's less risks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Less side effects, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great, then it's good stuff, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I never tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is coming directly from Pfizer, so the way you can tell it's from Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 2: is on the bottom right-hand corner of the white label.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yours should say Greenstone, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, one more question.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is only one buy, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not like the monthly stuff like that, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So these prescriptions are written with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, whether or not you want it monthly is perfectly up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want to adjust it, I can do that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, I just want to try it once and see if it works,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I can work that stuff, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't want it monthly, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so let me adjust that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to put a pause on there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then you can try it, and then you can give us a call\n\nSpeaker 2: and let us know how you like it, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no, I don't want it monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm putting a pause on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is written with 12 refills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I cancel your prescription right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: you won't have access to any medication in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: By putting a pause on it, it keeps the prescription active,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it doesn't allow refills to go through monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you need to do is after you try the medication,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can get back to us and let us know how to proceed,\n\nSpeaker 2: whether or not you want those refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I see what you're telling me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I'm happy with them, then I can call you, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what if I don't call you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I still get them?\n\nSpeaker 2: You will get your first order, correct,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'm putting a pause on it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just give us a call and let us know how it worked out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have 100% satisfaction guarantee.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I do want them, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, and if you don't want them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's cool because I just really wanted to test it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have 100% satisfaction guarantee.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you're not completely satisfied, give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just want to try them out because I just don't want to be committed.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, but what I'm saying is we're happy to extend you a refund\n\nSpeaker 1: if you're not completely satisfied.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: So give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm putting that pause on there so it's taking care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
