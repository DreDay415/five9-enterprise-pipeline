I want you to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so I'm canceling the doctor's prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: We advise of the price change.\n\nSpeaker 1: If the company takes your order, they're going to apply the cost of a new doctor consultation probably in the price, because we're losing that one right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, everything has been cancelled, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
