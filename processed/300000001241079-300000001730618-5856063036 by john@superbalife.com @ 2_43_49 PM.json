So your order's all set, like it went through. It is going to ship out tomorrow, it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it got approved and then it's set to ship out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be emailed, your email that we have here, with a tracking link from the Postal Service once it ships.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's usually the time, two days? So what, you think about Monday?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you ordered it yesterday.
