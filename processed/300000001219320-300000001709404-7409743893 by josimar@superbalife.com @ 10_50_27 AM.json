And his first name is Matt?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. So I do see there's an order currently at the pharmacy. Let me just review it to make sure everything's all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, you were approved recently and the order's actually going to ship out. You'll receive this in about three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day, though, sir. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will they send me an email letting me know it's been shipped so I can track it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, get a tracking number, send through email.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
