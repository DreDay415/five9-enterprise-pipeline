Souder, and I got a charge on my credit card today, and I never ordered a repeat order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can take a look in your account here, what's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Souder, S-A-U-T-E-R, and then 59634.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, as you see here, you made an order down on December 27th, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you get a moment to read the email that was sent out to you after making that order?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, basically, every order is going to be a prescription-based order.\n\nSpeaker 2: It needs a prescription date, refill date, to remain active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Without that, you would lose access to the prescription and the visit, and you wouldn't be able to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, you can always call us to modify it to your preference.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like on the doctor's side, he sets you up for every month, which is why you got billed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You go ahead and see if he's able to cancel it out for you, but on my end, what I could do for future orders is I could actually modify it to the every six-month freeze plan, where you can actually just call us when you need it or call us to delay it even further, but that way you don't receive this every month, and so I'll have access to it for when you need it down the road again.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're going to cancel that, my repeat?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, were you able to listen to anything I just said right there, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm kind of hard of hearing, but...\n\nSpeaker 1: I was explaining how you could just freeze it out, because by canceling, you would lose complete access to the prescription, but if I put you to our six-month freeze plan, you're able to...\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't want to do that, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: ...delay it further.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to cancel out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in mind, sir, the moment it's canceled out, you will not be able to order this anymore because the visit would be deleted, and we're not going to cover the cost for another visit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's been fully closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can no longer purchase this product from us, but you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you going to credit my account then, card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, I canceled out the order that was at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get that in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
