    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Clint speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I'm calling, um, I just got, I canceled my subscription with you guys, and you guys just billed me, you guys just billed me, I emailed and canceled months ago, you guys haven't billed me in months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you follow the instructions that the email said that we replied back to you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: I, I, I canceled, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so when you sent the email, we sent the email back to you, did you follow the instructions in that email?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't, I fully canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't seem like you're listening to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it doesn't seem like you're listening, I fully canceled, I haven't been billed in months, but you guys just billed me today.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't fully cancel, sir, because we don't do cancellations over email.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm telling you, I, I, I had to email, and they told me to call, and I called, and I canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: When did you call?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't see any notation of any phone calls here from you at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when was the last time you billed me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Besides today.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last time you were billed was on the 28th, it was today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Today, yeah, but before that, when was I billed?\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't been billed, because I canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: October 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't been since October, because you guys gave me, you guys didn't even give me the right medication, it was not anything that you guys advertised, and I canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I would like to have my money refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, just send it back to us, and we'll give it to you, the refund for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, the refund that you guys took today, all my money back that you guys took today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I mean, it's been shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's been shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want no more of your crappy medicine, that's not anything, it's generic, it is,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's generic Viagra, it's not even the crap that you guys, no, it's junk, it's junk,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's nothing what you guys said it was, it's not even, it's not even what you guys,\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, so it's not even what you guys, it's not even what the prescription said,\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription said AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you guys, I read all the reviews on you guys, you guys are a bunch of junk, cuddle and swindlers, I want my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want my money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, guess what, I'm gonna turn you guys into the Better Business Bureau, I'm gonna get my money back, so, and you don't have permission to do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't, you weren't supposed to bill me, you haven't billed me in fucking months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and now you're taking money out, all of a sudden, that's illegal.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I canceled, dude, you're not hearing me, I canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I said I started through email, I started through email, and then they told me I couldn't do it through email and I had to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, of course you don't, no you wouldn't, you guys, there's thousands of reviews, you guys are not canceling people, you guys are so bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, so you guys haven't billed me, haven't billed me since October, haven't billed me\n\nSpeaker 1: since October, so why wasn't I billed if I didn't call back?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't care about your notations, obviously I called back because I haven't been billed\n\nSpeaker 1: in fucking months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, correct, some people get their orders once every six months, you're not the only\n\nSpeaker 1: person that gets one order in a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I got a 30-day supply, dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you set it up to get it as needed when you did that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I told them I didn't want to try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you ordered it, you set it up as needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can't just say, no, I want to try it, you have to actually hit the option to order as\n\nSpeaker 1: needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: There is no option for that, you know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, no, there is an option for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, there's not.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, this is bullshit, I want my money back, dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because obviously having a conversation here is not going to get us both either anywhere\n\nSpeaker 2: because you really don't have good listening skills, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you don't have good communication skills, you don't have good truth-telling skills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You work for a fucking scumbag company.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's really a shame that you're as old as you are and you're this rude and nasty.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's really a shame.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, well, let me steal your money and see how fucking polite you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you guys should be ashamed, you're robbing people.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and cancel this for you because I don't want you to blow an aneurysm or anything and you should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we'll get the money back to you today, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
