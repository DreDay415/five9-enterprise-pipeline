Good morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I want to know, my credit card was charged on the 24th, on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I placed an order, you know, like back in February, December 24th, and I got my order and everything,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I didn't, like, have, like, an automatic thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, my card was charged Saturday, this Saturday, the 24th again.\n\nSpeaker 1: The reason why I was charged, I'm calling you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, Mr. Guillermo Serrano.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, good afternoon.\n\nSpeaker 2: New Jersey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so what happened was, let me tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What happened was you got a prescription for Viagra, 50mg, 10 tablets from Dr. Mayer,\n\nSpeaker 1: and what happened was he wrote it, because your original order was 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: even though you got the pill upgrade, but the regular order was 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, he wrote it with refills, right, with your prescription, but if you don't need it,\n\nSpeaker 2: what I can do for you, I can advise the pharmacy to stop the monthly, the original 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're just going to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, yes, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because monthly is not required anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get it once or twice a year, or you can get it more often.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, because, you know, sometimes you don't get it every day, you know, so you have to, you have excess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, do you know how often you need it? Maybe every three months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, but, you know, I'd rather me place the order and not be like an automatic thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to close that for you for half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, this one, one minute, this one is for 10 pills, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, only 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and is the price different, a 100 mg and a 50 mg?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, we can, because you're an active patient still, so we can order the same price you have and give you a higher dosage if you like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but yeah, I think I need like a 100 mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, I can set up, I can set up here that your next order will be 100 mg, but, I mean, that one, you will have to place an order in the future and request that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, so, right now, the one, you can send me those 10 pills now, but I just want to not, you know, to be like an every month thing, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, you want every three months, maybe?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want to just call myself, make a call and say I need this, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so, what I'm going to do for you, so for you to not pay a higher price, because when you don't have the doctor consultation, they finance you, they got to get you a new one and they charge you more.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to advise the pharmacy to pause, they pause usually half a year, so you don't get monthly call.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm pretty sure before summer, you're going to need something, so they're going to pause you, so it's not anymore on a monthly basis anymore, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so the charge that was made, is that going to come or are you going to avoid that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's coming, it's coming, yeah, 10 pills are coming, yeah, on the 24th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, so, yeah, so then after that, after that, then it's going to be like, shh, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything is paused, and then you can call, it'll be paused for half a year, and you can get the refill once or twice a year, or you can get more, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, exactly, thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one, and let us know when you place your next order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call, because we're going to have to have the doctor writing 400 milligrams now, so you got to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, we're going to get you 50 milligrams, but you can take two as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, bye.",
