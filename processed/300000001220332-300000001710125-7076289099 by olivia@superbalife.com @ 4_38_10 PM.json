    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Glenn Thompson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, who is this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Glenn Thompson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Glenn. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. I'm glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Glenn?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I was kind of confused about my order.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I ordered, I thought I was only ordering the new one, the new Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And apparently I also ordered the regular Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not need the regular Viagra. It did not work ever.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I need to cancel that part of my order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Glenn, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 10-31-1957.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And you're located at 10556 Combee Road, PMV 6227, Auburn, California?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yes. So I can make sure that you get the HEV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can do that. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I let them know. So this is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will be receiving the HEV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way you'll know is the pills themselves on them, they'll say 1-0-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they are white pills, but they are the HEV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they'll say 1-0-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the sides of the bottle will say HEV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it should say Greenstone because that's the manufacturer for the HEV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm only going to receive the HEV and not the 100-milligram Viagra, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so the HEV is still Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like they're both Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I was just interested in the new one that they were advertising on the radio.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that is definitely the one that acts within 11 to 30 minutes, fastest acting,\n\nSpeaker 1: longest lasting, and we've formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus\n\nSpeaker 2: agitation and headache, which is really nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that's basically what it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: So explain to me what am I getting with this order because I'm confused now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The HEV, that's what you wanted, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the fast-acting one, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to make sure I do this correctly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will be 100 milligrams because that is what you placed it for,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's what the doctor approved you for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I have three things on this order, one for $79, one for $29, and one for $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, have I double-ordered?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it seems to be if that's the thing I need to lose one or two of these items.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you placed the order, the order said, you know, 10 pills, 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: You clicked on that for the Viagra, 100 milligrams, 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: The screen popped up and said, do you want to double the order for 60% off today and only today?\n\nSpeaker 1: We only offer you guys that deal the very first time you order and never again.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we said, do you want to do 10 more pills for $29.40?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you clicked on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were expected to receive 20 pills total.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think I only wanted the 20 pills, and I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to need 100 or how many other pills I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to see if they worked.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to trim off some of this stuff, to be honest,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I don't want to end up with what I had with Rouge or with Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 2: with a shit ton of pills that don't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any way I could just cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can we just cancel the order then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I don't want to make you jump your hoops.\n\nSpeaker 2: And to tell you the truth, I'm getting less and less confident about this as we go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not that you did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at spending $200 on something I only wanted 10 pills to see if it worked for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we already paid for the doctor to conclude you,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you must have placed this, like, not within the last five minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would have placed it, I'm assuming, like a few hours ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't talk to the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but you filled out a really extensive medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's a really extensive process that goes into ordering with us,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is why any time men call, they're like,\n\nSpeaker 1: this order was just placed for me, or this is crazy, or I did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, would you like me to read your medical personal information back to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because this is all the stuff you filled out.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I know, I know, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ma'am, ma'am, I know what I filled out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know what I filled out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can help you whenever you're ready to be helped,\n\nSpeaker 1: which means you're going to allow me to speak.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know when that is, and then I'm happy to help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, what I need now is for you to tell me how I can get rid of the two big fees on here\n\nSpeaker 2: and just to get the bare minimum.",
