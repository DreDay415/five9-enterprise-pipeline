How may I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was trying to place an order for the, what is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: The buyer of the new year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Trying to make sure I would place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't hear you, sir. What you were saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we have a thin coverage issue. What you were saying, Mr. Wiggins?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you come again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. I was trying to...\n\nSpeaker 2: I was trying...\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello? Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why are you on the mobile data? Because we're getting interrupted.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're getting interrupted. It's on and off. I'm not sure if you...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what about now?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay. Yeah, it's okay. Let's see if it works better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what you were saying, Mr. Wiggins?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was trying to place an order for it and not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you were trying to place an order, right, for the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what was your concern again?\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted a one-time order, not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I didn't want it to be reoccurring.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it's not a subscription. It's a prescription with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't need refills, what we do for you to reorder when you need it,\n\nSpeaker 1: we put a pause on the prescription and you can order.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to get it every 30 days, every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get it once or twice a year or more often if you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But there is no commitment. It's based on your need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are pills. This is not Netflix.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the prescription will be open. We put a pause. You receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You give us a call and update if the med is a good fit for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Will I be able to go through with it? Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, we're getting interrupted again. Yeah, what you were saying, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Will I be able to go through with the order that I put in?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so that's what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription will be paused, and when you get it, try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know how you feel, and then you can reorder yourself as well, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Has the prescription went out yet is what I'm asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, if it went out, let me see. You placed the order yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes they don't update right away.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could have been out, but they don't update right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to receive a tracking number because I don't have it yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could be created already, but the account hasn't been updated yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it could be already in the hand of the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes you update 24 hours later, and you're going to have a tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: in your email, rigginsdelmonte at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, well, I didn't see anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so like I said, they could have shipped it, but they haven't updated yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when the system updates fully, you're going to receive your tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: if they send it out or as soon as they send it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but right now you can't tell if it was because I was trying to place the order,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it was already placed then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, your order is placed. Everything is placed.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to place no more order. You're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have no order to place. You just wait on your tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's all I need to know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one.
