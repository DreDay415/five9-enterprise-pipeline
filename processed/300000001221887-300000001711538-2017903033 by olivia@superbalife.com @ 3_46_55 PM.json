    "text": "Speaker 1: I don't know any better about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Richard Ross, and I am a client.\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried to cancel and I still got a delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I guess I don't know how to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with this, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Richard, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 11-1-1954, I have the prescription number if you want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, I think that's not the right birthday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your address?\n\nSpeaker 2: 11-1-1954 is my birthday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, I think you just gave us the wrong birthday,\n\nSpeaker 2: but that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: One in January.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what is your address?\n\nSpeaker 1: The delivery address or the address on my card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Either is fine, I do see that they're different.\n\nSpeaker 1: One is 14 Garden Court in Mawa, 07430, New Jersey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the other one is 16, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 160 River Street Apartment, SOD 38, Hackensack.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular refills\n\nSpeaker 1: with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is if you did want to order\n\nSpeaker 1: before then you could, you just have to give us a call\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I thought I canceled online and I got six pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know how much they cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much was my last six pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it was 10 pills and it's 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess there's no way I can refund that\n\nSpeaker 1: because I have the pills here, right,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm not using them now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, if you want to send them back,\n\nSpeaker 2: then of course that's an option.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nah, I'm not gonna be able to do all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, just, can we cancel it, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the pills, they don't work for you, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I get sick from them, frankly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that happens to some people.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that said, the final part of my job,\n\nSpeaker 2: but of course that makes sense\n\nSpeaker 1: that you want to cancel this script\n\nSpeaker 2: because they make you sick.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the final part of my job is to let you know\n\nSpeaker 2: that if that is the case, you do qualify,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you were interested, for a free sample\n\nSpeaker 2: of our newest, highest quality product,\n\nSpeaker 1: which we have specifically formulated\n\nSpeaker 2: to cut out the side effects\n\nSpeaker 1: of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if those were your side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is my side effect, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the new pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's called our Viagra HEV,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it comes from our Pfizer labs in France,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it is also our fastest acting, longest lasting\n\nSpeaker 1: pill we've ever made, and it's our newest stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, my favorite thing about it\n\nSpeaker 1: is that we formulated it to cut out those side effects, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've used it, or your partner's used it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I don't have, sadly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just said what you like about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sadly, I don't have a partner,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'm 30, yeah, and 34, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not that somebody around my age couldn't talk to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but I thought you said that,\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought you had said you like about it,\n\nSpeaker 1: meaning like you're telling me no using it, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the free sample, it's 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the way it would work is it comes\n\nSpeaker 2: with a five month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you did wanna try them, I'd ship you out 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're completely free.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then does it automatically start sending from then on?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the five month idea is that gives you\n\nSpeaker 1: enough time to know for sure if they work for you or not,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you prefer them to your old script or not,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you love them, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you would just need to let us know by June.\n\nSpeaker 1: You would need to call us at this number\n\nSpeaker 2: and just either say, hey, I've run out,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm ready to order again, or hey, I haven't run out yet\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't use them that often,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I do wanna keep the script.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you place it on hold for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or hey, they don't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like any of those options are available to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to let us know by June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it possible just that I can call back\n\nSpeaker 1: and say I'd like to try that option?\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead of doing it, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't wanna have to start something\n\nSpeaker 2: that I'm not gonna, I don't wanna have to worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The billing upsets me when I have to go look\n\nSpeaker 2: to cancel something and it was hard to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't wanna have something automatically renew on me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So in order to receive the free sample,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do have to have a script with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we can only place that script on hold for so long.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we were just giving out free FDA approved\n\nSpeaker 2: third party tested real Viagra from Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 1: with the, hey, this is yours for infinity\n\nSpeaker 2: and whether we hear from you or not about it doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 1: We would be losing, I don't know\n\nSpeaker 2: how many millions of dollars every year.\n\nSpeaker 1: I actually, it's very funny you're saying that\n\nSpeaker 2: and you seem so sweet.\n\nSpeaker 1: You wouldn't lose 10 cents.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pfizer is making money hands over fist.\n\nSpeaker 1: They have more cash than just about any company\n\nSpeaker 2: in the world, they wouldn't even lose a minute's sleep.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are not Pfizer, we are a separate company.\n\nSpeaker 2: We are score blue, we sell through Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we would lose a lot of money\n\nSpeaker 2: if we were throwing free pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm not telling you to throw it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just, if you wanna do it free\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're depending on me not to cancel to make money.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm hoping that if you, since I am a client,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you wanna give them to me where\n\nSpeaker 2: it's not gonna automatically renew and I'll try it\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I will turn it on if I like it, that's one thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: But to have to commit to letting it turn on automatically,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't wanna do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I understand your issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm already a client.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not like you're doing anything for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: The ones you sent me don't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I appreciate the offer that you're giving me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it's a good offer.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'd just rather not worry\n\nSpeaker 1: about having to cancel again later.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you don't use them often enough,\n\nSpeaker 2: then that might be an issue for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The average person that's ordering Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think, would use 10 pills in five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't understand. That's about right, easily.\n\nSpeaker 2: Easily, that's, so it's more than a fair offer.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's not that it's not fair.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't wanna be responsible to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I totally understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you know where to find us in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can always call us at this number\n\nSpeaker 2: if you need anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, your script is canceled,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just made a note that you denied the free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I have my confirmation number, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: So we don't have those,\n\nSpeaker 2: but your script is definitely canceled,\n\nSpeaker 1: when these calls are recorded, and I'm-\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
