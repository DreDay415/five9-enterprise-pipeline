    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jim Stack, S-T-A-C-K. Olivia, I've already asked for this to be stopped once and I want it stopped again. I don't want it. So they've been sending it to me and they've been charging me. One of them they started before but didn't send it to me, so please stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: You need an RX number?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need the phone number associated with the prescription. 425-864-1732.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1732. Okay, James, and what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-27-49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said 10-27-49 or 9-27?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-27-49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one moment. Okay, great. Yeah, and you're located at 2747 North 97th Drive, Fiora, Arizona?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then, you could. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'll do that but just don't send me anymore. I don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. I already talked to somebody once and I didn't get it for like a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just looked back at my charge records. It was 113 something I think for a month ago and this month it was in January,\n\nSpeaker 1: December.\n\nSpeaker 2: I look back in November it was 113 something and this is only the third one I've ever received and I called them the time that I got the second one and said stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, I placed your prescription on hold. Yeah, if you need anything before the end of July just give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you won't receive anything and I'm sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day, James. Thank you.",
