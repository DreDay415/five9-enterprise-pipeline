    "text": "Speaker 1: Charles, my name is Darren. I'm on the scoreblue.com website with my account logged in and all.\n\nSpeaker 2: That, but I don't see any more. I just received a second shipment and I wasn't aware I'd get\n\nSpeaker 1: a second one and my card would be charged, but I guess it was on a three-month recurring\n\nSpeaker 2: charge in a new shipment, which I was unaware of. That's okay, but I just want to cancel\n\nSpeaker 1: for any future charges and shipments. I don't need that many. Can I just put everything\n\nSpeaker 2: just on hold for future stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. If you'd like, I can hold everything from now until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What happens in July? I'll just start\n\nSpeaker 1: it up again. It wouldn't come monthly or bi-monthly or tri-monthly. It'll only be once\n\nSpeaker 2: a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. This one came three months from the\n\nSpeaker 2: first one. I thought it was just a one-time thing until I needed more, but okay. Let's\n\nSpeaker 1: see. From now until July, I can make sure we don't\n\nSpeaker 2: charge you or send you anything. After July, one would come for the year. I can drop that\n\nSpeaker 1: down to 10 or 25 pills if you'd like, and then after that, it wouldn't come any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll still have too many for sure after the second shipment, but go ahead and put everything\n\nSpeaker 1: on hold until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. If I need to make any changes upcoming closer to that date, then I can call again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. We're very customer-friendly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but put it on, if nothing, if I don't\n\nSpeaker 1: call, but put it on once a year, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you put it on that if the July one? If I don't\n\nSpeaker 1: call and notify anything before July, then just go July and then nothing, like just once\n\nSpeaker 2: a year, unless I change it down the road from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do I need to do anything or do you need to know my name or account number or is my phone\n\nSpeaker 2: number logged in?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. I got you in South Jordan, Utah. You\n\nSpeaker 2: are good to go, brother. I hope you have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yep. Put it for July and I'll tell further notice and for once a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Okay. Hey, thank you much. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. Take care.",
