How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to cancel the prescription right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay Samuel, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 7-20-67.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And you're located at 68 Prillman Drive, Collinsville, Virginia, 24078?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah, so I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you don't want to receive those monthly ongoing refills, you certainly don't have to with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that works is when you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So yeah, if you need anything before August, just let us know and otherwise your prescription is placed on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty Sam, I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
