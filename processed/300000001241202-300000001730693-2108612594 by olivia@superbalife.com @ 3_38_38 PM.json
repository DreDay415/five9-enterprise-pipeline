    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is William Saunders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, William. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm getting ready to have surgery and I want to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay, William, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: August 9, 1952.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. There we go. And you're located at 536 Ogden Lane, San Antonio, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular monthly refills with the prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let's do that. We'll put it on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Yeah, so if you need anything before August, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, wonderful. Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, William. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
