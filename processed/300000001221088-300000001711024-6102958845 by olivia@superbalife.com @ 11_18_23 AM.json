How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. Thank you for asking. How can I help you today, Brad?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would just call to cancel my order so that it doesn't keep renewing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay. What is your date of birth, Brad?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-23-70.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 450 Innsbrook Drive, Lee Heighton, Pennsylvania, 1-8-2-3-5?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah, so I do see you here. Yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: those monthly refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you wanted to place it on hold today,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's fine. And if you did need anything or need to order anything before July 28th, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you are ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, for now I just want to, because I got plenty of them, so I don't need any.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want them to keep coming, in other words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally. Yeah, completely understandable.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so yeah, your prescription is on hold, but if you need anything in the next six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: like I mentioned, or before July 28th, just give us a call at this number,\n\nSpeaker 1: Monday through Friday, 8-5 Pacific. We're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Brad. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you too. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
