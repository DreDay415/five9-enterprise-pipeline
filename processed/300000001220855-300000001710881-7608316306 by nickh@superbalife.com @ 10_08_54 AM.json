    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to cancel my account at this time. It referred me to this number that I needed—\n\nSpeaker 1: to call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, due to HIPAA laws, they require confirmation of identity. I apologize for—\n\nSpeaker 1: the inconvenience, but we can absolutely get this handled for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Sir, can I get your full name and date of birth under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Carl with a K, last name of Murashima, M-U-R-A-S-H-I-M-A. And you said birthday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-23-55.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you, sir. I'm looking at your script here. It looks like it's for the 20—\n\nSpeaker 2: milligram Cialis, quantity of 12 each fulfillment, originally written, looks like, on October—\n\nSpeaker 1: 31st. Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. It looks like the doctor wrote it with refills. That's why you saw—\n\nSpeaker 2: this most recent one go through in January. All right. Now, Carl, you're not required—\n\nSpeaker 1: or obligated to do this monthly or, in this case, tri-monthly. This is a prescription—\n\nSpeaker 2: not a subscription, so you're not obligated to do it every month to keep it active. If—\n\nSpeaker 1: you wanted, you could keep it active and simply pause it, and that would allow you to call—\n\nSpeaker 2: in and place orders as needed in the future, because it does appear you have about 10 refills—\n\nSpeaker 1: left under the script.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. We can go ahead and just pause it for an unknown period of time—\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead of canceling altogether.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when I need it, you said I can just contact your company again and have to do it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, exactly. Just if you want to place an order, make sure you call us before August—\n\nSpeaker 2: 1st, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. You're all set, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, great. Thank you very much for your time and your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Happy to help. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
