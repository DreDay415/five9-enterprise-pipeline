    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. I ordered in the past like a certain type of prescription, and I wanted to try the new AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can help you out, Rob. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. It's 4-6-1970.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer. And do you want to try out the new AGB?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right now, you can get a quantity of 10 for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then we have a quantity of 25 for $113.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: and a quantity of 10 for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I tried to order it online because they had a deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you order 15, you get 15 free.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they just kept on sending me to my dashboard and not allowing me to order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's not allowing. Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I don't know why that's happening, but I can take your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: So quantity of 10 is $49, and then the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that's why it comes out to $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then a quantity of 25 is $99 with a processing fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: It comes out to $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then a quantity of 10 is $49 with a processing fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: It comes out to $62.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So basically, you don't get any free over the phone?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, because we have to pay the doctor's fees.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So did you say 25 is $113?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll try that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Are you going to let – go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. These are supposed to be better than the other ones?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. So it's Pfizer's latest formula of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: A lot of people say the generics stop working for them because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: your body gets used to medication after a certain point.\n\nSpeaker 2: And AGV, they're getting really great results.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Are you still at 10-314 South Kominsky Ave, Apartment 1C?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: GV, quantity 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are we still using your MasterCard ending in 7011?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. That went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I noticed you were paused for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and pause you again for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: But just remember, every time you call in for a refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: some people don't look that you are paused for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you place a refill, it automatically goes back to every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just whenever you call in, just remind them to go ahead\n\nSpeaker 2: and pause it again for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have you paused until August 11th.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll be shipping it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long does it take to get?\n\nSpeaker 1: It ships out from Kentucky, so you'll get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
