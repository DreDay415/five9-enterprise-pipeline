I ordered the, uh, Viagra generic once, and they sent me another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Gerald Sparling.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your zip code, Gerald?\n\nSpeaker 2: 93536.\n\nSpeaker 1: Lancaster?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. So I do see the doctor did, um, write the prescription with refills for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want it every month, I can change that frequency for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, yes. Take it off.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you don't want it at all?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But I, I will do that, but I need to let you know, when I do that, it will cancel out the prescription, so it won't be available any longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's understood. You wouldn't be able to call back, too?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Then we're all set, Gerald. I took care of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
