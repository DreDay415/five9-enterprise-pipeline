No, it was 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me do my due diligence, and we'll make it right, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you only got 10, then we will reverse something for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just know that, again, we're Americans, and we're not here to take advantage of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're here to take care of your vitality, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I'd known it was $63.95, I'd have never ordered it, period.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because that's too much money.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We want to honor our baby boomers.\n\nSpeaker 2: We want to honor the men that's come before us.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, there's a lot of veterans here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm a veteran, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we always want to do what's great and what's honorable, because we're Americans,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's how we roll.\n\nSpeaker 1: But so just hold your line, and I'll make it right for you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Allow me to do my good work for you, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: You bet, Mr. Butts.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stand by.\n\nSpeaker 1: About three minutes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
