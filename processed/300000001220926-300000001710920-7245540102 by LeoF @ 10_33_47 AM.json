    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Eric Temple. I ordered a couple, I don't know, a week ago, I ordered the new Viagra AGV or whatever, and I ordered 25 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was cleared and everything. Well, here it came today, and it's seletafil, and it wasn't Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you gotten to try that out yet, Mr. Temple? Have you given it a shot?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't. I just got it today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so technically the name of the medication is seletafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: The markings that you should see on those pills, they should have a 100 on one side, it should be blank on the other side, and you should see an AGV indication on the label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give it a shot, Mr. Temple. You should see those results really quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: As little as 11 minutes, a lot of guys are saying between 10 and 25 minutes, they're seeing results.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, AGV does stand for Authorized Generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: The important thing isn't that seletafil name, even the branded blue Viagra, the main active ingredient is seletafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: The important thing is the manufacturer that it comes from.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is that newest pill that we promised you, as long as those markings do correspond to what I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it does say that, but the only thing is, my doctor, my urologist, described me seletafil, and it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have to have the full, you know, I have a prescription for Viagra, but I wanted to try to, it says, you know, your false advertising, it said Viagra ADV or whatever that said.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's what I paid for.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is the Viagra ADV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's what it says on my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not false advertising, Mr. Temple.\n\nSpeaker 2: That pill that you get from your urologist, it's named seletafil, but it's not the same pill that we carry.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes from a different place.\n\nSpeaker 2: That pill's not FDA regulated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those could come from India, China, Mexico, who knows where.\n\nSpeaker 2: The government doesn't oversee those pills, so they could come from anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 1: This pill that we have, the important thing, like I said, is the manufacturer that it comes from.\n\nSpeaker 2: So all generic Viagra's named seletafil, no matter where you get it from, but most likely all these companies, our company, that company, doctor in Texas, doctor in San Diego, doctor in, you know, Philadelphia, they all get their pills sourced from whatever, you know, company is, you know, going in there and trying to sell them to them, whatever they choose.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we get ours, the one that you got from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it is the correct pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do think you'll be very impressed.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if it doesn't work, I'm going to get the right, you're going to send me what I paid for?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that is what you did pay for, that AGV pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is our AGV pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it doesn't work, call us back, and you can send it back for your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that, if it has those markings, that is the correct pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you guys, do you not, but you cannot sell the Viagra branded that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we do have branded Viagra as well, but what it is, is the company Pfizer makes that pill Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's still Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just name it Viagra because that's the brand name.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like your Pepsi versus your RC.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pepsi is the Viagra, RC is the other one, but it's all still Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the AGV is the newest pill from Pfizer, but it just happens to be their generic,\n\nSpeaker 1: which that's the only pill that they make other than their blue pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Same facility, same manufacturers, same scientists, it's just a better pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's cheaper and it works faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give it a try. If you don't like it, call us back.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, we'll try it some more. We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, perfect. All right, Mr. Temple, thank you.",
