How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Richard Steiner and I actually signed up for that Score Blue account back in October.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it in November. I cancelled it in December and then I see they charged my account in January again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can pull up your account here but I think I know what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: Due to HIPAA laws you are required to just call and confirm your date of birth and identity.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can do that right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did that in December. I thought they actually sent me a form.\n\nSpeaker 2: You called?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me double check here. Could I just get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Richard Steiner, July 9, 1962.\n\nSpeaker 2: On my end I do see you sent an email request but then they should have replied back with the requirement to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we can take care of this now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I actually had an email that said you're all set because I asked her so I don't have to do anything more.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I did call too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this prescription was for the 50 mg Viagra AGV, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you signed up, you did sign up during a promotional period, Richard.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're actually not required or obligated to get this monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted to continue access to the prescription you could just simply pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I can go ahead and cancel this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So upon cancellation this prescription is officially closed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any future prescriptions would require a new health survey, consultation and approval by doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you accept those terms?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm still going to be charged for January's?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, sir, that has already been shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, you can return that for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've got to pay for shipping?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just simply put return to sender on that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I haven't received it yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just looks like the order was placed on the 24th and it was shipped out yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you should get a tracking number here soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
