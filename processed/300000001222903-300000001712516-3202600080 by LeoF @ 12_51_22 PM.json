You said Ken Gunderson?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's see here. I have the information up here, Mr. Gunderson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I've been on your website, and I read through everything,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't see nothing saying that they made a generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you get an order recently?\n\nSpeaker 2: About a couple weeks ago, but it said generic on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that AGB pill is generic. That's what that stands for,\n\nSpeaker 2: authorized generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What it is is that's the generic pill from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's their newest pill from the people who make the blue pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's what that is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then why on the website, the pill or the bottle is nothing the same?\n\nSpeaker 1: One says, you know, real Viagra AGB, and this one just says generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: So on the pill bottle, you should see the AGB indication,\n\nSpeaker 1: but not the actual pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just for, like, marketing for the website.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you should see on the pills is 50 on one side and blank on the other side.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we can't put that blue coating.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we can't put that blue coating on the white pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you know, they say it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't work, or it doesn't work for me or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're not getting any results at all?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: How many have you tried?\n\nSpeaker 1: Six so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: And have you taken two at once?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what happened then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it might not be a fit.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I could say for you, Mr. Gunderson, is that we do have a multivitamin we like to send out.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'd like, I can send you that multivitamin since you have 25 of those pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I would say is take that for 10 days, then give the Viagra another shot.\n\nSpeaker 2: What it is, it's a detox pill, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will undo, unclear, unclog any blockages you may have down there,\n\nSpeaker 2: preventing the medication from working.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could be built up for a long time, you know, anything that's preventing it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so if you wanted, I mean, since you have the pills, I could send that out to you at no cost, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take that for 10 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give the Viagra another shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll see where we are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, I guess I will try, but I got nothing to lose.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Leo, Mr. Gunderson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a call back after you're done with that if it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ask for me, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have an extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, it's zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait, let me get a pen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get a pen.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's zero, zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three, two.\n\nSpeaker 2: Three, two.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I put that in the phone, it should come up the, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so look out for that to come out early next week, Mr. Gunderson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take this multivitamin as directed and then we'll go from there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Give it 10 days after you try it and then we'll see how we do again with the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, bye-bye now.",
