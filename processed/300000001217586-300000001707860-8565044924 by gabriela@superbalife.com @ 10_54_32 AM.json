    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, this is Joseph Yates, and I need to cancel my prescription with y'all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Joseph, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 03-01-1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what's the reason? What's going on? Is it that you have enough supply at this time?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to cancel it, please, as soon as possible. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because what I can go ahead and do for you, Joseph, is that I can go ahead and just pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you get a break and you're not being charged for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'll just cancel it right now, Miss, because I'm going through financial difficulties.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to make no mistakes. Just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally understandable.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the reason why I'm giving you the option to pause it, Joseph, is because we are the only company in the U.S.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which sells FDA-approved Viagra, so our supply is on high demand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you cancel, that means that you cancel the prescription and the doctor visit,\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're not able to reorder with us in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, if you decide to pause it, then, you know, you take a break.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, of course, if you need any pills before that time, you can always call to reorder or to extend your pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: Miss, just cancel it. I'm fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you're all set, okay? Have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so you said I'm canceling.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't I have to send you an e-mail or something saying that I just canceled?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the reason why we have a customer service, and so I am confirming with you that it's been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm saying, but don't you send me an e-mail telling me it's been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm giving you a verbal confirmation that it's been canceled,\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can also go online and see that your prescription has been canceled moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day, Joseph. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye.",
