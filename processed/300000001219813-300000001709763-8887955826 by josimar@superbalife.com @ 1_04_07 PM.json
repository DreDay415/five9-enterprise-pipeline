    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, sir. My name is Billy Davis and I ordered your product of Sildenafil and I didn't know\n\nSpeaker 2: this was the original stuff with all the horrendous side effects and I am very sensitive to blood\n\nSpeaker 1: pressure stuff. And when I ordered this, I had no idea I was being put on. I always thought\n\nSpeaker 2: it was a scholarship program and y'all did not tell me that. And I got a second shipment\n\nSpeaker 1: of this and I have never even used any of the first one. And I need to send this second\n\nSpeaker 2: one back. This product would just be too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your last name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Davis 39759.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's your first name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Billy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. 205 Arrow Drive, Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I pulled you up here. So I do want to mention, sir, that they do list that in the\n\nSpeaker 1: terminal condition in the email that's sent to you. That's where it tells you how this\n\nSpeaker 2: is through Pfizer. So they do have a refill date to become active, the prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Aside from that, you're more than welcome to send it back to the refund. I can email\n\nSpeaker 2: you the return instructions. But I do want to mention that when we do cancel these orders,\n\nSpeaker 1: it does eliminate the prescriptions. So you wouldn't have to worry about receiving any\n\nSpeaker 2: other orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, well, I definitely need to cancel and I need to send this second order\n\nSpeaker 2: back. It is unopened.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, it's completely sealed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you could definitely just write refuse slash return to sender. It's the easiest way to have it sent back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do I need a number or something like that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, just write that on there and leave it in the mailbox or take it to the post office. It'll go back to our pharmacy and they'll give you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I want to put a certified mail or a shipping number or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you don't need it when you refuse the package the way I'm letting you know. All you need to do is write that and turn it in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm not guaranteed it'll get there, though. I just want something.\n\nSpeaker 2: The tracking number that you got for the email,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's the same one they're going to use to ship it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: The tracking number in the email?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the one that they emailed to you when you first made your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, gosh. I don't know if I can retrieve that or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you should be able to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, anyway, we'll... But other than that, you should just write that on there. It'll go back\n\nSpeaker 1: and then they'll give you the refund. They don't have a problem with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, please do cancel these other shipments. They should have told me that when I made the first order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you did this online. They send you that information right before you press the submit part. But just go ahead and send it back and you'll be able to get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good one. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
