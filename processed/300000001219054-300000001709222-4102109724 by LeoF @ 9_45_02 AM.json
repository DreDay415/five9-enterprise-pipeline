    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I received a refill prescription through Score Blue and I'm trying to find out something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Has something changed with the prescription? What was your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Benjamin. Spell it for me, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: B-E-N-N-A-M-A-N. Raymond?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And what, are you like seeing different markings on the pills or what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't see anything that should have been different. What is the...\n\nSpeaker 1: Different markings. It used to be, I guess you can see what I'm getting, what am I getting there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you should just be getting our generic Viagra the whole time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so what's changed is I used to get it and it used to have just a 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now it says AC 3440 and it doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: When did you see that switch happen?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I just renewed this within the past two months, but when I used to get it, it used to say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now it says AC...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I get you. You know what? I really couldn't say, Mr. Benjamin, what I would imagine is happening\n\nSpeaker 1: if you're seeing different markings on the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I mean by I can't say is I just wasn't here in 2022,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm not sure who the manufacturer of the medication was,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the manufacturer has probably switched since you started back in 2025.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure we still carry that other version, but you probably just got something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, so the previous pills worked for you, these ones didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the previous ones worked. The 100s that I used to get worked, and like I said, these didn't do nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: And did you want to try to see about getting that old pill again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if I could get the old ones again, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I think we still do have those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the problem is, it's like I've gotten two months of these and they're no good to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would I do send them back to you or do you guys credit me or do anything for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do if you want, I can send you a replacement order out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you 10 of these other pills to see if you do like them,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then if you do, we can go from there. We can switch the prescription over for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, so when can you do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do that for you today, Mr. Benneman, that's no issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, like I said, the ones that said 100 on them worked. These ones here do nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm going to take care of this for you. We'll give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Benneman, I'm going to send these pills out. You'll see them come back at the end of the week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see how we do, okay? Let's see how you like them, and then if they're similar to the old ones,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's the same manufacturer, but I'm going to send them.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll do a little trial and error. I'm not going to charge you for them, and we'll see how we do, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, who am I speaking with?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Leo, L-E-O.\n\nSpeaker 1: L-E-O, and do you have an extension or anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0032.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0032, okay. Oh, so you can do that for me. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Yep, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you, sir, and have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too. Bye-bye.",
