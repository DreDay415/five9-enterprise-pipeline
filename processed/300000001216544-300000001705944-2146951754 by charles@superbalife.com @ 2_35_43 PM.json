I sent an email out, I guess it was about a week, week and a half ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I got a response from Tamara. I had purchased 40 tabs of the – oh, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it didn't work. Nothing worked. And she had mentioned that maybe we need to try something different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, okay. Yeah, if you're interested, we are with Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: If these pills, Ronald, didn't do the trick for you, they didn't give you the kick that you were looking for,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can send you a different variation of the Viagra EGV that's manufactured in the France factory from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a lot more potent. I don't know if you know anything about Viagra, but it did come from France and Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're getting it directly from the motherland.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can send you out those pills completely for free as a replacement for these that you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Keep those, trash them, do whatever you want to do with them. I'll send these as replacements.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then call us back and let us know what your future needs would be.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the difference in them?\n\nSpeaker 1: One is made in America, and one is made in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's really just different formulas from the two, but they're both from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So one is just a lot more potent because it's obviously over the pond.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I bet my buck that you're really going to like this one a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sounds good. I'll shoot pharmacy notice right now, and then we'll get them sent out immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd expect them by maybe Wednesday or Thursday of next week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Ron, I hope you have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
