    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, sir. Can you hear me? Barely. Okay. Let me get you out of here where it's less noisy.\n\nSpeaker 2: How about now? That's much better. Thank you. Yes, sir. I was going to change my prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: to your ADV formula that I saw, but whenever I use the website, it takes me to my portal\n\nSpeaker 2: page, and it's not one of the options. Not a problem. Okay. All right. I was able to\n\nSpeaker 1: pull you up by your phone number. This is David I'm speaking to. Yes, sir. All right,\n\nSpeaker 2: David. I just want to confirm your shipping address is still the same, 1026 Ponte Vidal\n\nSpeaker 1: Avenue? Yes, Couliston, Florida, 3344. All right. All right. So I see that you were getting\n\nSpeaker 2: the Viagra 100 milligrams, the 12 of them? Yes. On the ADV, they come in three orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, you'd be better off with the, because you're getting 12, we have an order of 10 or 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is the 10? The 10 total actually would be $63.95,\n\nSpeaker 1: as it includes shipping and that. So the actual bill's $49, but it includes shipping. It'll be a\n\nSpeaker 2: total of $63.95. And then for 20, is it a little bit of a discount? 25? Yes. It's $25,999.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And now what's the dosing on that one? You had 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can keep the same 100 milligrams. That's not a problem. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Did you want me to go ahead and get the order sent out today for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine. I can take it. I'm pretty sure I need to update my credit card information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I think we can do that as well. Well, you know what? Try to run it. Actually,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that one would work. And you said 10. I'm sorry. I just want to confirm. Did you want\n\nSpeaker 1: to go with the 10 or the 25? The 25, the $99. Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. It looks like that you have your mailman's address, and it did go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: So again, the actual total is going to be $113.95 with the shipping and handling charges, but\n\nSpeaker 2: that order has been placed. And you should be receiving that within the next several weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay? Yes, sir. And that's the new ABB formula, correct? That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Okay. Yeah, that's right. You were looking at the three-month offer\n\nSpeaker 1: that you were doing last time with the 10. Would that still work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Three months is still fine. Okay, great. So we'll keep it at that. All right. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Okay. Have a good day. Oh, by the way, just so you know, when you get the bills,\n\nSpeaker 2: they're going to look very similar to what you've been receiving, but the difference is they're going\n\nSpeaker 1: to have the number 1-0-0 on the back. That's how you can tell them it's different. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Got you. 1-0-0. And you know what? While I'm thinking about it, can you go ahead and change\n\nSpeaker 1: that to a six-month on it, if you're in the system, instead of a three? I can do five.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or five. Perfect. All right. Not a problem. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Okay. Have a good one. You too. Bye-bye.",
