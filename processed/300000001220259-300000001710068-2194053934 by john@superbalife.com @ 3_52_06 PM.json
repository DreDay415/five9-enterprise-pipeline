How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I put in an order just a few minutes ago, but I want to add express shipping, the one-day shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, I can definitely do that for you. I'm sure you understand, but this will go out tomorrow to arrive on Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, as long as I get it Thursday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because it's just too late in the day for it to ship today, so it would ship tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But I can add that for you if you still want to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay, just need your name and zip code, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Joe Glusak, G-L-U-S-A-K. You mean where it's getting delivered to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Either zip code will work. If you have a different billing, either one works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's got my – the shipping information is 46368.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Joe Glusak.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Joe. One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, 6625 Daniel Burnham Drive, Suite D.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and I'm good to charge $38 with the card on file?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'll get it there Thursday, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that'll be the next day option.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Just so you know, for the future, I understand when you can go online and order is the time you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the cutoff is at 1 p.m. Eastern time to get it out that same day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we're all set now.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Joe. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
