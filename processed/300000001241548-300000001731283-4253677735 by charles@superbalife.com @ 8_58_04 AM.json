    "text": "Speaker 1: Charles, my name is Cary Goodwin. I have a subscription I'd like to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Cary Goodwin, Lake Stevens, Washington. Correct. All right. Okay, Cary, it does look like you are a VIP member here. I'm assuming you're just overstock at this point, don't need the pills as often as every month?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, actually, they don't work for me, so I don't want to use them anymore. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. They don't do anything even when you take them with no alcohol and on an empty stomach?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct. Dang it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we are with Pfizer, Cary, so it's always very disappointing when our product isn't taking a positive effect on somebody. If you are still looking for something to give you that kick, I don't want to sell you anything whatsoever. We are with Pfizer, so we do have a different version of the Viagra AGV that's made in our France factory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. If you'd like, I can message my pharmacy right now and have them send you over 10 free pills to try completely for free, complimentary.\n\nSpeaker 2: If these ones take a better effect on you, call us back and let us know how we can accommodate with them and then set up a better refill schedule that fits the bill for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would be interested in that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sounds good. So I'll message my pharmacy right now. I'll see if I can throw in some express shipping as well. I would assume maybe by Wednesday or Thursday of next week, no later. And then these pills that you're looking for, they will have the number 100 pressed onto them like a stamp.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. If they do work, then I can just call you to get more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was just about to give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 0040.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, very good. What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles. Okay, great. Charles, thank you very much. Pleasure talking to you, Kerry. Hope you have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
