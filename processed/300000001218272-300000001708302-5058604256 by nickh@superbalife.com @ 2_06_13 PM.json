And do you want me to run the same card we have on file?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You can erase that because I've deleted that card.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty. I can take the new card from you then when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: PO Box 4037-6627-6963-0340, expiration 1-30.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the three-digit security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0-1-6.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can put this through for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Wells, that went through and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.
