    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, why are you charging $99 a pill? $99 a pill? Well, that's what your online thing says.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for ours, we do charge about $100 per pill, about $99. Those are for our branded blue Viagra pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those come like directly from the source, so we don't get a discount on any of that or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why they're so expensive. So that's from a nuclear power plant?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I can get Viagra at 100 milligrams for 70 cents.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's like that's the reason for the call. It's like, yeah, are you having a second month? We sell other things as well, you know, but that's the branded one.\n\nSpeaker 2: We just can't give a discount. It's like when you get a prescription from the doctor, they sell you the generic pill because it's so much cheaper.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just branding, you know. It's like designer clothes versus like regular, you know, stuff you buy like at TJ Maxx.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you've answered my question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, thank you.",
