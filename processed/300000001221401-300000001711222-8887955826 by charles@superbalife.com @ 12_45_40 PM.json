This is Stephen Mansfield.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have an old prescription that says discard August 13, 2025.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you probably have me as an account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can give you whatever information you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to start the prescription again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I have your phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. It's 617-851-6467.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And you're in Hanover, Massachusetts, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I'm in Hanover.

And you need a new order?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need a new prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was wondering, because I am getting older,\n\nSpeaker 2: if I can have more than 20 milligrams per tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't do more than 20 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if you want, I can have the doctor call you\n\nSpeaker 1: so that you're able to ask him those type of questions\n\nSpeaker 2: and be able to double up on a couple of the pills maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not a licensed physician,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I wouldn't be able to tell you yes or no\n\nSpeaker 2: without any type of knowledge like that, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So then I feel 20 milligrams generic, 150 pills, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just see what I had here last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Quantity. Let's see if it has the quantity here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that what it was, 150 last time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, 150, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I did take five, it says it could take up to five.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be 30 times, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that will last, okay, what does that last, about a year?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What does that cost?\n\nSpeaker 1: Total cost is $149, with taxes and everything, about $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, the only thing I'm thinking is,\n\nSpeaker 2: for now, can I get 75 pills instead of 150?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second lowest I can go down to for this type of order is 30 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so you only have two preferences.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Checking the deals right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We could do the 72 pills for, what is that, $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: $99.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why don't I try that first?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: 72 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you probably need a new credit card, maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a MasterCard ending in 8306.\n\nSpeaker 2: That expires on 10 of 27.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if that's still a good card to process on or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a good card.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm surprised.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a good card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure how we have it, but we have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, apartment 1209, 80 Mill Street, Hanover, Massachusetts, 02339, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Processing right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, everything went through, Stephen, so I'd expect everything to arrive.\n\nSpeaker 1: The weather's crazy right now, so it's kind of really hard to determine how soon everything will be there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd expect maybe Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you going to have the doctor call me, too?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just so that you can ask him whatever you need to ask him.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: What should I be looking for when he calls?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I get a lot of scam calls.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Honestly, I don't know what their area code will be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be within the next either today or tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds good, Charles.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, Stephen.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
