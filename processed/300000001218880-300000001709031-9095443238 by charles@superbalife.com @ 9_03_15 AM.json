    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi there. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Doing good. How about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. Let me get you off the speaker there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I have an account with you guys, and I ordered with ScoreBlue,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I ordered one prescription, and I'm dissatisfied with it,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I want to make sure that you guys don't send me any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Understood. I got John Powers in Rockwall, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Were the pills just not effective?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did they give you side effects, or what happened with it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they were – it's just Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been using Sildenafil for several years.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was under the impression this was something different,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's the same product, so it doesn't work for me any better\n\nSpeaker 2: or any worse than what I've already been using,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can get it for $10 from my HMO,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I don't need to spend $70 for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. So with our pills, our pills are FDA-approved with Pfizer, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So Sildenafil is an active ingredient in any Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't matter where you get it from.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sildenafil is always going to be in it because it's an active ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you tried the pills, though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: They didn't work any better or any worse for me than the others.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Especially on the 11-minute, you know, working in 11 minutes kind of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That didn't happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, we are with Pfizer, John,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it's always disappointing when we hear that our product isn't taking its full effect like it should.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if need be, I mean, we are with Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, we do have another variation of the Viagra AGV made in our France factory.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you'd like, I don't want to sell it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to make sure you have a pleasant experience with us and leave no stone unturned.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you a sample completely for free of 10 pills of the Viagra AGV that's made in our France factory.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can almost guarantee you're going to like this one a lot better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anybody I send it to, they almost call back within a couple of weeks asking for a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can send it to you for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me back at 0040.\n\nSpeaker 1: You won't have to hear that terrible elevator music anymore, and you'll just go directly to my queue,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we'll talk about future accommodations for your future refills with the pill I send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what I'm trying to do right now, you guys, do you have these set up on an automatic refill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Negative.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pump the brakes on sending you anything for the next four or five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you've got time to try the one that I send you, and then call me back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me know what the future deal is with the refills and when you need it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't go.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going, are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just back up a little bit here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you guys have me on an automatic refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: On an automatic refill?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a prescription refill, correct, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your next one wasn't due until it looks like March.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I definitely want you to remove me from that and go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to ask you to go ahead and close out my account\n\nSpeaker 1: and don't send me any refills, don't send me any samples, don't send me any products at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty then.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do appreciate your offer.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right then, John.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, wait, wait.\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I know that you've canceled my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you an email and you can also see it online.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, and I'll let the credit card company know as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let them know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not to accept any more bills from you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That happens sometimes where, you know, you're doing your job and then somebody drops the ball\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you wind up getting billed for another prescription or whatever that you didn't want.\n\nSpeaker 2: I always double down on this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: But thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do appreciate your time, and again, I do appreciate the offer.\n\nSpeaker 2: You seem like a very nice guy.\n\nSpeaker 1: But cancel everything, and I'll look forward to getting that email.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hope you have a great day, John.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.",
