I'm calling to put my order in for another strip.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I want to know that y'all have any bargaining of sales going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can I get your name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's Robert Kilpatrick, 46222.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Silver Maple Court?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can get you a refill. I don't have any deals on it, though. It would be the same price you've been paying.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's for the generic, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You were getting the AGV the last couple times, the newer one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Is it the card that ends in 6044 or a different card?\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Just let me know when you're ready because I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, go for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: More light.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be 5360, 6291, 3557, 2542.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1130.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 608.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be 809. I had it upside down.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you had it right. It went through, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we're okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much did it cost?\n\nSpeaker 2: So same thing you've gotten the last, like, four times. 163.95 is the price on this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome, Robert.
