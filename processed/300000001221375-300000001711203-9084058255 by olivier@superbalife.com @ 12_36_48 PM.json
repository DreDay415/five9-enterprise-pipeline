    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, how are you doing, Viagra? This is Mike Avellino calling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Mr. Avellino. How may I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my prescriptions. They're not really doing anything for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, really? Is this your first time taking... I see that you have 10 tablets, Viagra, 50 mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And you always have that reaction, it never really worked?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you try Cialis in the past? Was Cialis better help for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I tried different things with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, like, I mean, at first they were working and I was having no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now they just kind of like dull out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have tried Cialis before?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Was it better than Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not really. I kind of had the same action as getting the one that had both in it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the combo as well as going to Givis anymore was working for me better.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, I take two of those pills, try and it'll start and then it just doesn't stay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So maybe you would be better on a daily Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: So micro-dosing, taking on a daily as a supplement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if you say you have result, that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's like maybe you don't have enough juice because you just take it as you go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe you have a system, your biochemistry, the body needs to have it in a system.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, constantly like filled up and then when you want to perform it,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to get activated. I don't know if you see what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: You could do that. You could do Cialis daily maybe.\n\nSpeaker 2: That could be maybe better. You can try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe your system tends to be slow after when you just want to activate,\n\nSpeaker 2: when you want to perform, it doesn't pick up right away or, you know, stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So...\n\nSpeaker 2: How much does that cost?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see. Let me check for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That could be a trial solution.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because, you know, with ED, you kind of have to check a little bit\n\nSpeaker 2: and find what is your best bet basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for 30 pills, so that's a one-month supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's $90.\n\nSpeaker 1: Five milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take it once a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Every day is a daily.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, because Cialis works a little different than Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, to resolve the issue, you kind of want to find out\n\nSpeaker 2: which one works better with your body chemistry.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the good thing is Cialis, you can get it as a daily so it stays in your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the good part. You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it builds up, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It works with prostate a little bit as well, which Viagra don't do, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'll give that one a try. I'll give it a try doing that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Let's see. And observe closely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Observe it closely and see if you get a better reaction.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if it's not right away as good as you want, but see if there is a difference\n\nSpeaker 1: so we know we're going in the right direction.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Yeah, but I don't think that's much more than what I'm spending now on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see. Yeah, because you get 30 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now you're ordering 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're ordering 10 pills, 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: This one you're getting 30 pills for the whole month and you take it every day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. All right. Can I switch to that then? I'll give that a shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll see how that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Let's see if that works.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then if you see that, oh, it seems like you're helping me,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're just going to have to keep getting mostly like on a daily, you know, 5 mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: That could be a better help.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the physician is going to write you a new prescription in a few hours, of course,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I got to request a new prescription because we cannot use the Viagra one\n\nSpeaker 2: to provide you Cialis. They're two different medicines.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to get you a new consultation and as soon as it's written,\n\nSpeaker 2: the doctor is going to send that to the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two to five business days you will receive it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The shipping address 24 Byron Road, North Brunswick, New Jersey is good?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. So I'm proceeding right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So I was able to get you your 30 pills for Cialis 5 mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep in mind, if that works for you, okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: I would advise that you get the 90-day supply, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: When you figure it out if that's good, you get the 90-day supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why? Because that's going to save you more money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you're going to get total 90 pills for $1.99, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's going to save you some money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead of paying a single price for each one,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can save as well by getting 90-day supply at the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the option you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you prefer just the monthly, that's good as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, try it first.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have 5 mg, one tablet every day,\n\nSpeaker 2: and see at the end of the month if you feel like you're loaded.\n\nSpeaker 1: You feel like you get better erection like that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you're loaded after 30 days, 20, 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will feel like, you know, the medicine sits well with you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So pretty much when I get this then,\n\nSpeaker 1: don't go to use my other pills, just use that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Use that because one of the things,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if you're using those FDA-rejected pills in the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: The issue with those is that they might get you a result,\n\nSpeaker 1: but they mess you up as well where nothing is going to work, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they're compounding medication with other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you get that's called blue is FDA-approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: There is no compounding.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's natural med from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, everything is premium.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's clean, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The other stuff are different filler to make things work that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can't even name.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's good to give you an erection here and there,\n\nSpeaker 1: but in the future nothing is going to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Keep that in mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why the FDA can't even approve them\n\nSpeaker 2: because they have a long-term potential issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'll give it a shot with the daily one.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's probably one of the few things,\n\nSpeaker 1: one of the only things I haven't done yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Let's try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know how you work, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for now, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Bye-bye.",
