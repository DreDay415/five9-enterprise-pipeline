    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing? Good, thank you for asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. I need to cancel getting any more of the Scor-Blue, at least until further notice.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got so much now, I can't use this in three years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, sure. Mr. Gregory Crane?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you have a prescription from Dr. Supa for Viagra, 50 mg, 10 tablets, every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can tell the pharmacy to stop the 30 days and pause the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think they pause it to lock your pricing, I think, up to half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't get it on a monthly anymore, but you can get it once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, just let me do this. Let me call you when I run out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got the number. Just cancel. Don't send me any more. I don't need any. I got plenty.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I got you. I got you. You don't need to send yourself if you don't need it, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I was saying, for you to reorder, you got to have the doctor prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: because if you lose that, when you reorder, price will be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: They got to reinvest. So what I was trying to do is advise the pharmacy to pause up to half a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: so there is no more monthly moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even after a year, don't send me any.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to have to just cancel everything then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because what they do, they require to get just a refill once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't need it, that's fine. I'm just going to cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I've done this before. I've had to cancel before because I got so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I keep getting so much, I can't use it. So just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it's twice as much next time, it'll just be twice as much. I'll understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. Yes, sir. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
