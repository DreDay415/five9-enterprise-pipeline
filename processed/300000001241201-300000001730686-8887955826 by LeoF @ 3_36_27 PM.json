    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is John Brennan calling about what y'all sent a script out for on me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did an application and stuff with y'all for the new Viagra, not for a generic Viagra to DeltaFed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So why do I have your friend here when I'm talking to y'all?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can find out for you. I can look into this for you. If you got the wrong thing, it's not correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: We will make this right for you, sir. What's your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Brennan, B-R-A-N-N-O-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: I could have gotten this generic Viagra from my PCP, but y'all are supposed to be the only place that has this here new AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code, Mr. Brennan?\n\nSpeaker 2: 80916.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you might have gotten the wrong thing. Do you have those pills there with you, Mr. Brennan?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just got them out of the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please open them up for me and let me know what the markings on the pills say.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think you might have gotten the wrong thing. I think you might be right about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, I definitely am going to send you out a replacement if that's the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stat.\n\nSpeaker 1: The marking says AC33B.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so that definitely is wrong, Mr. Brennan. You're right about that. I'm really sorry about that mix-up.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are machine-filled, so robots handle half of this process.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I will definitely do for you is send you out a replacement order of the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: How soon can you get this for me, sir? I'm supposed to be leaving town on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll ship it out today. I'll overnight it to you. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll overnight it to you. I'll get it out as soon as possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, Mr. Brennan. So I'll have that tracking for you by tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do I do with these?\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep them if you want. They're just generic Viagra. They are still generic Viagra, but you don't have to keep them if you don't want.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't need to send them back, though, or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So they should be to me tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And it's the new Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the markings on the pills will be different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What should the markings say on them?\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll say 100 on one side, and they'll be blank on the other side, and they'll have the AGV indication on the label as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: What milligram?\n\nSpeaker 1: Same milligram, 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: 25. Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because above 25, I'll get the side effects, blurry vision and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we don't want that. No worries. So this will be sent out quickly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
