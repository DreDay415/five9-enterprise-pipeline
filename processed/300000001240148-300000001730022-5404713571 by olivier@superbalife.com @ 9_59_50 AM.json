I'm trying to cancel my prescription for Scorblue.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not working for me and I've got too many of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me pull your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have the number. I'm in West Virginia right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I called last night and left you a message.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's fine. I found you. Mr. Michael Thomas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I see your prescription for Viagra and tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that your first – I have a couple of questions for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've taken them before. They're just not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: They usually – when you take Viagra, usually you don't get results.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: They tell me take one tablet before sex and they're just not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what I'm saying is before the Viagra you took, you had the same outcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't really working as well before when you took it, before that order with Scorblue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Was that for something else?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm saying that you say you took Viagra before in the past, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Before ordering with Scorblue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I guess they're about the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Was it working? Same? About the same?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, about – I don't know. It's about the same result.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, so I'm going to cancel – what I'm going to do, I'm going to cancel the Viagra prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you like, I'm going to send you four pills of Cialis, which is a different one,\n\nSpeaker 2: because sometimes Viagra is not for everybody.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: I know Viagra is a superstar. Everybody wants it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But there is the two major ones is Viagra or Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Cialis –\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm getting a 10-milligram prescription every three months from them,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I don't know who to call.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got to look at the bottle and see who to call to cancel them.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's just 10-milligram, they don't work. It has to be a stronger dose.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get you 20-milligram. That's the sample I want to send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If 20-milligram is better, you call me, you tell me, hey, you know, 20-milligram was better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to keep that as my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to cancel the Viagra one, send you four of this Cialis, 20-milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then in the future, if Cialis is good, what you can even do, you can do the daily Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 1: meaning that it stays in your system, it loads you up over time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe your system is slow, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it loads you up.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's an option you have with Cialis that Viagra doesn't offer.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pretty sure I've got one a day Cialis with somebody else, and they're 10-milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: They didn't work, and they keep out of refund, but it does not be your company that's doing it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me try your 20-milligram, and I'll cancel the ones they sent me, and we'll see how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could be better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I owe you anything?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's sourced between the U.S. and France here, but a lot of companies come from China or India.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the quality sometimes is not really there.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's something we found out too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I owe you anything for those four?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you a sample, and then I'm going to cancel the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the doctor obviously legally is going to write a new prescription for Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm going to post that prescription so you can call me and tell me, hey, that actually worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: That helped me better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Send that to me maybe every 90 days, every 60 days, whatever the case may be that you think you might need, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your account will be paused.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you the Cialis, and I'm canceling the Viagra, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully we can get better luck with that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know my girlfriend wants better luck.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.",
