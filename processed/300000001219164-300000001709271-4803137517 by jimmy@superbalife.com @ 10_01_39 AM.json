    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Jimmy. You guys are affiliated with the DuckyMD, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. We're familiar with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I normally get Cialis from those guys, and I was trying to get some of the generic Viagra from them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this was the support number. I filled out the change of request deal, but it wouldn't let me continue through that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was just wondering if you might be able to help me out with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It looks like you did try to go with the Viagra. Give me one second. Yeah, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: So are you guys the same people that do the SCORE Blue AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, we are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So is DuckyMD like an affiliate-traded company of your guys's?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is. Basically, so I can help you with that. I see that you did go ahead and try to go ahead and get the Viagra, the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can go ahead and try to – you want to try the AGV. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what this would be, the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you said what you pushed in was generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the AGV is generic also, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's a new and improved generic. It's not the regular generic Viagra that you've been out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's a much better Viagra as far as that's concerned. It works faster, lasts longer, and it doesn't have those same side effects that a lot of the other people would get with the other generic Viagra like the headache and the dizziness.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And whatever it is, maybe as far as those type of things. So it's the latest and greatest new improved Viagra that's made from Pfizer. That's what the AGV is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Correct. And I've done some research on that on the Internet and stuff like that, and that was of interest. I didn't know – so you can't order off the DuckyMD website where I have, like, my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: You need to call right now, but I do have your information up right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dan, you're at 94 East Oakland Street, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I do have your –\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my billing address. I have a different shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a P.O. Box. P.O. Box 148?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can see that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you want to –\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I wanted to – so how does that work? Can I do a one-time purchase, or is this an auto-ship thing? I don't want to get into an auto-ship if I don't have to, if I don't like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me tell you how it works. The AGV has to have a prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: For sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Prescriptions do have refills connected to them.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you, I can set you up for, like, have it set up for, like, three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will give you more than enough time to try to see if you like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And within that three-month period, if you want to order more before then, you can call and order before then.\n\nSpeaker 2: If three months is too soon, you can always call and push it back as far as that's concerned as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it gives you, you know, more control of the account that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can set it up for you that way rather than just having it sent to you every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how is this DuckyMD generic Cialis thing working?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that – I think I did a one-time purchase on that, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it looks like that you did it – that was on the 12-29, but that would have shipped you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that has you set up for the three months since you had 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Does that auto-ship in 90 days, or how does that work?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's how the prescriptions work.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same scenario of 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Cialis is something that you take every day, so that would have been sent to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm not planning on mixing these two together.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I do an ADV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you did the Viagra, the Cialis program is no longer in effect.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Cialis program is no longer in effect as of right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if I switched it back or what.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how many pills – can you do a one-month subscription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, one month is – like right now, I had you set up with the pharmacy, what you did online.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got a better deal that I'm going to work out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You had four pills for $54.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to get you 10 for $63.95, and that's usually a one-month supply, which is 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you can get up to 25 for $99.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I recommend – and like you said, you want to try it for the first time,\n\nSpeaker 1: go with the 10 for the $63.95 and go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can try and see how it works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure you're going to appreciate this Viagra because, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: again, it's the latest and greatest, best Viagra out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's the new and improved AGV Viagra, which is – it is the generic Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: because the real Viagra still costs like $100 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is just as good as the best.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's made by the same company, Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pfizer labs in France, but they last longer, they work stronger,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they don't have the same side effects that people got even from the big blue pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the blue pill just really died, believe it or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same product, but it just died blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: So some people are just used to the old stuff, and they want to – you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: sometimes you can buy a piece of bread and it costs $5\n\nSpeaker 1: and buy another bread for $20 and you think your bread is tasting better\n\nSpeaker 2: because you paid $20 for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's how the human mind works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So is the AGV the newer one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that a combination between Solutafil and Tadalafil?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's its own separation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is made of Solutafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing that Viagra's made it with is just improvements on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, it's just improvements that have it work faster, last longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and not the same side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's how it's going to come.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would be able to tell the difference by the actual pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to have the number 100 on the back of the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you're going to know it's AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I got 10 pills a month, is it shipped monthly or every three months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I could set it up for you for every three months,\n\nSpeaker 2: but usually it's shipped every month unless you have the capability of pushing it\n\nSpeaker 1: out rather than, you know, because some people don't, unfortunately,\n\nSpeaker 2: they don't have six that make the head off in every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't use it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to be able to use 10 in a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's my point.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can push it out to, like, three months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if three months even comes too soon, you can just call them,\n\nSpeaker 1: like you're doing now, and say, hey, I still got two or three left,\n\nSpeaker 2: push you back another few months, and we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the good thing about that, if you need them before then,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can always call and say, hey, I want another order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it will come to you sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, that's the advantage of doing it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's 10 pills for three months?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm going to set you up for as far as right now, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be more reasonable.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 10 per month is just going to be way too much,\n\nSpeaker 1: but 10 for three months, that would be more like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll try that new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'm going to do, because you already processed 5,495 on your card,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to just – I'm going to delete that first order,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to do this order for the difference of the 6,395.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense to you what I'm trying to tell you on that one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't even know that other one went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it did.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, if you want to delete that, then let's just go with the new AGV plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to see an additional charge of $9.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to see a charge of 5,495.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the one you had and an additional $9\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's the one I'm changing the prescription to the AGV for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'd like to try the new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I know it's actually the new AGV and just not some generic?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to have the number 100 on the back of the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be the same Y-shaped diamond pill, but it's going to have the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send me the good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's nice not to have some of that nasal stuffiness and stuff if that helps with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm getting this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just going like standard shipping, isn't it, to my P.O. Box?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you send like an e-mail receipt or something probably?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, once the pharmacy gets it set up for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me put you on one hook because I'm having a little trouble because that other one is still out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: So give me one second to get that switched over for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
