    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Jessie, can I please get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, my first name is Joseph, my last name is Forensky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect, thank you so much for returning my call, Mr. Forensky.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we were just reaching out because we had received an e-mail from you\n\nSpeaker 1: regarding a not so satisfactory interaction, and I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me a little bit about it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, what happened was I called the number and stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I got this gentleman right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said his name was Tom in the end, but he was so nasty,\n\nSpeaker 2: I would doubt he actually gave me the real name.\n\nSpeaker 1: I go, hey, I was looking to find out what's going on with my pills I ordered and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered them, and it's been like a week, and then it says it's 24 hours,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're just shipping now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was asking him, he goes, look.\n\nSpeaker 1: He told me, he goes, look, you know, if you're going to be nasty with me,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just going to hang up with you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I go, look, I'm just asking you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he just got straight up, he was just nasty the whole time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had to almost like walk on pins and needles to try to find out what was going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he goes, he finally, he goes, well, you know, he's trying to explain to me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm like, look, I just want to know what's happening.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got to the point where I'm just like, look, let me speak to your supervisor.\n\nSpeaker 1: He goes, all our supervisors are gone.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's an hour until we close, and all our supervisors have left already.\n\nSpeaker 1: They won't talk to you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he goes, if you want to try to call back tomorrow, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm like, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why, and then I tried to call back immediately, and no one would answer.\n\nSpeaker 1: They probably saw my phone number and said, no, don't answer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I let it ring for about 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: No one answered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so that's why I sent you an email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm so, so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll pull up the call and have a supervisor review it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That really isn't how that should have gone down, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm very, very sorry about that experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm happy to go over the order with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, did you at least get an answer after the fact?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or it doesn't sound like you did.\n\nSpeaker 1: He tried to explain it.\n\nSpeaker 2: He goes, well, you know, you ordered it on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're closed over the weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it's a holiday on the other day, on the Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they're not even going to ship it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they shipped it 24 hours after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm like, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I told them, I go, look, it's supposed to be shipped within 24 hours of when I purchased it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You took out my money right away.\n\nSpeaker 2: You had no problem taking my money.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he goes, and he just kind of said, forget it.\n\nSpeaker 2: He just kind of stopped it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm so, so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me see what we can do here for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was so discouraging.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, right off the bat, just nasty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right off the bat, I'm like, oh, my God, I've never had a customer service.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I work in the customer service industry.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I have never, never, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's definitely uncalled for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this here, well, it is about to be delivered tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, again, I apologize for that delay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It did kind of hit the cusp of the weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually the pharmacy ships stuff out the following day.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure with the holiday being Monday, obviously that impacted shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: He even told me, don't ever plan on seeing it before the 26th.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm like, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, what?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, according to the postal service, it's due to be delivered tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, would you like me to text it to you so you have it handy?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I'm so sorry about that, Mr. Korensky.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is due to be delivered tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is what the – that's what it shows here on the U.S. Postal Service's website.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're following the tracking here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will definitely look into this.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, thank you for letting us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's things like this that, you know, you can only do so much with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It really gives you a bad name because, I mean, seriously, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to make sure you guys don't have a recurring charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't want to – I'm not going to order again after this.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, that's all I've said.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, even if it works really good, I'm going to probably not order again.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I totally understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, again, I'm so sorry about that experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, if you do, you know, plan to place an order, we'd love to make it up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, at least do our best to try to make it better the next time around, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
