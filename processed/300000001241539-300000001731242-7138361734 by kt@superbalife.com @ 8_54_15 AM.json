    "text": "Speaker 1: Perfect, Leon. Thanks for holding, bud. So I did exactly what you wanted, bud. I put\n\nSpeaker 2: a stop to any and all monthly refills and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I made note and I sent a message to the doctor because of the financial hardship and\n\nSpeaker 2: I made note of that. So just remember my extension at 0037, bud. And then I did make it where\n\nSpeaker 1: no matter what, you can use that button to click it. Okay, bud? Just in the future when\n\nSpeaker 2: things go good, if you need it in three months, four months, because I know that you're going\n\nSpeaker 1: to come across a winning lottery ticket, you're going to be able to order whatever you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if I had a button that you can click that says quick girlfriend during financial hard\n\nSpeaker 1: times, I would put that button there for you too. So she could just finish you off, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know how we roll, bud, in Texas, you know, you got to look out for each other. So as\n\nSpeaker 1: long as you, you know, as you recover, call me at 0037 and know that you'll always have\n\nSpeaker 2: access to the 50 milligrams of 10 quantity, which is minimum of two refills a year. Right,\n\nSpeaker 1: bud? You're good to go. All right. And you'll recover.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So, so I'm good to go. So it's canceled. So I had to worry about future payments\n\nSpeaker 1: coming out, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I did is I set it up where you have two refills a year in the future, right? So\n\nSpeaker 1: that way, when you recover, you have time, right? About six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. But going, right. But going forward as of today is canceled, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. So if I delete the prescription, bud, you won't have access to that. That's what\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to say.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm saying. Right now, slow down. Right now, I need you to cancel financially.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel. And when I feel like it's time, then I will just go back in.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I get it, bud. And I did that right now. I'll put a stop to this and cancel it. Just\n\nSpeaker 2: know that you won't have access. If you call back of the 50 milligrams, maybe we'll try\n\nSpeaker 1: something else out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but for right now, right now, business is business. Financially, you just cancel\n\nSpeaker 1: everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, bud, you got to eat first, bud. You got to take care of your loved ones, bud. So we're\n\nSpeaker 1: Americans, but we look out for you. And we know that you're recovering. Just call me\n\nSpeaker 2: if you need anything. But I did cancel it in its entirety. You won't be able to get\n\nSpeaker 1: the 50 milligrams again when you call back because we're all sold out for the next six\n\nSpeaker 2: months. But if you recover before then, let me know and we'll do something about it. We'll\n\nSpeaker 1: figure something out.\n\nSpeaker 2: But get back on your feet, bud. Hold on tight and keep that chest up. And just, I pray for\n\nSpeaker 1: you, Mark 1124, whatever it is that you believe, when you ask, when you pray, believe that\n\nSpeaker 2: you receive them and you'll get them in Jesus' mighty name. All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, bud. That's how we roll, bud. I got to do it, man. All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care of you. You as well, bud. No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
