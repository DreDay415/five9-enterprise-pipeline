    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I wanted to refill a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that, sir. What is your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Scruggs, S-C-R-U-G-G-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your zip code, Mr. Scruggs?\n\nSpeaker 2: 90740.\n\nSpeaker 1: 90740, give me just a sec. Scott. All right, you've got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Scott, it looks like you got the 10 pills of the new Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want to just do that same order again, or do you want to get more or less? Or not less, but more?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you refresh my memory on how much they are?\n\nSpeaker 2: You got 10 pills for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you were at 25 pills, which is just the next quantity up, it'd be $113.95. $50 more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and do you have any military—\n\nSpeaker 1: Pricing or discounts? Unfortunately, not. Currently, we definitely do appreciate that service, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, I always ask. You never know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it normal, and I'm driving down the coast, so if it's garbled, let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it normal to just take one pill or two pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: You got a 50 milligram option, so it's just up to you, really.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people, I mean, the doctor doesn't want anyone taking more than a 100—\n\nSpeaker 1: But they say you can take one or two. Some people split them in half, too, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's just really how much you need. Everybody's bioavailability is a little different.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you say split them in half, you could even take less than one?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, if it works, yeah. It just depends how much you need, you know. If 25 milligrams works, that's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some people, they want the 50 milligram, they get the 100, and they just split them in half, you know, twice as many.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I got you. All right, let's go with the second quantity that you mentioned.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you're at 4181 Ironwood Avenue, Seal Beach, 90740?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and it's shipped discreetly, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is, yeah, absolutely. Just your name will be on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, Scott, I have your Discover card here that ends at 2747. Is that the card you wanted to use?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, give me just a sec.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you're all set, Mr. Scruggs. Your order's been placed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see that process ship out and arrive in the next few days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
