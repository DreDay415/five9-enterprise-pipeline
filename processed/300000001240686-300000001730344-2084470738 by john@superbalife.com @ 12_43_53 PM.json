    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling, this is John. How can I help you today? Yeah? How you doing today? I'm doing well. How about you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good. I'm a quick question, so I was trying to\n\nSpeaker 1: suspend or skip my\n\nSpeaker 2: my next delivery, and I can't see how to do that on the app.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I can help you, sir. I just need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sabino Papas Adaro, and the zip code is 83646.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Sabino. One second, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Saguaro Hills Place.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, how long do you want to pause it for? I can put a pause on it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what the thing is, so here's my issue: I'm not seeing the benefits. It's like I'm taking nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know. I don't know what the deal is. I don't know if it's just a defect in the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know, is that common?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's sometimes it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I wouldn't say common, but sometimes it does happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're taking on an empty stomach, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no, I mean sometimes I take it at night.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so do I need to be taking it during the day or no?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can take it at night, but food and alcohol will interact with it and make it not work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you're taking it right after you've eaten a meal or something, that may be part of the issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what's the best time to take it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean the best time to take it is before having sex.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just are going to have to plan around the meal thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the one kind of frustrating part about Viagra is that you have to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you would just take it before you're gonna have sex. You don't take it like hours before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, so like if meal, so would you consider like an empty stomach would be like a couple hours after a meal or?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean if you give it a few hours after a meal, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't have to be like you haven't eaten all day.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you need to be at least a little bit removed from the meal and have it start to digest a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. Would you have a recommendation on how long that would be? Because I feel like I've taken it in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've taken it in the morning on an empty stomach and\n\nSpeaker 2: Again, just to feel like, you know, I'm taking nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two to three hours is usually fine in that regard.\n\nSpeaker 2: So and then how long before I engage? How long before I engage, like a half hour or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so that's going to be dependent on how it reacts to your body.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it could be a half hour.\n\nSpeaker 1: But basically once you've taken it and you start to get aroused, you should notice you're going to get an erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not long after. The one other thing I was going to say is\n\nSpeaker 1: I just have a slightly different version if you want to try that as like a sample and see if it works better for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And to see if maybe that's an issue because we have two different manufacturers of our Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's two different kinds we have, so I can send you the other one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can send me the other one. I mean, I wouldn't mind trying it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll send it. This is a one-time courtesy to send this out for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be ten pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know how it goes, and then I'll put a hold on your account for three months just to give you time to\n\nSpeaker 1: try it and let us know what you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that sounds good. All right. Thanks, Sabino.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's the new one you're sending me? It's still Viagra. It's just a stronger, more effective dosing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So hopefully this works better for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have a lot of people that have switched from what you're taking to this, and it's night and day difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 'cause that was the one that was supposed to be—I mean, that's this one, that this one here.\n\nSpeaker 1: This was supposed to be like the new and approved, wasn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, unless you can tell me what's written on your pill, I wouldn't know for certain.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here, I could tell you it's white.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, this one's white too. Yeah, but the stamp on the pill will actually tell me for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No, that's the regular one. So I'm fixing it. You're going to get the better one now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll try that out and then I put a hold on everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because that's what I—so that's made a little more fresh because that's what I had ordered was the new 80.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's a new AG or something like that, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, sir. Somehow it didn't go through that way when you put in the order, so I don't know what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't go through that way, so I do apologize.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try these out and call us back and use my extension 0026 if you do like them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be able to work with you to get something figured out for the other orders and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that sounds good. Okay, so you're sending that out then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm sending that out, and again, just like I said, my extension\n\nSpeaker 2: 0026. You'll get right back to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, is that complimentary or I gotta pay for that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, this is complimentary this time to see how it works for you, and assuming these are better.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I was saying. Call me back and then we'll figure out a way to kind of make up for the other orders\n\nSpeaker 2: that were screwed up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds great. I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
