    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: David Cooper.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And Mr. Cooper, what's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, 78935.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Are you at 302 Center Street in Columbus, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Allerton, Texas. They're making a mistake. It's A-L-L-E-Y-T-O-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, Columbus is what's listed here, so that's...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know. That's why it keeps going all over the world.\n\nSpeaker 1: Going all over the world. Okay, let me just go ahead and change that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are they right next to each other, Allerton and Columbus?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm tracking this thing, and it's all over the world. That is back in Cincinnati.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no. Let me go ahead and have it reshipped for you. Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been a whole month and a half, almost, for me receiving this product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, January.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, we'll have it reshipped to you at no cost to you, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 1: The name of the town is Allerton, A-L-L-E-Y-T-O-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got that. So I have 302 Center Street, Allerton, A-L-L-E-Y-T-O-N, Texas, 78934.\n\nSpeaker 1: 35, 78935.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, well, that's probably why.\n\nSpeaker 1: The zip code will be reflected in the city and state.\n\nSpeaker 2: So were you the one who entered that address?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I explained it to you a week or so ago. Is that the same thing I'm telling you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because this order was not placed by a person over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, we could see who placed it. This was done online.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we'll go ahead and have it reshipped to 302 Center Street, Alleytown, Texas, 78935.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the address that we got was the address that was placed at the time that it was done online.\n\nSpeaker 2: But no problem. We'll just go ahead and have it reshipped to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know how long it would take to get here?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what? We'll ask them to ship it with priority.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even though it wasn't our fault, we'll just go ahead and do that for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So that would take another day, week, or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Three days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Bye-bye.",
