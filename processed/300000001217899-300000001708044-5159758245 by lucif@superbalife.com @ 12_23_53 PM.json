It doesn't have to be, sir. It's totally up to you. Let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I know, but you've got options.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we don't choose it either way, sir. We just provide the options for you to choose, and if you don't, then it will go out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know how the doctor writes it, but it's totally up to you, as I say, that you can choose how you want it to come out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I want to cancel it completely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you don't want to order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean? That would be, you know, you would order when you call in for your orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's when you would receive anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, I don't want to receive them anymore. I want to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any particular reason why?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't want it. You know, Viagra, it just doesn't make me feel right. I get headaches.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, if it's giving you headaches. I mean, this medication is really subject to body chemistry, and we do have other Viagras.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, now, listen to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, sir, stop. I just want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you listen to me? I heard you the first time. I'm just doing my job.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, then cancel my order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can help you, okay? So calm down and let me talk. I wasn't talking over you. I let you talk.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know you want to cancel. I hear you loud and clear.\n\nSpeaker 2: Probably how you ended up getting this the second time anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't want it.",
