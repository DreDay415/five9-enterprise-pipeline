    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at SCOREblue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just got done placing an order for SCOREblue, and I had received an actual email\n\nSpeaker 1: that's saying I was going to get a $15 discount if I just clicked on this link,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I didn't finish the process yesterday. So they sent me an email saying I was going to get\n\nSpeaker 1: a $15 discount when I clicked on that link. And at that time, I was going to –\n\nSpeaker 2: originally, I was supposed to be charged like $99, and I find out there's a $14.95 processing fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't – when I went through the whole process, I ended up still getting charged $113.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it should have been $84 plus $14.95. And I guess I want my credit card to be –\n\nSpeaker 1: to receive a, you know, a refund of $15, I guess is what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, so I'm assuming the coupon that you had was to waive the pharmacy fee,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is the $14.95. Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. They just said $15 off. It didn't say what it was going to be for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because the total – so let me pull up your account here and see what you ordered first.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Full name is Scott Verplug, and date of birth is July 9, 1957.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So yeah, so it looks here that you ordered the quantity of 25 of the 100 mg Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: That price starting out is $99. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then you have the pharmacy fee, which is essentially just them writing the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: there in Kentucky. All right? So what that $15 coupon does is void that pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want, I can just go ahead and refund you that $15 right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so your charge on the account would just be $99, or a little less than $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I guess I could accept that. I guess the only thing I have a problem with is\n\nSpeaker 2: nothing is said anywhere in your advertising or marketing that says anything about\n\nSpeaker 1: a $14.95 lab processing fee or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it said grand total, $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I expected the $15 off on the email that I had received.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Scott, what I mean, like I said, what I can do here is I can cancel this order altogether\n\nSpeaker 1: because the order – I don't love our website.\n\nSpeaker 2: To be honest, this is a little bit of a dated system that we use,\n\nSpeaker 1: and most of our patients are calling in for orders anyways.\n\nSpeaker 2: I apologize for any confusion.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I can give you the coupon.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know, honestly, which coupon you're referring to\n\nSpeaker 1: because I am kind of just – I'm trusting you on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't recall of any current deals like that on our website.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you want, I can waive the pharmacy fee for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah. Well, that's supposedly okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can either cancel it, or I can cancel it for you because you did just place it,\n\nSpeaker 2: or I can waive that pharmacy fee and give you the $15 discount that you're telling me about.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't even know a coupon that we have for $15 off right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it wasn't really a coupon as much as it was an email that I received\n\nSpeaker 1: that they were going to give me a $15 credit\n\nSpeaker 2: because they thought there was some problem with the website or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was some data, which doesn't mean anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it was an email that had a link on there that I could finish my visit\n\nSpeaker 1: if I just clicked on this link and I would receive $15 off.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when it all was said and done, I still got charged $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't – nothing – anyway, I don't need to go into all the detail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give me the – yeah, the credit or whatever back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let me go ahead into the system, and I'll do that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I've got one other question, too, once you get that taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And did you attempt to do PayPal first, right, and then you did a MasterCard ending in 6513?\n\nSpeaker 1: I attempted to do PayPal first, and that's when I noticed, well, it's $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I thought, what the heck's going on there?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I kind of backed out of that, and I ended up just using a credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I made it or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll work out, but I still didn't end up doing anything different.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if the initial charge was on PayPal, you would have seen this refund immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to issue this refund now for the MasterCard.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could be two to five business days when you'll see that on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you want to log into your account for any future orders,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can always switch it back to PayPal.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that way – I always recommend that with patients\n\nSpeaker 2: just because it's a little bit more streamlined with charges and refunds.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm issuing that refund right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: giving you $15 back on the MasterCard ending in 6513, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so that's been completed.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what else can I help you with, Scott?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, okay, is this going to be an auto-ship again as far as,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay, after a certain period of time,\n\nSpeaker 2: there's going to be an actual automatic shipment again?\n\nSpeaker 1: So this prescription is not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some patients do adjust the refill schedule based on their needs, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So for convenience, they might have a refill every one month, two months, three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is not required to keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, you could put a pause on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as two orders are placed each year, your prescription remains active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, when I go in there, it mentions – it says, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra 100 milligram three times.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has in parentheses, you know, 3X.\n\nSpeaker 1: So does that mean they're going to fill this thing three times\n\nSpeaker 2: or three months in a row or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just noted on how many refills you currently have.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you don't want those immediately, what I recommend is we put your account on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I noticed I went in there, and there was a selection, I think,\n\nSpeaker 2: under the support page, and you go in there,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I don't see anything that really talked about how I could even pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just gave me –\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, our website is not great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you know, we try – most of our patients are doing orders over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: All this can be done over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can even give you extensions so they can skip lines, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: when you have an account with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But unfortunately, that website I'm not a big fan of.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I can do this all for you over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why don't you put a pause on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'll still get this initial order, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, that order was placed on the 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then let's put a pause on it, and then you give me an extension number,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then when I want to refill it, then I'll just call you and do it over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't want any surprises.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I want to try it out first, you know, see what I think.\n\nSpeaker 2: And hopefully everything works like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, everything on this prescription thing all works okay, and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: then I'll place an order when I'm ready to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Again, I'll just do it by phone, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just find notes here on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's been adjusted.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, Scott, if you want, I can give you my extension so you can call me\n\nSpeaker 2: directly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0042.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's so you'd call the 800 number that ends in 9807,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then your extension is 0042?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your name is what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've been very helpful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And always keep in mind that you can, if your prescription is a little, say,\n\nSpeaker 2: the milligram dosage a little high, things like that, we can always adjust it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're interested in Cialis, we sell that as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell name brand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So everything is adjustable here.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you ever have any questions, don't, don't, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I'd much rather you call me and we get this handled instead of\n\nSpeaker 2: having issues on the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, appreciate that, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for all your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you get a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
