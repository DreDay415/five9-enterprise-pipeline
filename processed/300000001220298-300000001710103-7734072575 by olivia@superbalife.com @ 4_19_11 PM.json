    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, good evening, my name is Derrick Leonard.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Derrick, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm fine, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to get a refill with my, I don't know how many\n\nSpeaker 2: refills it'd be about, I don't even remember, but anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would like to get a refill please, if I'm not too soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think so though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what is your date of birth, Derrick?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's March 8th, 1957.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, so you just want to do the 150 pills of Sildenafil?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, that's the only, what else do you all have?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's about it, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that's about it too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, as far as like really good deals, I mean for Sildenafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is Viagra adjacent, then yeah, that's the best deal by a\n\nSpeaker 1: whole lot, and that order, because it's so large, it gives\n\nSpeaker 2: you the opportunity to do the once annual one-time order, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I think it's a good place to stay for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, are you still located at 352 West 92nd Street,\n\nSpeaker 1: Chicago, Illinois, 60620?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I am, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is the card, is the visa that ends in 0758, is that an\n\nSpeaker 1: acceptable form of payment?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is, uh-huh, yes, it is, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, so I'm going to place that refill for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course, and usually I'd say it'll be out to you by the\n\nSpeaker 2: end of the week, but you know, that winter and ice storm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, with the weather, yeah, okay, well, I hope that it'll\n\nSpeaker 2: get here by the end of the week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where are you all at?\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you all out east or west?\n\nSpeaker 1: Where?\n\nSpeaker 2: So we are very lucky this week, we are in Santa Monica.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, I bet, yeah, okay, okay, okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's going on in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Cold, real cold, very cold.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's always cold up there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not really, in the summertime it's not bad, but in the\n\nSpeaker 2: wintertime, you know, we get it, you know, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've never been in the summer, I would love to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went to Chicago, I went once, it's very alive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: In a really nice way, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty cool, yeah, I guess, I wish I was there where\n\nSpeaker 2: you all at, what is it now, about 60 or 70 there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's pull it up on the old weather app right now and I'll\n\nSpeaker 2: tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it's 65 here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and it's 68 in the rest of L.A.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so, I see, because I got a nephew that stays down\n\nSpeaker 2: there in Phoenix down there and it's about in the 60, it's\n\nSpeaker 1: probably about the same, you all are probably about the same,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, so, yeah, I still wish I was there, really, because\n\nSpeaker 1: that weather is nice like all year round, except, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: maybe in the summertime it gets warmer, but I could go for that,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's a great, I mean, Los Angeles is a great place for a\n\nSpeaker 2: lot of different things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you know where to find us, Derek, if you ever need\n\nSpeaker 1: anything in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, these should be out to you really soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, good, good, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I would say I would pay extra to get them, but the thing\n\nSpeaker 2: about it is I still might wouldn't get them, what do you think?\n\nSpeaker 1: You might be right with the weather.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because a few men this week have tried to receive theirs earlier and\n\nSpeaker 2: sometimes when we do express shipping, it gives people more trouble\n\nSpeaker 1: than it's worth.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, right, right, I could imagine that, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll just leave it on just the regular, you know, whatever it is\n\nSpeaker 2: that you use, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we'll probably send it tomorrow, so it'll probably get to you\n\nSpeaker 2: by Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, that's cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm not in that big of a hurry, really.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not raising that much sand, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So whenever I get it, it's cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So thank you so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Derek.\n\nSpeaker 2: We appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate you, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too, hon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
