There is no package yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: April 18, 1969.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I just pulled the tracking. It says it was delivered on January 26 in your mailbox at 1:48 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is nothing there in my mailbox. Mailbox is 2015.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me confirm your address. I have 6300 Northwest, 5 Way, Suite 2050, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33309.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. I have not received nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. I'll send you out a replacement. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says 6301 Northwest Way, 5th Way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have 6300 Northwest. Let me just correct your address because it's 6300 Northwest.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no. 6301 Northwest, 5th Way, Suite 2050, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33309.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and 5th is the number or do I spell it out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Say that again?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5th Way, is it just the number 5 or do I spell it out?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you have to put 5th Way, Suite 2050.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5th or T as in Tom, H?\n\nSpeaker 1: T like Tango, H like Hotel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. Yeah, that's what I have. Okay, Way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Way, Suite 2050.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. That's what was wrong. We have the wrong address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's 6301 Northwest, 5th Way, Suite 2050, Fort Lauderdale, 33309.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, let me update that and then let me update your billing as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what happened. I have the wrong address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they'll be shipping that out to you today, so you'll definitely receive this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Five days or less? Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle. Okay, Michelle. Thank you. I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.",
