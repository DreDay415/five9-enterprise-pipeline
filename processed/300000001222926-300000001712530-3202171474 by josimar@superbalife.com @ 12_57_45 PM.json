    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I wonder if I could upgrade my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Pacelli with a P, and the zip code is 14468.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I pulled you up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, when you mean upgrade, do you want to go to the AGV Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. So, since you've been a long-term customer of us, you can get it at the promotional rates.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's $40 at $163, $25 at $113, and our smallest package is $10 for $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: How many do I get per month now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, right now you're getting 8 per month, and right now the AGV is on a promotional rate.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you give me, what were the options again? Could you run that by me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. 10 pills for $63, 25 pills for $113, and 40 pills for $163.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can I get 25?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that's per month. That's per month, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: The 25 count is going to be a little bit longer. It'll be like 5 to 6 weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 10 count is the one that they do per month, but it's usually the better deal. We go for 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And it's going to 125 Curtis Road, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty. And just to confirm, the Discover card that ends in 9590, is that okay for the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, you're all set, sir. The order has been placed. Actually, give me one moment. I don't know why this was added to the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm going to have to put you on a brief hold. I have to modify something on your account just to make sure it gets done correctly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
