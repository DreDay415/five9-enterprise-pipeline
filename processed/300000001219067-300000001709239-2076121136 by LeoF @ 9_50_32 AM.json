That's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you out. That's no problem. Have you placed an order with us before?\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: John L. White. You've got all the information, but I don't know where to go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you place an order, Mr. White.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the smallest you have is 10 pills for $63.95. Do you want to do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95 for 10 pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can do that. How long will it take them to get here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Three to five days, but the doctor has to speak with you on the phone before we send the medicine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you okay for a phone call from the doctor?\n\nSpeaker 2: From a doctor?\n\nSpeaker 1: From our doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I am. Yeah, your doctor for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Are you at 93 Chapman, what is that, Road, Athens, Maine? 04912?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is. It is.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a visa that ends in 5883. Is that the card you wanted to use?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that again?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a visa that ends in 5883. Is that the card you wanted to use?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5883, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. I'm going to place this order for you. I'm going to have the doctor give you a call today, so just look out for that, okay, John, in the next hour or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: A doctor's call in the next hour or so?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, maybe two hours, but just look out for that call today, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
