    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have a pending order, but then I got an email saying that I needed to record a video.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I recorded a video and sent it, but then it said something like—\n\nSpeaker 2: Something about—\n\nSpeaker 1: Going offline or something. I don't know if it took it or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: In the event that it doesn't take it, and in the event that—\n\nSpeaker 1: The—\n\nSpeaker 2: Medical professional, for whatever reason, is not—\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you call it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Grants the prescription. I won't be charged, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you won't. So if they won't approve the order, you're going to get a refund for whatever you paid.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take a look to see if we received that video, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: If not, you can send it to us by text message, which is a lot easier than going through that link.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sherwin, S-H-E-R-W-Y-N, last name Simon, S-I-M-O-N. And your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Two five five five zero. That's three fives and a zero. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we received your video. We received it, so that's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just—let me quickly just make sure that there's audio to it. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, the other thing I wanted to ask you—\n\nSpeaker 1: I got confused on checkout because it said something like if you wanted additional something—\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I said I declined it, then it said if you want additional something—\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm—I must have hit it, yes, or whatever. So, and they're not being 99 went to—\n\nSpeaker 2: $145.\n\nSpeaker 1: With additional, I get, I guess, 25 tabs, but can you confirm the order? I couldn't understand exactly what happened there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it looks like your initial order was for 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it gives you an option to add an additional 12 pills for a discounted price.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that was what was added to your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So 12 pills. So that's for additional—how much? How many dollars?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, for 12 pills you paid an additional twenty-nine dollars and seventy cents.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's a bitch. So that's a total of how many pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: 37.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, at a hundred milligrams. And I think I spoke to one of your colleagues. She said—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can divide them up, you can split them up or break in half or whatever, something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: She said it would—it's a better buy.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then I—one more question. If I would have rejected that, was there another one? Was there like—\n\nSpeaker 2: Another window that would have said—\n\nSpeaker 1: Twelve more pills for like twelve dollars or something like better, but was that the last window? That's a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one you selected is the last window, so you have an option of adding an additional 25 pills or half of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is the 12 pills? Okay, which I did. Okay, very well. All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll just wait for the approval and they'll verify whether it's approved or not, and then we go from there, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, right, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate your—\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, you too.",
