Mr. Joseph Bacchetti?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to cancel my prescription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You need the RX number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, I was able to find you. You have a prescription for Viagra, 50 mg, 10 tablets every 30 days from Dr. Tariq.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need a refill or any health concern?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I really don't need them. I was just experimenting. I just want to see how they work. I don't need them, sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I do, then I'll re-prescribe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, you could pause. I can stop what Dr. Tariq wrote and advise the pharmacy to pause the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're just going to reorder as needed instead because they don't require you to get it every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was just the original prescription from Dr. Tariq, probably because you just got 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can advise the pharmacy so you can just reorder and keep your price point.\n\nSpeaker 1: To keep your price point, you can get once or twice a year your tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me advise the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, Mr. Bacchetti.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I then pause everything for half a year so you can just reorder, okay, and just stop the 30 days tablets, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.",
