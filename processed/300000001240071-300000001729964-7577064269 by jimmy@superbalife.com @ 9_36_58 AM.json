    "text": "Speaker 1: Jimmy, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm calling because I'm not satisfied with your product.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really didn't understand the cost when I purchased it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The thing said it was $49 for 10 pills, I think,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you charged me another $29.40 for another 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you charged me $63.95 for 20 pills that I got\n\nSpeaker 2: and $29.40 for 10 more pills, and I only got 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not satisfied with this product at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not doing me any good, and that was $93\n\nSpeaker 1: and something I spent y'all took for nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me help you out here, David.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see what's going on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that you just recently, when you first ordered the pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: the $49, the actual total, including shipping and handling,\n\nSpeaker 1: is $63.95, first of all.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you did get the extra 10 pills for the $29.40,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that's why you got 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's what's including the extra 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 10 pills by themselves, including shipping, is the actual $63.95,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I see you just got an order shipped to you just recently,\n\nSpeaker 1: but my biggest thing is that you're saying that the pills didn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me tell you what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, they ain't doing no good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I might as well just eat Tic Tac.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, we don't want you to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take care of you, and I'm going to do this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and take care of that order that was just sent out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to get you fixed on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to pull up your information to get that reversed for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, David, this is what I just did for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and I refunded you back that order that was just sent out.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was for that $63.95, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And let me tell you what else I'm going to do to help you out here, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you the correct 20 pills are the ones that are going to\n\nSpeaker 2: definitely work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you got the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you out 20 of these new and improved 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I guarantee you, and it's going to be no charge because you already paid\n\nSpeaker 2: for them, I guarantee you're going to see a drastic difference on the way\n\nSpeaker 1: these are compared to the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to have you set up on any type of automatic monthly issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to give you a chance to try these.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you try these, I can guarantee you you're going to want to order these.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like when you did your order, you did it online when you first did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: When you first placed your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So basically what I'm going to do, I want you to do this for me going forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once I send you this 20 to replace that first batch,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to want to order these again.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't go online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give us a call like you're giving me now when you want to reorder these\n\nSpeaker 2: because if you go online, you're probably going to get the same ones that you\n\nSpeaker 1: don't like compared to these new and improved ones that I'm sending out now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to set you a file to have these when you call in so you're going to\n\nSpeaker 1: get this new version of what I'm sending you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, remember,\n\nSpeaker 1: I just mentioned that the other one was just shipped out to you on the 7th.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not what I'm sending you.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get those, just regard those because those are already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: If the ones that are going to come after those are going to be a white-shaped\n\nSpeaker 1: diamond and there's going to be 20 of them in there because I'm going to\n\nSpeaker 2: replace that first order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's going to be 20 of them in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when you try these, they're going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I guarantee you these are going to work so much better.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to work faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to last longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're going to not give you those side effects that a lot of the other\n\nSpeaker 2: ones might give you like the dizziness and the headaches and the upset.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: I started getting headaches.\n\nSpeaker 1: The ones I'm going to send you with the 100, you won't have that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm trying to tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to take care of that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So remember, you're going to get an order in a few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not the one I'm sending you.\n\nSpeaker 2: My order is going to come after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to go ahead and take care of that for you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: So look forward to about 7 to 10 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Remember, the difference of the pill, again, white-shaped diamond with the\n\nSpeaker 2: number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, David.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they work, I'll definitely call back for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Remember, do me a favor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us rather than going online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Therefore, you know you're going to get the ones I'm sending you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll call this number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
