    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, brother. We have a problem here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's going on, sir? All right? Well? I ordered this—\n\nSpeaker 2: Subscription from y'all supposed to be called True Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I get—I get a package in the mail today, and it says generic Viagra, which y'all ain't supposed to be—\n\nSpeaker 2: Y'all charged me—\n\nSpeaker 1: $59.40 for the first 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I said I want to double it to make it up. Well, instead y'all took out another—\n\nSpeaker 1: $113 out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I still got 50 of these little white pills that are considered generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Three weeks to get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. I understand. I'm happy to help you. Just understand, I'm here to help you, so you don't need to yell.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Mitchell McElroy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and the zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 63701.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because my bank statement just said you got—you got—you got screwed here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm like, okay, so I got to looking at today when it came in. Yeah, y'all jank me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So sir, if we sent the wrong pill because we do carry both types, if there was a mistake, we will get this fixed, so—\n\nSpeaker 1: First, I just want to say, not that you're wrong about the charges—\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to say the one third, not when it came out of my account, and I got it here on my—\n\nSpeaker 1: Paperwork here, sir. If you're not going to allow me to speak, I cannot help you. You have to allow me to speak.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, please don't interrupt me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I was trying to tell you was the $113 was actually the initial charge; the $59 was the second charge. You had that—\n\nSpeaker 1: Back with. That's all I wanted to say. So the pills you have right now—\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, I know how the system works. There's no part in arguing this part. Can we let's move forward?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you tell me what's stamped on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang up. Yeah, yeah, I gotta find it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Need to know what's on the pill. That's why I asked about the pill, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, hang on. I gotta find the flashlight because this thing is so damn small. That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It—\n\nSpeaker 1: Is—\n\nSpeaker 2: Three three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you're not wrong. It was the wrong thing. The right pill would have said 50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to get you 50 of the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I will get this out right away.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the reason it took long was because of the laws in Missouri. It held things up.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's not going to happen this time around. It'll ship out right away this time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to get 50 of the correct pills. Those ones you have, if you want to throw them away, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we're going to send you out the right stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and it's not going to cost you anything because you've already paid. We're just fixing a mistake here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to get this taken care of with the pharmacy right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna have to wait three weeks before—\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, that was again because you weren't able to do the video portion. That's what took the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not going to happen again, so it'll ship out right, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All—\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. The only thing that's going to slow it down now is the snow that's going around.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everywhere in the country. That's the only thing that'll slow it down. Otherwise, the pharmacy will ship it right out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to even do priority mail for you on this one too to make sure it gets there a little faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, the lady said she's done priority on this one and still took 11 days to get here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And she knows who the four again, sir. It didn't take 11 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You keep forgetting that you didn't do the video, and that's what took forever.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't ship out until much later after you ordered it, but I'm going to get it shipped for you, so we're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I apologize then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sorry. I was just a little bit irritated when I saw that. I was like, what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, I totally understand. You're good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to get through it and make sure we can get this fixed rather than get stuck on—\n\nSpeaker 2: Small details, but you're—you're all good. I understand your frustration. You want to get what you're getting, so I have messaged the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: They will ship you out 50 of these right pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, and you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good one.",
