I'm calling in to let you know I need to cancel my order and account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me pull the prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Daniel Solis?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, I see that you have a prescription for Viagra 100 mg from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just don't need a refill or any health concern?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I need to cancel it because it's giving me high blood pressure and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: My doctor said I need to go ahead and get off that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. That was your first time taking Viagra, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I'm too old for that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we have patients older than you, sir. That's funny.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but that's okay. I don't want to chance it, so I'm going to get off.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, if it doesn't work, no, no, no, you should stop if it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: But did you take Cialis in the past? Maybe Cialis would be better help for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I need to cancel. I need to cancel, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to cancel all orders and close my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I did already. I was just trying to, you know, we try to help patients.\n\nSpeaker 1: We try to understand what's going on to document for research purposes.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: If anything changes, be aware of price change because we didn't pause, but we canceled everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, I was trying to kind of understand if you were more like a Cialis person than Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: because it's the two poles for people.\n\nSpeaker 1: Either or is going to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: If Viagra is not good for you, maybe Cialis will help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the two poles.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, yes, sir, I understand, but I'm going to go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I've been canceled already, like I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much, and you have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
