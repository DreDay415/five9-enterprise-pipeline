    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I had placed an order a little while back and I just received it today and it's not what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me help you out, Chester. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 12-22-1958.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you please tell me what's imprinted on the individual pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is an AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay, got it. Toss those in the trash can.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy made an error.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or the pharmacy probably ran out of AGVs to tell us and sent you generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second. I'm going to put in a replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so when you get this new bottle in the mail,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to say AGV on the bottle, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: And Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the Pfizer FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can just toss those generics in the trash can.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, they're already paid for, right, since I already paid?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I'm sending you exactly the same, just the correct medication for your charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, go ahead and keep them, but yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm not going to owe anything more, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. No, no, no. That was the pharmacy there. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know when they'll ship it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they'll ship it out to you tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they'll email you a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know, with the storm, because they're in Kentucky, maybe seven days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they'll email you a tracking number, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they'll ship it out first thing tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Does this happen very often?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, sometimes they run out because it's in such high demand.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it comes from Pfizer's manufacturer in France called Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we have it shipped from there to our pharmacy in Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: And sometimes they have so many orders, they send generics, and they don't tell us, which creates problems.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we get it fixed. So yeah, I apologize about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I can get the regular...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly. Like, why would you bother?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get that for a lot cheaper than this price, I can tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I understand your frustration.\n\nSpeaker 1: But no, I'm getting you out the correct stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll get it in a few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
