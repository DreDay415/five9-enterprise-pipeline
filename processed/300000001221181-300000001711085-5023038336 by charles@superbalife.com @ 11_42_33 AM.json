Smith?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you just want to have the doctor call you rather than having to deal with all the back and forth over the phone with messages and stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know, I had questions like, was it a reoccurring payment and all of that stuff, so I wouldn't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I mean, it does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't get me wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't necessarily need them every month, we don't hold anybody to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: We could do, like, every three months, four months, five months, whatever works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, but it'd still be kind of on a reoccurring type thing as far as charging to my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It comes with refills, so, I mean, we would need to keep the prescription alive by having at least one refill set for the year, so we can set it up for either June, July, whenever you need it, and then we're very customer-friendly, so you can call us and let us know whatever you need, and we'll accommodate however we need to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I've used other services before, and they were a lot easier than this, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: How?\n\nSpeaker 2: How?\n\nSpeaker 1: How?\n\nSpeaker 2: As far as just, you know, setting up online and, you know, say if I wanted to pause the subscription or ask any questions or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I've gotten probably 10 messages on my phone, keep saying, you know, I'm getting a message from the physician or something, and I go to it, and it's like nothing's, there's nothing new.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like the chat is stuck, and I don't know, it's just been different every time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, our customer service is a lot easier to deal with rather than going back and forth with the doctor, so just call us next time you have an issue, and we'll message the doctor for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can have him call you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason why the other people are a lot easier to deal with is because they're selling drugs from India and China, so it's a lot more dangerous, so yeah, they're going to want their stuff to get sent out immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: Our stuff is all FDA approved, so yeah, it's a little bit more trickier to get our stuff because our stuff is safer to take, so that's the main reason why it's a little bit more difficult.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, let the doctor call you by the end of the day today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Get everything sorted out and have the pills sent out to you immediately, and then pause everything for the next five months, that way you have time to try them, and then let us know what the future needs are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't know if I want to go through that because you guys are on the West Coast time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm in Louisville, Kentucky, so maybe when the doctor might call me, I might miss it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Our doctor, the doctor would be on central time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can have him call you within the time frame, it doesn't matter about time zones, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, what are my chances of cancelling everything?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything's going to be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you hear me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I can hear you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: See you soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
