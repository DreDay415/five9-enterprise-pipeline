    "text": "Speaker 1: Who is this speaking?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, how are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, my name is Steve Orms, A-R-M-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've spoken to, I believe his name was Joe a while back,\n\nSpeaker 2: and he sent me the directions to return an order that I am just really,\n\nSpeaker 1: really disappointed in because it wasn't what it was advertised to be.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we spoke for a while, and he sent me the link and everything,\n\nSpeaker 1: or the directions.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm getting ready to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And in the meantime, I had ordered the Viagra A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I initially ordered,\n\nSpeaker 1: but they sent me like 50 milligrams of just straight Sildenafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: Silendafil I think.\n\nSpeaker 1: So anyway, I ordered the Viagra A-G-V, and he and I spoke about it quite a bit,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, and I'm still rather skeptical.\n\nSpeaker 1: Eleven-minute work time and lasts for hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I received my order.\n\nSpeaker 1: My wife and I, we were excited about trying it, and it is just, I don't know,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's just a total bust.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're referring to the stuff that you just received that was delivered,\n\nSpeaker 2: that was sent out this month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, yeah, because it's the second time you received some 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, did you try that?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what you're saying, that you actually used?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife and I originally tried the first one just to see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that just wasn't even, that was nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get that through my primary care manager at the VA, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Joe and I talked for quite a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: He explained everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: We talked candidly about the Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: So went ahead and ordered it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It came in.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife and I were really excited.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, again, it's just not even close to what, you know, what it's advertised as.\n\nSpeaker 2: And why do you say that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why do you say it's not close to what it's advertised as?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, because it didn't work for quite some time,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it didn't last like it's been advertised, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Most of our customers do get that reaction.\n\nSpeaker 1: But just so you're aware, this is a body chemistry type of medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's about blood flow in your body.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what gives you an erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: So everybody is different.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's a lot of things that hinder your blood flow through your body, like, you know, stress.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could be overweightness.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could be nerve damage.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could be many things that hinder your blood flow, too much coffee, too much alcohol,\n\nSpeaker 1: too much food on your stomach can hinder the blood flow that's going to your penis.\n\nSpeaker 2: So although most men do see that time frame that we do, quote,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's where we got it from, from the clinical trials when we created this,\n\nSpeaker 2: is that not every man is going to see that reaction.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that is due to your own personal body and whatever may be going on that could be blocking it\n\nSpeaker 2: from having that long duration or that short activation time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because rest assured, the medication does have a new vasodynamic delivery system\n\nSpeaker 2: that does allow it to activate so fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if it's not doing that, it's generally a great indication that something else is going on\n\nSpeaker 2: that's blocking it from activating or blocking it from giving you the results that you're looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if you want to look into those things,\n\nSpeaker 2: but generally that is the case because the medication does work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, like I said, you know, my wife and I both, you know, we're pretty active.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're both in very good health, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: We spent 40 years in the military and I still carry my same physique, my same structure, my same everything,\n\nSpeaker 1: her the same way, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I know everybody's chemical makeup is different.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, we don't know what to do, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You might want to see a urologist, see an urologist, Mike,\n\nSpeaker 1: because it could be you might need something else or they can tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, obviously I'm not a doctor, sir, but I just do know that there are a lot of things that can hinder that, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I have a VA appointment on Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to bring this up, you know, to I'll go to urology and bring this up to them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can do that, but we will stop before you then, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: give you some time to figure things out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so tomorrow morning I'm going to send the first, you know, the first ones back for a full refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll wait until after I talk to my doctors and everything on Friday about what we're going to do with these other ones\n\nSpeaker 1: because, you know, I think we only took one, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't have to be in your bloodstream for a week or anything, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I'm following the direction.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't take more than two in a 24-hour period, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me ask you this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why can't you take more?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't see any results, why can't you take more than the one every 24 hours?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just the highest milligram dosage that doctors will approve.\n\nSpeaker 1: They say that it's not safe to take anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not exactly why it's not safe, but I believe it's just because it gets your heart pumping too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I've got guys that have called in and actually, you know, and they've said,\n\nSpeaker 2: oh, yeah, I've taken, you know, a little bit extra than I should have, and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm assuming they didn't die or anything because I talked to them, but, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: we do instruct them that, yeah, it's not really the safest thing to be doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: A doctor would not advise that, and I believe it's just due to the blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want it flowing too much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think anything over 100 might be too much, but that's the best that I would know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, she's going to be back today, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, she's in New Orleans right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm in another city, but she'll be coming back, and we're going to try, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: we'll try it one more time, but then if not, can I just use the same address and everything\n\nSpeaker 2: to send these back, you know, for my full refund?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's $63 or $68, you know, and if we're not seeing anything, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just soon get my money back, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand, and we will get it right back to you as soon as we,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, you ship that back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, like I said, those 50 mils, they're going back tomorrow morning,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll just wait and see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I said, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send those back to you in the morning and, you know, see what's going on with those\n\nSpeaker 1: and, you know, see the doctor, and like I said, we can continue down the line.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that sounds good, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Look, I really appreciate it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, wait, let me ask you this.\n\nSpeaker 1: The normal Viagra, that's why it's called the little blue pill because it's a blue pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: what color are this Viagra AGV supposed to be?\n\nSpeaker 1: What, which is what, I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, the regular Viagra that you can buy, it got its little blue name because it's a blue pill, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so the actual Viagra is a, yeah, it's a blue pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is a whole, it's a blue diamond shaped pill, which we also carry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Viagra AGV, what color is that pill supposed to be?\n\nSpeaker 2: White and diamond shaped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, white, okay, I just wanted to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no way.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's going to be white and diamond shaped and you'll only have the milligram dosage on the pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: which would be, if you're 50, you would have a 50, if it's 100, you would have a 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, well, I just wanted to make sure that I got the right thing in this bottle here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, man, well, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just, you know, I'll just try it again when my wife gets home.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, we're looking forward to it, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to make sure everything is up in front, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, well, we look forward to hearing back from you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, just call us back and we'll help you out the best we can.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, look, thank you very, very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome as well, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good luck.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
