    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, John. My name is Mike Starkey. I am trying to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have to give you a new card, but I had a quick question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right now, I'm getting 100-milligram tabs, and usually, I think in looking at my history,\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 come to an order, but it's the same price as 50, and there's 10 that come to the 50-milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: So my question to you is, are the 50-milligrams at a 20 count the same price as the 100-milligram for a 10 count?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. So the way we base our pricing is only on quantity. We do not change the price on the dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: So 10 of the 50 is the same as 10 of the 100, same as 25 of the 50 would be same as the 25 of the 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pricing is only based on quantity. When you buy more, the price per pill goes down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I usually get the 10 of the 100. If I got more, what would the price come down to per tab?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Are you in Rossford, Ohio, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the most recent one you got was $63.95 for 10. If we did 25 of those, it changes the price to $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think the math on that is like $4 a pill or something close to that as opposed to being $6 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's just do another 10 for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I got to give you a new card number because my card is expired, so I got to give you a new card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No problem. I can happily update that. Let's give you 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said it's expired? Because there's one in here that expires in 2030. Did the card change?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the last four of it?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0879?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So what happened was it got compromised, and so I had to get a new card. I'm sorry. I said expired.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, no. It's okay. It's fine. I just want to make sure because sometimes people, they update them online, and they're not sure it goes through.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to check if that was the case here. So I'm ready for the card when you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's a MasterCard, and the number is 5175-4671-8253-5426.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12 of 2030.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 368.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. We're all set. Your refill's been placed. This should ship out on Monday for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what is the address that's going to? 625 Lime Street, Lime City Road?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what I have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Roxburgh, Ohio. Okay. All right. Good. All right. All right. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Have a good weekend. Try and stay warm, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too, sir. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Yes, sir. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
