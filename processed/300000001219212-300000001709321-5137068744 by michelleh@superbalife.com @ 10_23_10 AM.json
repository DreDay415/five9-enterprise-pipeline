    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Rob Duncan. I have a prescription through there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And...\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just... Rob, can you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 3-30-70.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see the doctor put you on refills on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's what I was asking. Do you happen to have the medication on you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I do not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because it looks... I can confirm you just received just the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy did not send you the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: They probably ran out and they sent you generics and they didn't tell us and that creates a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me... Give me one second. I'm going to get you out of replacement\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. So they'll be shipping this out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get this new bottle in the mail, on the bottle it's going to say AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the FDA approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now on your bottle, when you get home, it's going to say APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pills, it has AC 390 or 340 imprinted on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can just go ahead and toss those in the trash can.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause it till July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your profile active with the doctor\n\nSpeaker 2: and allows the pharmacy to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll give you my extension so you can call me back\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get some water.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. 0020?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0020?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Perfect. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Is there any way that they can make that once every two months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me set that up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You can do it in any monthly intervals, like every one, two, three, four, five, up to six.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let's just make it once every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Three months. All right. Let me go back and fix that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's the price on that amount?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. So the price would still be the same, $63.95 for a quantity of ten.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they're going to ship that out to you today,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then your next refill is scheduled for April 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I won't have to pay for this one coming out?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. This one coming out, no. It's a replacement because they sent you the wrong medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And then if you don't need that one by April 27th, give us a call and you can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. No problem. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
