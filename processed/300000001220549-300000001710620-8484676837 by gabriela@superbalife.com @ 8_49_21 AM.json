I'm following up on an order I made on January 13.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What is your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Anthony Torres, 6-11-59.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Anthony.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the reason why the pharmacy hasn't shipped out your pills is because they do have a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you said that when it asked you about the medications that you're currently taking,\n\nSpeaker 2: it says that you listed a medication, Garcia, 10 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pharmacy wants to know what did you mean by that or what medication were you referring to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I answered that already. I said I don't have a medication by that name. It's in the chat.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, let me notify the pharmacy because it doesn't look like we received your response, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me notify them.\n\nSpeaker 1: How come it's in the chat?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. So then after that, we just have to wait for the pharmacy to ship it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we should be receiving it within the next three to five business days. Okay, Anthony?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I have to wait again. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Well, you're all set. Have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye. You're welcome. Bye.",
