    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello? Hi, I received an order of medicine from you today that I did not order. I ordered\n\nSpeaker 2: a set of pills from you earlier. I did not sign up for automatic refill. I'm not even\n\nSpeaker 1: sure you sent me what I ordered the first time. I was going to inquire about that when\n\nSpeaker 2: I called in for a refill, but you just shipped me another bottle today without me ordering\n\nSpeaker 1: it. Okay, what's your phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: 316-259-0109.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Eric Milgrin, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. Wichita, Kansas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you said that we originally didn't send you the correct one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you originally sent me a bottle of Cylindafil, but what I'd ordered was what I'd seen advertised,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm driving, I didn't have it written down, but the Cylindafil, it's got three additional\n\nSpeaker 2: letters on it that's kind of a new version.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, AGV, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If that's the case, Eric, we completely apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, mistakes happen, obviously\n\nSpeaker 2: they shouldn't, but if I can make it right, I do see that other charge and that other\n\nSpeaker 1: shipment. If you'd like, I can replace every single pill with the AGV. I can message my\n\nSpeaker 2: pharmacy right here, right now, and shoot you out the appropriate pills today and overnight\n\nSpeaker 1: them tomorrow so you get them ASAP. I guarantee you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't need them overnighted, but if you can send me the ones that I wanted, that'd be great. What\n\nSpeaker 1: do you want me to do with this bottle I just received today?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what? Are they still in the packaging, or do you still have the packaging it came in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I had to open the packaging.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had to open the packaging.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, they're still in the bottle. I opened the envelope to see what was in it, but I haven't opened the pill bottle. Is that\n\nSpeaker 2: envelope salvageable?\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Probably not, okay. It'll probably cost a couple bucks\n\nSpeaker 1: to send it back, but nothing crazy, but the Southgate, Kentucky address that's on the\n\nSpeaker 2: pill bottle, send it back to them. As soon as they have it back, they'll issue the refund,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and in the meantime, you're going to send me the AGV. Is that for my last\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription, and then when I call in for renewal, I'll order for the AGV as well?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes. I'll make sure that this doesn't happen again, and then we'll be sending you the appropriate\n\nSpeaker 1: things from here on out.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and I'll send this one back to the folks in Kentucky\n\nSpeaker 1: or wherever they are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sounds good, brother. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
