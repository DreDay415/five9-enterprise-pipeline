    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking, who do I have the pleasure of speaking\n\nSpeaker 2: with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Mario Munoz.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Mario, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing well, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good, thank you so much for asking, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I got an order of the pills today, but I didn't order them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I can look into that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the phone number that's going to be associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: 731-313-9149.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said 731-313-9149.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we don't have anything under that number.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the email that's going to be associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: 196711 at iCloud.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you spell the first word?\n\nSpeaker 1: Malco. M-A-L-C-O.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 9167. There you are. There you are, Mario. What's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 8-15-1967.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, and you're located at 476 Shadow Ridge Drive, Jackson, Tennessee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I do see your prescription here. Yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills with\n\nSpeaker 2: your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when\n\nSpeaker 2: the prescription would expire. If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is,\n\nSpeaker 1: you would still be able to order within that period of time. You just have to give us a\n\nSpeaker 2: call to place the order yourself if you did want to order anything before that date.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'd just go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the pills, they didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Okay, the last part of my job is to let you know that\n\nSpeaker 1: if the pills didn't work for you, you do qualify for a free sample of our newest,\n\nSpeaker 2: highest quality product, because it looks like you haven't tried it, and it is a superior\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription to your current one. And the way that would work is, the free sample is 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it would probably get to you by next Tuesday or Wednesday, and you'd have until June to try\n\nSpeaker 1: them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script, so almost like a\n\nSpeaker 2: five-month free trial. But the way you want to think about it is, it would be a new prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: that is started by the free sample, but placed on hold for you until June while you try it out,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you love it, make sure you prefer it to your old script. We believe you would, based off\n\nSpeaker 1: of the reviews. The reviews are really good, and that you'd give us a call within that window of\n\nSpeaker 2: time to order some. And if not, you just have 10 pills, and you'd need to let us know by June,\n\nSpeaker 1: either way. But they are the fastest-acting, longest-lasting pill we've ever sold.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about them is, we've specifically formulated them\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And these are absolutely completely free?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me try them out then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So I'll send these to you at 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's what you've already been approved for. And can I ship this free sample to 476\n\nSpeaker 1: Shadow Ridge Drive, Jackson, Tennessee, 38305?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So yeah, you should receive\n\nSpeaker 2: these probably by next Tuesday or Wednesday, pending. I know there's like a storm or something,\n\nSpeaker 1: but fingers crossed it'll all be fine. And then if you need anything before June,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're always here. Just give us a call at December Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm not going to get no further shipping after this free sample, right? It's on hold right\n\nSpeaker 2: now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, other than the 10 free pills, I shouldn't get no more until June, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty. Well, thanks so much, Mario. Yeah, I hope you...\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, bye.",
