    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Jeff Hugel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Jeff, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, how can I help you today Jeff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just want to call in and cancel my subscription, my recurring whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Jeff, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-11-54.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 27 Davis Road, Happy Camp, California, 96039?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that was just a temporary address for the summer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so I do see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just want to cancel that because, I mean, I'm 71 years old, I'm not that active sexually,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I still got pills from the last time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, just so you know, Jeff, you certainly do not have to receive those regular refills\n\nSpeaker 1: with your prescription if you don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option, especially because you have a larger order,\n\nSpeaker 1: to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription expires if we don't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to place it on hold,\n\nSpeaker 2: you could still order within the next six months or at some point before July 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then what happens after six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it go back to automatic renewal?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the whole prescription and its refills would be placed on hold for six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: so then July 27th you would be set up for one refill per year unless you called us a little bit earlier\n\nSpeaker 2: to say, hey, I'm out of pills, can you send me some?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or, hey, I still have, like, 20 pills left, can you leave me on hold another, like, four months\n\nSpeaker 2: or whatever you need and then we can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, you just need to let us know by the end of July either way.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, the script would be set up since it seems like you don't need the pills that regularly\n\nSpeaker 1: to one every six months, so essentially one a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I think I'll just go ahead and cancel it altogether.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do only pay for the doctor's visit the one time because we allow the prescription to be placed on hold,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it is my job to let you know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it is also my job to let you know that I don't think this is the case,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if the pills weren't working for you, you do technically qualify for a current promotional offer we're doing,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is we are sending out a free sample of 10 pills of our newest, highest quality stuff to folks who haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is our fastest-acting, longest-lasting pill we've ever made,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's our newest stuff from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you did want to try it, it comes with a six-month free trial where I would send them to you\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'd have until July to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe that you would, based off of the reviews and the data,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that you'd give us a call back at some point before then to order some, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not, you just have 10 free pills, and if they didn't work, you just need to let us know by July,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I think you'd know a lot sooner than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we're always here, Monday through Friday at least.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because really, truthfully, for me, the pills don't – I've taken Viagra before,\n\nSpeaker 2: and these just don't seem to do – you know, they don't react to me as well, and I still get the headaches.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's another thing I can't stand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: This other one, is this also a Viagra type of –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it's improved or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I would be willing to try that six-month trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I'm going to send you 10 pills, and like I mentioned, it's completely free.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send them to you at 50 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship these to 27 Davis Road?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I've got a new address here in Arizona.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so what's that address?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is 80 West Main Street, Box 1841, and that's in Quartzsite, Q-U-A-R-T-Z-S-I-T-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's Quartzsite, Arizona, 85346.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said 85356?\n\nSpeaker 1: 85346, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: 46, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 80 West Main Street, and you said Box 1841, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quartzsite, is that Q-U-A-R-T-Z-S-I-T-E?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Quartzsite, Arizona, 85346.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, so let me update that to 80 West Main Street, Box 1841, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'll make sure shipping, update that and make sure that we get it to the right place.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so the free sample we're shipping to 80 West Main Street, Box 1841, Quartzsite, Arizona, 85346.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, so these should be out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually I'd say by Friday, but with this winter storm, maybe it'll be Monday, Tuesday at the latest.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, if you need anything before July, we're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then last but not least, just an important reminder, you want to make sure, Jeff, to take these on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you also want to make sure that you avoid caffeine and alcohol the day you take them, just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Jeff, well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I hope you have a great day, and I hope you love these, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
