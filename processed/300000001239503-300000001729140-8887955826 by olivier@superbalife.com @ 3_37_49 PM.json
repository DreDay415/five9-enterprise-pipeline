May I have the phone number that you used for your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is 763-291-9594.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Clark. I was able to pull your prescription of 10 tablets, 50 mg. Any health concerns or you just write the order as needed instead of go on the monthly they got you in here?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay. So I'm going to tell the pharmacy to stop the initial writing from the doctor for every 30 days because obviously you're not required to get it as often. That's just initial writing and they're going to pause the prescription. I think they'll pause it up to half a year so you don't go to get in on a monthly which allow you to reorder at the same price, but you just cut off the monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And if you get to refill a year, they're always going to keep you at the same price. That's just the minimum.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you can do that, you'll be set at the same price, but I'm just going to cut the monthly for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay? Okay. All right. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Clark. I was able to pause the prescription and stop the monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And like I say, get your refill twice a year and you will always get the price that you currently have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sounds good. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thanks. Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.",
