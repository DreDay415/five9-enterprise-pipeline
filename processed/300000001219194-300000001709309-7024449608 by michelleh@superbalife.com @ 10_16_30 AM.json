    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. I did not receive all my order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me help you out. Can you just confirm your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Bukam Kampuwong, July 6, 1974.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Bukam. I see you're a VIP status member.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you bought a quantity of 10, and then you added an additional 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's going to be a quantity of 20 in that one bottle you received.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 10 and 10, is it AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the pills in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I have it in front of me, but it's still didn't fill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you take one pill out and tell me what's imprinted on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. No worries. Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Looks like it said AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. That's what I wanted to know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Those are just generics then, the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. They screwed up. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to get you out a replacement of the correct medication,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Perfect. So I put in an order. They'll be shipping out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I apologize. Sometimes they run out of the AGV, and they don't tell us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that creates problems. So I put in the correct order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this new bottle in the mail in a few days, on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to say AGV, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: the only number imprinted is going to be the number 50 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it will say Greenstone on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it will only have the number 50 imprinted on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because, yeah, yours say AC. Those are just generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: So go ahead and throw those out, and I'm sending you a total of 25 instead of 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the color will be different? Is it going to be blue?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. It's going to be white. The pill is going to be white.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it used to say AGV on it in blue, but they took out the blue ink\n\nSpeaker 2: because it's just an additive that your body doesn't need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So it's just going to be the 50 print on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, just the number 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: That will be the only thing imprinted on those pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it's going to be 25 pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I'm sending you 25 instead of 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the bottle, it will say Greenstone, LLC.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now I think your bottle says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that's what that is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can just throw those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So it's going to be Greenstone?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, on the bottle, and then only the number 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it won't say AGV on it, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it will not. No. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It's going to be 25 pill, Greenstone, and 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Is there going to be additional charge or fee?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you got the incorrect medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's free charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. So the pill I have is useless, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's basically just regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just go ahead and throw those away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quick question.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you ship it out today, how long would it take, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: You should get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pharmacy will email you a tracking number once they ship it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe a little bit longer because of storms.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Seven days or less, you'll have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
