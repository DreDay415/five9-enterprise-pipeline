    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Hello. I was just calling to get a refill on my prescription there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Not a problem. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Robert, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. 3-18-48.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you so much. I see your profile.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to do another – actually, we have way better deals right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're paying $263.95 for a quantity of 50 – just the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You haven't tried the new AGV, which is Pfizer's latest formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: It works better. It just kicks in quicker. It's just better.\n\nSpeaker 1: And right now you can get a quantity of 40 for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'd be saving $100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And if I stayed with the other form, I could get 50 for about the same price?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. You're paying $263.95 for a quantity of 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then the price you quoted me was what again?\n\nSpeaker 2: $163.95 for a quantity of 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Go ahead and do that if you would, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. Not saving $100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are we still using your Visa ending in 7-1-0-9?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me check. I don't think so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got another – no, I've had fraud on that account. I've got another Visa here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'm ready for the number when you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Numbers 4147, 1802, 6987, 3028.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-29.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three digits on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: 274.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Perfect. That went through. They'll be shipping it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That sounds fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just send them to me like just so I can avoid the phone call and reordering and stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you send them another prescription like in 60 days or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So a quantity of 40 actually sends you refills every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your next one would go out April 28th of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I wanted, I could get a refill prior to that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. If you need a refill before that, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Perfect. You're up.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're done, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. We're done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, thanks for your help now.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
