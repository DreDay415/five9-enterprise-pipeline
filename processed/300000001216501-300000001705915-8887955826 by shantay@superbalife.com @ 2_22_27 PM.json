    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Scott Lauer and I'm calling to make sure that my prescription was canceled but I just got another batch of meds in the mail and I talked to the gentleman at the beginning of this week or the end of last week who was supposed to cancel this. I'm just making sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: He was going to send me a sample. I want to make sure this is a sample. I'm not being charged for these.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sure, I can take a look into this for you. Can I have your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, 17315 and I also have the RX number here if you'd like to have that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, no, I actually was able to pull up your account with your name and zip code so...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I see that one of my colleagues did send you a sample of the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you did receive, that's the AGV and you weren't charged for it. It's a free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then if these do work for me I can call back and then I can start getting these in replacement, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, very good. That's all I need to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Well, you're all set and you enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, bye-bye.",
