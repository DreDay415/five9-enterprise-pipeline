    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, yes. My name is Bill Andrew, and I am a customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I have ordered the new SCORE Blue Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the first shipment that was sent to me was just generic Viagra, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I called, and you guys made it right and sent me a second shipment that was supposed to be the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I don't think it is, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you can check, because on the label, the label is the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if it's supposed to be the AGV, why does it say take one to two tablets by mouth one hour before sex as needed when it's supposed to work in 11 minutes?\n\nSpeaker 1: My concern is, and the pictures are on your website right now, and the pictures show the tablet with AGV on it, and this doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: This just has a number 50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that does sound correct. If it has a number 50, it should be a 50 on one side and blank on the other.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can't like technically put that little blue coating on because that's when you get into like terms of branding and licensing and trademark disputes and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as far as the hour before, kind of a similar thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just so the manufacturer is protected.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you take that pill and it kicks in in 30 minutes, that's so you don't try to bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you definitely should still see results, I would say.\n\nSpeaker 2: And a lot of guys are seeing them in as little as 25 minutes, I would say, anywhere from 10 to 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Little as 11, though, for your fastest bioavailability gentleman out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the label should just be different than the first one, only in the sense that it will indicate that it has the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see the AGV indication on the label on the new pill and not on the old one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the old one, the markings will say like they'll have a combination of numbers and letters.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like an AC and then three followed by two other letters.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the new pill, it'll just say 50 on one side and be blank on the other.\n\nSpeaker 1: So not so much the name, but the manufacturer that it comes from is the most important thing there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I understand that. I just want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: A lot of people do, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And that's great. I'm great with that. I just wanted to double check and make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, of course. Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, it should be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it should be good. Let us know how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, I sure will. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
