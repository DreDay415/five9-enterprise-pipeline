    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: First name is Dan. Last name is Ferber. F-E-R-B-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And Mr. Ferber, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6 3 3 8 3.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty then. Take a look. I have you at 24265 Lost Creek Ranch in Warrington, Missouri.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and you're looking to cancel your refills. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I've been looking to cancel it for like the last three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, that's a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I keep getting them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Well, I'm sorry about that. Let me go ahead and turn that off for you. Let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is only every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can turn that off for you so you can just get it at will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to do that instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just order whenever you feel like it?\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be better. Yeah, so far, I really don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on testosterone and everything works fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, let me go ahead and do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: This will keep your prescription active and you can access the refills when you feel like it,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't get any random stuff in the mail. But full disclosure,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you do not order anything in a six-month period,\n\nSpeaker 2: you will get one 10-pill refill instead of the full 25 unless you want a full 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want any.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, if I cancel the prescription, unfortunately, and just full disclosure again,\n\nSpeaker 2: it cancels the prescription altogether, and we can't, you know, place any new orders, which is why...\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got like 75 of these things now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem. All right. Well,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're all set. I've canceled it. Again, you can't order down the line, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.",
