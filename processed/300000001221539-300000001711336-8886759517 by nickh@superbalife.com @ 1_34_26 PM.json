I can help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you please provide the full name and date of birth under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. It's Richard Brodala.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's B-R-O-D-A-L-A.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6-9-1941.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you need this prescription, you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: I should be able to find your account with just this information.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Richard, I'm looking at your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like that prescription was initially written back in November of 2025.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that was for the 50 mg Viagra AGV, a quantity of 10 each fulfillment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it looks like the doctor here wrote it with refills monthly due to the low mg dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, Richard, I'm not sure if you saw in the notes from the initial prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you're not required to get these every month or obligated.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is not a subscription. This is a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is perfectly adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted to have access to the remaining nine refills, you could simply pause it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you can cancel it altogether.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So upon cancellation, the prescription would be officially closed,\n\nSpeaker 1: and any future prescriptions are required to go through a new doctor consultation,\n\nSpeaker 2: health survey, and pending approval.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and took care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
