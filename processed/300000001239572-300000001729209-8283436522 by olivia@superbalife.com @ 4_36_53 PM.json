What's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: January the 14th, 1968.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 911 Canterbury Court, Gastonia, New York?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's North Carolina. Where in the world did y'all get New York from?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope y'all haven't sent it off yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Jonathan, we're going to have to step the attitude back a little bit if we want some\n\nSpeaker 2: help. Do you want some help from me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, wait a minute. First of all, I didn't get belligerent or nasty.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I know when I filled out my information, I put NC on there, not NY.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have an attitude.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when I spend my money, I expect the place that I got it from to have the\n\nSpeaker 1: right address on there because that wasn't my mistake of mine.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was a mistake of y'all's.\n\nSpeaker 1: So don't sit here and say, I got an attitude.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can go head on with that because I spent my money with your company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, you still have an attitude.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me when my package is going to be sent off?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all you need to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unfortunately, I actually can't tell you exactly,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's probably going to take a little while.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't tell you exactly, but it's probably going to go out tomorrow morning,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I speak to somebody else?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, yeah, call us right back and you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
