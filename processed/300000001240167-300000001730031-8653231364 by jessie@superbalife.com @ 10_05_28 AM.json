    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Michael Hayes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Mr. Hayes, what is your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 27344.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. Are you at 615 Poe Road? Is it Siller City or Siler City?\n\nSpeaker 2: Siler City. I've heard that a whole lot. It's Siler. Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Siler City. Okay. Perfect. And then let's see here. Did you have a question about billing or do you want to turn off the monthly?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, man. They just took $63 out of my account and threw me in the red. I didn't know nothing about that monthly stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me turn that off for you so that way you don't get charged every month. Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pharmacy hasn't even shipped it yet. Can you sort of stop that?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the pharmacy hasn't shipped it. Let me see if they can still pull it, but here it shows that it's already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, we're not going to go through no problems here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I want to cancel it all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me go ahead and turn that off for you so that way you don't get charged anything else. Do you prefer that it's just on demand so you can just order when you feel like it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, because I've got enough. It don't happen quite often, but yeah, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You're good as in you're fine with the supply or you're good as in you'd like me to just do it on demand?\n\nSpeaker 1: On demand, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let's do that. That way you won't get anything random in the mail anymore. You can place an order whenever you feel like it. Just make sure that when you do order, give us a call so we can always ensure that your account is maintained on demand. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, of course. It's always good to know what you're getting. Just a quick full disclosure. If you do not order anything after six months, you do get one refill. You're sent one refill, and that keeps your prescription active. Otherwise, there's nothing else that you get. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, honey, you have a blessed day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your help so kindly. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Thank you. Have a good day, sir. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you as well, ma'am.",
