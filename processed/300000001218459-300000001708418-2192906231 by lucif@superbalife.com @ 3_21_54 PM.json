Am I speaking to Mr. King?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Mr. King, how can I help you out today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, today I was calling to make sure my prescription was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wow. What's going on? Is it not working for you, or what's happening?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's nothing like that. I just can't afford it right now, so I wanted to halt all the...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's fine. You can order this when you want, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can just stop everything, and you can order your next order in the next five months, whenever you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'll be no problem. I would just like to cancel it right now, and if I need to, I can call back and order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so basically what we do is for the next five months, we'll just keep your prescription open and allow you to call for your refills on your own in that time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'll just go ahead and cancel it altogether, because I might forget, and then if I need it again...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but if you need it again, you won't have a prescription. That's why I'm trying to tell you we can keep it available.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so is this five months, if I don't call back, then it'll start again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you can get whatever you would want in five months. If you want to continue the same way that you are now, we can keep it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want it anymore, we can get rid of it. It's totally up to you, sir, on how you proceed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's okay. I'll just go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, just know you will not be able to reorder with us once your prescription is gone, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.",
