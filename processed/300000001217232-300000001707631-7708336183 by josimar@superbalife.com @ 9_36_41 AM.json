I ordered a refill this morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh yeah, you received that through the e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got that confirmation. My name is Todd Hache, H-A-C-H.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Of course, can you repeat that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, Todd Hache, it spells out that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello? Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so I pulled you up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Since you ordered this today, it's going to take 24 to 48 hours to receive that through the e-mail, say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last time I got an e-mail confirmation, that's all it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: This time it's a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it could take as long as 24 hours, though, but you'll receive it through the e-mail inbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, buddy. All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Bye-bye.",
