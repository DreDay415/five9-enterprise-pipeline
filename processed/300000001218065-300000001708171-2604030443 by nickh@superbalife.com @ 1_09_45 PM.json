Not a problem, Don.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll expect those, and once those are received, we'll get you that refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wish they worked, and they probably worked for somebody.\n\nSpeaker 2: They don't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: So thanks for your understanding.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, of course. Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
