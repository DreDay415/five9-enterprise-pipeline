    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Hi, Joanna. I'd like to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sure. We can happily assist you with that. Let me just pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you please verify your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: David Barner, and the DOB is May 11, 1948.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. I do have your account pulled up here, and I see that you are a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how did you like the results from the 100 milligram Viagra that you had been taking?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've used it in the past. Your price is just way out of whack.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to cancel it online a couple of weeks ago, almost a month ago, and they said I have to call, and I forgot about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when I originally got it, I thought I was getting the – I can't remember the three letters, but the new and improved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh. Do you happen to have it with you? Could you read to me what it says on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: On my tablet?\n\nSpeaker 2: On the –\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just – it's just the 100 milligram tablet generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead and pull one of them out and read to me what it says on the actual pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to see if you got the HEP or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says AC-350.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you for confirming that. It looks like the pharmacy sent you the generic FDA-approved Viagra and not the new HEV.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to send you a replacement order of the HEV Viagra, and how you're going to know it's the HEV, it will say 100 on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to notice a significant difference in how well it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for the time being, I'm going to remove the monthly reoccurring refills because you're not – we're not a subscription, so you're not obligated to get refills every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you decide to continue being our customer, we're incredibly flexible in terms of how you want to set up your account, and you can always put a pause on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for right now, I'll put a three-month pause on it and send you a replacement order at no cost of the AGV Viagra for you to try out, and then you can determine how you want to set up your account going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Tell me, is there a cost difference?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, there isn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: So 10 would be $63.95, which is what you paid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Obviously, the higher the quantity that you get at a time, the better price per go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, it's the AGV because we just launched it, and it's in high demand.\n\nSpeaker 2: We haven't raised the prices yet, but that is the price for them at this time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, hey, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I look forward to trying that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for calling in, and I'm glad I was able to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
