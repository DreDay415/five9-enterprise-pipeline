    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, my name is Clayton Jones and I got another order of your—\n\nSpeaker 2: It came out of my account for 63.95 or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I called you guys back in, I think it was, let me look here, back in August on the 4th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And canceled the, and I hadn't got any more—\n\nSpeaker 1: But then on the 10th of February, I got another charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was like, what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: I called the bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So—\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm looking at your prescription right here and I'll just kind of give you a review of what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: First off, just to let you know, you've already been issued a refund due to the dispute alert.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So your, your bank marked this as fraudulent.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you were automatically issued that refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The prescription as a whole, back in August, you called in and they sent you replacements—\n\nSpeaker 2: Of the Viagra AGV, or they sent you a trial, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: For you to try it and then come back and see if you liked it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: In order to keep your prescription active, your prescription was put on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: That prescription pause expired and that's why that recent order went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Because we did not hear from you to adjust it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, like I said, your account has been frozen and canceled because you did the dispute alert.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you have nothing more to worry about, but that's just an explanation—\n\nSpeaker 2: Of the timeline of what happened here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Because I didn't even realize that there was a charge; I thought you guys was giving back—\n\nSpeaker 2: On the, in, in August, because I actually was told to send the medication back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I think the customer service guy said, well, try the new one that we have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, that's AGV, a little stronger and, um, hey, granted it did, you know—\n\nSpeaker 1: Much better than the original, but, um, I, I never, you know, subscribed to get the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just went through in order to keep the prescription active. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, cause it, it's just so the doctor, you know, cause otherwise it expires—\n\nSpeaker 2: And you would lose access to the medication. So that's why it went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: But as I said, you, you, you did the dispute with the bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, unfortunately I couldn't even accept an order from you now if I tried, uh—\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the account is deactivated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And with that being said, now, um, cause I have another bank—\n\nSpeaker 1: Bank account, but at any rate, um, the AGV seemed to be better than, um, first—\n\nSpeaker 2: But I thought you sent me for the 63.95 or so when I first got the eight, when I—\n\nSpeaker 1: First got the order from you guys and it was in the AGV, I thought it was more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's, it's, it's more expensive.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, 30 pills for the a hundred milligram generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he sent me $63 worth of AGV, uh, that just happened to be 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, he did that as a replacement. Uh, and then, like I said, that refill went—\n\nSpeaker 1: Through. Um, yeah, so yeah, that is the price for 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if you jump up to 40 in the future, it's 149 and you save a dollar 50 per—\n\nSpeaker 1: Pill. But as I said, Mr. Jones, this account is frozen and canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't even place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. So if I, if I were to call and, and, um, do a new order of the AGV, I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Could just go to my, um, maybe federal account, a different account. Can I do—\n\nSpeaker 1: It that way? Oh, okay. What would I, what would I need to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Unfortunately, you're unable to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh my God. Okay. Oh my God.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I would have, uh, I would have recommended, give us a call and then we—\n\nSpeaker 1: Could just call the charge today rather than speed alert online on the bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, but because our system marks this, uh, your name and address as a kind of—\n\nSpeaker 1: Market flags it. And so any order is going to clean Jones at five 90 grand—\n\nSpeaker 2: View, Georgia. Uh, it will not accept. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, and you know, I started to wait and because I called you guys the first—\n\nSpeaker 2: Time I started to wait and say, let me talk to him. Cause what's my service—\n\nSpeaker 1: Was so good the first time. So that's my mistake there. Wow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. No, no. You know, I've, I've, yeah. So I, I'm really sorry. I wish I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Could. Okay. Then. All right. Well, thanks a lot. I just, you know—\n\nSpeaker 2: Got to, I got to figure out a way here. Hi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.",
