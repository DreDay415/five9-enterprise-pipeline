My phone is going nuts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me help you out, sir. If I can get your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Carl, G-I-A-I-M-O. Zip code's 53-0-9-5.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: County Highway Z in West Bend.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Good news is those texts are that you've been approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you got approved for the medication that you put in for today.\n\nSpeaker 2: We will ship this out within one to two business days. So you are going to get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So you're just waiting now for it to actually ship out of the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: It has the process there and then they'll mail it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will get an email sent to you when it ships with a postal service tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is the Viagra A-G-V or whatever?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I see you ordered. 50 milligrams, 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. That's what I see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now I just got to wait for it to get here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, sir. You should have it sometime between Wednesday and Friday of next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometime around that time of week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. No problem. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to make sure the order went through because, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 2: my phone started going goofy with a bunch of texts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, those texts are just saying that you're good to go and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, one last thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will be delivered directly to your mailbox too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes people think it goes to the front door.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just look for it in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Yep. That would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all I needed to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: One other question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is this Sidenafil or Sidenafil?\n\nSpeaker 2: Every Viagra has Sidenafil in it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the other inactive ingredients that are different,\n\nSpeaker 2: but even the name brand Viagra is Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what actually gets you the erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because I have that from my doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: My urologist gave me a prescription of, like, 20 pills or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think it's the name of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Every version of Viagra, even the name brand is Sidenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just the medical name for that drug.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the difference is the EGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the inactive ingredients are better\n\nSpeaker 1: because it better gets the medicine into your bloodstream.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it works more effectively every time.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will work faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I have to talk to my doctor about this?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we had a doctor prescribe it to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that's what that text was about, that our doctor said you're all good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty then, I'll wait for her to get here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
