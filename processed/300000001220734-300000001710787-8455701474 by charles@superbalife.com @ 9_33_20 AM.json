That's fine, bro.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: With the activator pill, David, do me a favor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Be consistent with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take it like an antibiotic, if you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do it like every day in the morning, and it should flush out your system\n\nSpeaker 1: and increase the blood flow down to the genital area, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I'm in good shape, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: I walk six, seven days a week.\n\nSpeaker 1: I play pickleball, and I lift weights four days a week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Love that. Okay, so maybe we just need to pivot a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll figure it out together.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you all this free product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully this turns the table for us, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, listen, if I got to pay for shipping,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you want to send it first day, I'll pay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll take care of that as well, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to worry, but like I said, the weather right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: very unpredictable.\n\nSpeaker 1: Our staff here is telling me it's very unpredictable.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll just wait till it comes.\n\nSpeaker 1: When is my next shipment?\n\nSpeaker 2: When is my next shipment due?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was February, February 4th, so I'll push that now.\n\nSpeaker 2: With these ones on their way, I'll push it to March 16th, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, perfect. Thank you, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good. All right, David.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're the best. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it. Take care.",
