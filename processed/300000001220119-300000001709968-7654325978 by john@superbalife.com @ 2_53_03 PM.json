    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, John. Okay, I called up before. I had an order that came yesterday before I went to work, and it was the wrong pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, this is a new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was just wondering if, um, I called, they took care of it, and I don't know what they're shipping. Are they going to still charge me for shipping?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, we don't charge you for the shipping, and I can tell you if it's shipped. I just need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, Kaczynski, Paul, K-O-Z-I-N-S-K-A-Y-3-2-1-5. No, I already paid, but they sent me the wrong pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, I know what you're talking about. We've had a couple, this has popped up a couple times, so we have a procedure.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're not charging you at all. I can tell you that without even seeing your profile. I'm just going to see if it's already shipped for you. One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're in Milwaukee?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: How cold is it there? My friend's going there in a few days, and I'm wondering what he's in for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the air is cold. It was really cold. Right now, it's only around 10, but it was colder before.\n\nSpeaker 2: I saw it was like negative 8 or something the other day. I was like, geez.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the wind chill, it was around 30-something, but now it's like around 5, minus 5.\n\nSpeaker 2: Braver than...\n\nSpeaker 1: But the air is cold. Yeah, I wouldn't visit.\n\nSpeaker 2: He got roped into something with his girlfriend. Okay, Paul, so your order, the agent that helped you did do exactly what he said,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it actually did ship out today, or they created a label, so it's probably with the post office, so you should see it in a few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, but would I be charged for shipping, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, you're not charged anything at all. We just ship for free to make sure you get the right thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no, I was just going to say, because I just have my rent from last month still in the check-in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I totally understand. No, no, no, we didn't charge you for shipping or anything at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, thanks a lot. I just wanted to know. All right, thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Bye-bye.",
