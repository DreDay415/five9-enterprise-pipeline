    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Greg Payne.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Greg. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. How can I help you today, Greg?\n\nSpeaker 2: I had ordered some of the Viagra AGV a while back, and then the first one they sent me was just a generic Viagra, and it wasn't AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then they sent another order that was a generic Viagra AGV, but there was only 10 of them in it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The original one had 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, anyways, I've tried them, and it doesn't do anything for me, different than what my Tadalafil does, that I get through my insurance at no cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just needed feedback, getting a refund on what I need to send them back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely do that. So the email we have on file for you, it's gregpayneconstruction at gmail.com. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It has a dot between it, greg and Payne, greg.payne.construction at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Give me one moment, because I'm going to update that, because for some reason on your profile it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. greg.payneconstruction at gmail.com. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a dot after greg and then another one after Payne. So greg.payne.construction at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: greg.payne.construction. greg.payne.construction. This is so weird that it is not saving for me to update it. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, even when you're trying to do it manually, it's still not letting you do it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. That's okay. Okay. That's fine. I can just type it in then. Weird. Okay. So yeah, I will send you an email with the instructions for how to return it to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Oh, perfect, greg.payne. Perfect. Okay. And then as long as we receive it, you have 90 days. Yeah, we can just, the minute we receive it back, we will process your refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you so much, greg.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry they didn't work out for you. Yeah, I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. You too. Thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
