If you have any, you know, like side effects, if they're\n\nSpeaker 1: too strong, call me, bud, I'll be your guy to do lateral moves, I can always do replacements,\n\nSpeaker 2: but make sure you call me within 30 days. I can say, oh, these are not working anymore,\n\nSpeaker 1: like they're too strong or whatever, like, because some guys pop, you can pop two within\n\nSpeaker 2: a 24-hour period and you can go longer, right? That's why the 50s are very popular.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so when you go on Billy, when you go on scoreblue.com, use your Gmail to log in, right? So when you\n\nSpeaker 2: log in, you're going to see what I did. You go under a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did a couple of things there. I adjusted the quantity to 10 and I put a red button\n\nSpeaker 2: that says quick refill. Now you can call me or click that button anytime you want\n\nSpeaker 1: to get a refill. Just know in the state of Florida, we can't refill more than one time\n\nSpeaker 2: in a 30-day period and you just have to maintain 20 pills a year or every six months or something\n\nSpeaker 1: like that, but just call me and then we'll take good care of you, alright bud, call me\n\nSpeaker 2: bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, I sure appreciate it, you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey you bubba, that's all we roll and I don't want to end up with some alligators on my\n\nSpeaker 1: toes, you know I won't last a damn thing, that's all, I'll make sure I take care of\n\nSpeaker 2: you Mr. Bird, alright Billy, take care man, enjoy, alright, adios, buh-bye.",
