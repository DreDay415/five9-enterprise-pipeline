I put a stop to any and all monthly\n\nSpeaker 1: shipments. I put a stop to any and all monthly refills. And I certainly put a\n\nSpeaker 2: stop to any and all monthly charges. And I paused your prescription and I set up a\n\nSpeaker 1: red button. So when you go to scoreblue.com, right, and you log in with\n\nSpeaker 2: your Verizon email, find a category that says your prescription, right. And then\n\nSpeaker 1: on that category you'll see a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can click that button anytime you want, okay. The only caveat to that\n\nSpeaker 1: is in your state you can't do more than one refill in the 30-day period for the\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV. And no less than 20 pills a year sometime next year. So as long as you do\n\nSpeaker 1: that we're good to go. Alright bud? Or just call me when you need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright bud. You take care bud. Have a good one. God bless you bud. Bye bye.",
