    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking, who do I have with me today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Dale Arden.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Dale, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, I need to cancel my order, they do not work, I've had them and had them and they're just not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that Dale.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so Dale, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 8-20-67.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, and you're located at 2811 West Lacewood Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, yeah, so, yeah, I can see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, well just so you know Dale, if you don't want to receive those regular prescription refills, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then you could, you would still have access to the scripts, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we can stop it right now then, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, and then the prescription is on hold, so if you need anything before the end of July, you can have it, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now what ones are those, because I thought I was getting, when I ordered, I thought I was getting, what were they called, and that's why I was wondering if they were the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I thought I was getting the Fagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so no, but if you want to try some out, I'd be happy to send you out a sample, a free sample of 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because that's what I thought they were, and I got looking at them, yeah, I got looking at them, it just says the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, generic don't work for me, you know, Viagra quit working for me, and I thought, well, and then I got thinking, me and my wife, we thought it was the AGV Viagra, because it's supposed to be 11 minutes, supposed to be stronger, healthier, and last for 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it is definitely a superior prescription, it's the fastest acting, longest lasting stuff, but then my favorite thing about it is that we specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I'd be thrilled to send you a free sample of some, so I can send you 10 pills, I'm going to send them at 50 milligrams, because that's what you've already been approved for, and then can I ship them to 2811 West Lacewood Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84129?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that'd be perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So, great, these will be right out to you, you'll probably receive them, you know, pending that winter storm, they would usually get to you by Tuesday or Wednesday, but it might be like next Friday or Saturday, I hope not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you need anything before the end of July, just give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that's why I'm asking, if they do work, can I call back and get them delivered to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, of course, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll give you another note, when you do call back to place an order, because I think you're going to love these, and I hope you do, just let whoever you speak with know how you want your prescription set up.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want to receive them every month, that's fine, just let them know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want them, you know, maybe you do want them regularly, though, but only every three months or something, or maybe you want to leave it on hold the full period, it's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Dale.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I hope you love these, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
