    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and—\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name? My name is Eugene Van Note.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. And then, Mr. Van Note, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 08853.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Are you at 617 Sunrise Way in Neshawna Station?\n\nSpeaker 2: I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to cancel this order, and I keep getting the runaround.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then rather than call American Express and just stop paying you, I'd rather do it—\n\nSpeaker 2: The nice way. I've sent emails. They send me back. I call. I'm on hold for like a half—\n\nSpeaker 1: Hour. I just want to cancel. I never wanted a subscription. I wanted to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. I'm sorry. Mondays and Tuesdays are the worst, just in terms—\n\nSpeaker 2: Of calls.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I apologize for the wait. Here's what I can do for you. Let's see here. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just a couple quick questions for you. You did not want the auto refill, but do you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Still... I mean, we can keep your prescription active and just switch you over to ordering—\n\nSpeaker 2: As needed. Right. That's what I ordered. I got a subscription. I have no idea, but I've—\n\nSpeaker 1: Tried to convert it, and I have no... Yeah, no. Oh, I'm sorry. You had such a pain. Let—\n\nSpeaker 2: Me go ahead and switch that over for you. Just bear in mind, though, and just full disclosure—\n\nSpeaker 1: I've completely paused this for... And I've switched it over to just order as you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: You won't get anything monthly or whatever. Just whenever you want to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Terrific. However, however, full disclosure, if in six months you do not order anything—\n\nSpeaker 2: It will send you one refill to keep your prescription active, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have no problem with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have no problem with that at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Super.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then this one right here, this one's already shipped. What's up, guy? You can either keep—\n\nSpeaker 2: It or refuse it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no. No, I'll keep it. I'm very easy to get along with.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Super.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you'd like, I can send you an email at evanote51 at yahoo.com confirming our conversation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. You're the best.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Anything else I can help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll do it. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks so much, really. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
