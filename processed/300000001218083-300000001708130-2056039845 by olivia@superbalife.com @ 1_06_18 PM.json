    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is David Poore, P-O-O-R-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi David, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been better, but I'm doing all right I guess.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, see last month when I ordered this stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was supposed to be Viagra, the new Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I chatted with somebody and told them,\n\nSpeaker 1: specifically told them if it was Cinderfuel,\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want it because I got two bottles of it at home.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, of course, that's what they sent me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And now I know almost sure that that was a one-time payment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I got a recurring payment on my bill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got billed Saturday for another month prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: that I didn't ask for, so I just need to do away with that, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they would have sent me what I wanted to begin with,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would have kept it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it was supposed to have been a one-time payment,\n\nSpeaker 1: one month to try, but Saturday I got a payment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, I couldn't talk to nobody because it was closed.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know I chatted with somebody that day and said,\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want Cinderfuel because that's what I got.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's exactly what they sent me.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says it on the bottle, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, no, I can help you with all of this.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is your dated birth, David?\n\nSpeaker 1: 4-2071.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And you're located at 800 Phillips Chapel Road, Empire, Alabama?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, so if you didn't get the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can definitely send you out, obviously, on us\n\nSpeaker 2: because you've already paid for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm happy to send you out a replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: and to make sure it's definitely the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't get a response on what I got charged Saturday?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if instead what you want to do\n\nSpeaker 2: is you can send back the one from Saturday,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're actually in a good position to do that\n\nSpeaker 2: because you haven't even received it,\n\nSpeaker 1: which means you haven't even opened it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you don't open it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can write return to sender on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as it isn't open,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can put it back in your mailbox,\n\nSpeaker 1: and your post person will bring it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you can just take it to USPS and say,\n\nSpeaker 1: hey, I want to do return to sender here,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they'll do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: They should have never sent it to me the first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I only got a one-time payment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I specifically asked for all this,\n\nSpeaker 2: but yet I got charged twice, not even what I want, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's aggravating.\n\nSpeaker 2: And now I can't even get a refund on it\n\nSpeaker 1: until it comes in the mail and I send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it doesn't been mailed out,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that was Saturday when I got charged for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the shipping department,\n\nSpeaker 1: they're a few hours ahead of us,\n\nSpeaker 2: so they're almost done with their workday,\n\nSpeaker 1: so they've been shipping all day.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they usually do start first thing\n\nSpeaker 1: with the Saturday order.\n\nSpeaker 2: How did a one-time payment become a recurring payment?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can answer that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you place your initial order with us online,\n\nSpeaker 1: and when you order with us online,\n\nSpeaker 2: there's this screen that pops up that says\n\nSpeaker 1: that every order with us will come with pharmacy refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can call this number\n\nSpeaker 1: if you want to change those refills\n\nSpeaker 2: or if you want to cancel or anything you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want to receive them so often, et cetera.\n\nSpeaker 2: And because we didn't hear from you,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's why that refill was placed.\n\nSpeaker 2: It probably pops up for a half a second or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know how all that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been through this a hundred times.\n\nSpeaker 1: They make it where you can't possibly see any of that,\n\nSpeaker 2: where you get charged the hell out of your debit card,\n\nSpeaker 1: like I've been getting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I can make sure that-\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't afford what I got,\n\nSpeaker 2: much less what I'm getting already don't want,\n\nSpeaker 1: but anyway, I know there ain't nothing you can do about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can make sure that does not happen,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can send you out the AGV\n\nSpeaker 2: because you did initially pay for it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can make sure that we don't charge you for that\n\nSpeaker 2: and that you get to try it, and then I can also-\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I wanted to originally do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's try that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna send it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship it to 800 Phillips Chapel Road,\n\nSpeaker 2: Empire, Alabama, 35063?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that'll be out to you in like three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the first one you receive,\n\nSpeaker 1: just don't open it and write return sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the one that you receive like two days later,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's yours to keep, and that's the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the way you're gonna know it's the AGV\n\nSpeaker 1: is the pill bottle itself will say AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll say Greenstone, but more importantly,\n\nSpeaker 1: the pills themselves, they're still gonna be white,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they're gonna say 100 on them,\n\nSpeaker 1: and so Cilindafil is still an active ingredient\n\nSpeaker 2: in the product and every Viagra product ever made\n\nSpeaker 1: and probably every Viagra product that'll ever be made.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure it does.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but this is-\n\nSpeaker 2: I got two bottles of Cilindafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need another bottle of that,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I specifically emailed somebody and told them that,\n\nSpeaker 1: but apparently they don't,\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, somebody answered me back that day\n\nSpeaker 1: when I specifically said if it's Cilindafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course they sent it to me, shocker.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I wish they would've left some notes\n\nSpeaker 1: in your customer service file about that, but-\n\nSpeaker 2: It should be a note somewhere where I emailed them,\n\nSpeaker 1: but whatever. Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you'll receive these probably one or two days\n\nSpeaker 1: after you receive the one that already went through\n\nSpeaker 2: that you're just gonna return immediately\n\nSpeaker 1: with return to sender as long as you don't open it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and just a reminder,\n\nSpeaker 1: you wanna make sure to take these on an empty stomach,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you wanna avoid alcohol and caffeine when you take them\n\nSpeaker 1: just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you want more, not less,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm gonna place the prescription on hold for you\n\nSpeaker 2: for the full duration I'm able to, which is six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: so if you need anything before July 27th, you can have it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I won't be charged anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the prescription is placed on hold until then,\n\nSpeaker 1: so if you need anything before then\n\nSpeaker 2: or to make any changes before July 27th,\n\nSpeaker 1: just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you, David.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good day, bye.",
