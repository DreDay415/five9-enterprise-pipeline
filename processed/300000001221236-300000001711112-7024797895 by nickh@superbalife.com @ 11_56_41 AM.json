    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hello. My name is Carl Davis and I'm calling for my subscription. It's charging me $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: This one was charged last January 20. Can you help me with this one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me pull out the account here, sir. Can I just get the phone number associated with the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it says 678-216-9814.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Davis, can you confirm the billing address on file?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's 3770 Newbury Place Drive, Luganville, Georgia, 30052.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Mr. Davis, I don't have that address on file here. Can you give me a different address?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's where I live in, Newbury Place, Luganville.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but I just need the address that we have on file here to confirm your identity is all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really, that must be on my place in Louisiana, 4001 General DeGaulle Drive, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70114.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's not on file here either.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this would be the shipping address that all these orders have gone to.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, when you've been receiving your prescription medication, what address has that gone to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are where I live in, in Georgia and Louisiana.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you've been receiving your prescription, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the address that I have here on file is not the one that you're mentioning, so the shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't access this information unless I have the proper details.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really? How could that be? Can we try my email on this one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're wishing on the phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have your phone number that you provided, and that shows me your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: To confirm identity, I need date of birth and the shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, my date of birth is April 28, 1972.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then the shipping address?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been here a long time ago in Newbury.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, you're telling me that you're receiving medication at an address that we don't have on file,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I just need you to confirm the address in which these are being shipped to, because you said you were receiving them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it doesn't sound like I can approve this right now and get into this account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need you to call back when you have the proper address.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's weird. I don't know why you don't see this one.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not on Louisiana, so it should be Georgia.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have one in Georgia, but I need the proper address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you provide me...\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this the only way to verify this one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now, I'm kind of confused.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So could you tell me the first four digits of the address at Carolina Ridge?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that one. I forgot that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been there just a short time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll just try to look at it on my notes. I'll just call again for this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
