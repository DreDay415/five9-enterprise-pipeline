    "text": "Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd like to cancel a prescription, which I've done before. Canceled before, but\n\nSpeaker 2: still got it. Let's take a look for you. What's your zip?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 32137. What's your first and last name? EWING. I'm assuming that is your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what you said last name. EWING. Oh, first and last? Okay. It's okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I got you there, sir. No, I don't see any prior cancellations. Did you send an email maybe?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, how do you have to cancel this? Well, if you sent an email, we do send a reply back to\n\nSpeaker 1: give us a phone call to cancel the sale. It's a medication, so we do need to make sure that it is\n\nSpeaker 2: the actual patient cancelling. Okay. So what was wrong with the Viagra, though, sir, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nSpeaker 1: Was it not working? No, I just don't. Did you get it too fast? No, I don't. Yeah, I don't need them. I don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and you are aware you can order this as needed. You do not have to get it the way you've been getting it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to cancel everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Amazing, we will cancel it. You will not receive it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I get a confirmation or no?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, verbal confirmation. I just cancelled your prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: out, so yeah, you will not receive this again, even if you call in and try to order later.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Your prescription would be cancelled. I swore I did this before, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I would have a phone\n\nSpeaker 2: call of it on your account here, and I don't have any phone calls of a cancellation here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I have an account number?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. No account number at all that I could access now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you can access the website. You can access your account online just\n\nSpeaker 2: through your personal information. And you can't cancel through the website?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what they're saying. Can you not cancel through the website you said?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can stop\n\nSpeaker 1: and postpone things, and you can edit your account on the website.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I would have an account, like a sign-in and stuff like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But you're all cancelled out now, so none of that really...\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all cancelled. I don't need\n\nSpeaker 2: to worry about it, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes, sir. Even if you change your mind down the line a couple years\n\nSpeaker 2: from now, you will not be able to reorder. Everything is cancelled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, appreciate it. Thank you.",
