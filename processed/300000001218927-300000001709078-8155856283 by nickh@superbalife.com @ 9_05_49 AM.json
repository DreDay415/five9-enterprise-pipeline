    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, yes, I just want to cancel this automatically here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your account, sir,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll get this resolved for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is George, and the last name is Getz, G-O-E-T-Z.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my date of birth is 03-05-1962.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, George.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm looking at your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like it's for the 100 milligram Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You initially was written on December 20th of last year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, and it looks like the doctor wrote it with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what month, OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, George, I'm glad you called.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not required to get this every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is by no means a subscription\n\nSpeaker 1: in which you are required to get it on a certain schedule.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is perfectly adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some patients do monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some patients do bimonthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some patients will simply put an extended pause on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: which will allow them to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: That allows them to keep their access\n\nSpeaker 2: to the remaining refills under the script.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, I could just do that for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you can call in anytime you want a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so upon cancellation,\n\nSpeaker 1: it does close out the prescription altogether,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you would lose access to the remaining 10 that you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, from my notes to the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: did you have some issues with the medication?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I feel like it wasn't what it was supposed to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: In what regard?\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's, you know, in the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: in the ads or whatever, you're like,\n\nSpeaker 1: oh, it starts in 11 or 15 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it doesn't, the label even says take an hour before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, George...\n\nSpeaker 2: There's nothing special about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just generic, specific, though, or however you say it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I can get through my doctor a lot cheaper.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, well, George, well, what I'm seeing here\n\nSpeaker 2: is you didn't receive the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: That wasn't what was selected online.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to get you them\n\nSpeaker 1: so you actually have a chance to try it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's what I wanted,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's what they said I was gonna get.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I didn't get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take a look at your,\n\nSpeaker 2: do you have the bottle in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to clarify something,\n\nSpeaker 2: because if you didn't receive the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll get you replacements for you to try for free,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'll actually have the opportunity\n\nSpeaker 1: to try the proper medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you received the generic\n\nSpeaker 1: and you meant to get the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get this fixed for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I got the generic, and it's kind of upsetting, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So tell me on the bottom of the label.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna do it that way, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I got 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: a little bit, just from my doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you receive the wrong thing,\n\nSpeaker 2: I will get this fixed for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll make sure you get the right thing to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: So could you tell me on the bottom right of that bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: what it says?\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it say Apco Pharma, or does it say Greenstone?\n\nSpeaker 1: Apco Pharma.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, so Apco Pharma is a leading generic company\n\nSpeaker 2: here in the United States.\n\nSpeaker 1: ScoreBlue and GoGoMeds, they supply generic,\n\nSpeaker 2: they sell the regular, and they sell the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So sometimes those things get mixed up,\n\nSpeaker 2: which isn't ideal, especially with the ordering system online.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not a big fan of the website\n\nSpeaker 2: because we see these mistakes more often than we should.\n\nSpeaker 1: That being said, allow me to just send you a replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: of the Viagra AGV so you can actually see the difference\n\nSpeaker 1: and try it for yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could simply put your account on a pause, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you can just get back to me\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how those AGV worked out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got like 30 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've used one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, so you don't, you can,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna replace them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm gonna get you the proper medication,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I want you to allow me to do that so you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, like I said, the AGV is different\n\nSpeaker 2: than what you received.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I tried to order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, and it was like,\n\nSpeaker 1: oh, congratulations, you'll get the AGV or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I get it, and there's just a plain white pill with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, well, George, I'm trying to get this fixed for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and what I see on my end, I don't know what happened,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the doctor wrote it for Cidenafil Generic,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's what went to the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can get you the AGV, though, if you want me to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can reach out to the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll get this fixed for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's what I was interested in trying.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't have any intention to get Cidenafil Generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: I paid 10 bucks for 10 pills from my pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, so George, would you like me\n\nSpeaker 2: to send you those replacements?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, how many are you gonna send me?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm gonna send you, I want you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna send you 30 replacements,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's gonna be all of them, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm gonna do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna put your account on a pause, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then once you have the opportunity\n\nSpeaker 1: to try the new medication, I want you to get back to me\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how it worked for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: At my age, I only use it maybe once every couple weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yeah, I'll be happy to get back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm gonna get this taken care of for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna put the request in today.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is coming from Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I don't see them having any delays\n\nSpeaker 2: because they haven't really been affected\n\nSpeaker 1: by the weather right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're up there in Illinois,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it should be pretty straightforward,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you might get it by the end of the week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you have the full instructions too,\n\nSpeaker 1: like take it on an empty stomach and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, we'll say take it on an empty stomach,\n\nSpeaker 1: avoid taking it with alcohol, even caffeine, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Now it will still say take it an hour before sex,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it will kick in faster than that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just legal protections,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you can expect it to kick in faster\n\nSpeaker 2: as long as it's taken as prescribed.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds good, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, and on the bottle, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 2: expect it to say Greenstone,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's how you know it's coming from France,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the pill won't have a generic code.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yours probably say AC340.\n\nSpeaker 2: The ones that you're getting are from Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 1: so they will say 100 for the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's just confusing\n\nSpeaker 1: because they use the score blue top\n\nSpeaker 2: on the bottle and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, score blue is an LL service,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we have patients that still take generic Viagra, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because we sell generic Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's even an option on the dropdown\n\nSpeaker 1: when you buy it online,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we sell the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we sell regular Viagra, and we sell Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: So across the board, we sell that on score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't love our website.\n\nSpeaker 2: We are pretty much a telehealth service over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: So like I said, this isn't the first time\n\nSpeaker 2: I've seen this mistake happen with the online website,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm not a big fan of it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I want to get this resolved for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just always give us a call, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's what I'm doing, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want it taken out again next month,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm not even using it at that rate.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it didn't work any better\n\nSpeaker 1: than my generic blue ones that I get from my,\n\nSpeaker 2: it was the same effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which is okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking for better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you know, that's why I wanted to try the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, happy to help anytime, George.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, give me a call back\n\nSpeaker 1: once you've had the time to try the medication, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and if you need any of these returns, let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you're welcome to put return to sender\n\nSpeaker 2: on that most recent one if you want to send that one back,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I can just get your replacements\n\nSpeaker 2: for the larger order, your initial order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I didn't,\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't keep the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: With the envelope, I mean, I got the body.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can use the new envelope that this one's gonna come in,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what, do you refund the money for that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, so, well, if you want 30,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can replace it with 30, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'd rather me just replace the initial, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want me to replace the initial order of 20?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can do that as well,\n\nSpeaker 1: and all you need to do is return back the 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you put it back on my card,\n\nSpeaker 1: the $65 or whatever it was back on the card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll do that with the new packaging.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what do I do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just put it in the larger envelope\n\nSpeaker 1: and send it to the same address?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when the new delivery will arrive in a plastic envelope,\n\nSpeaker 1: just neatly open that one up, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your replacement bill,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm gonna then send you 20, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So take that bottle out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can put that most recent delivery of 10\n\nSpeaker 2: in there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then just tape it up neatly\n\nSpeaker 1: and put return to sender on that package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, right on the outside of it, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, very good, I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long before you see the return in the bank account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Typically, two to five business days\n\nSpeaker 2: once it's filed here at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, once you get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, George.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's all set and taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can expect that here within the week, I assume, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome, happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
