    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and\n\nSpeaker 2: last name? Yes, ma'am. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking\n\nSpeaker 1: my call. My first name is Edward, and my last name is Leary, L-E-A-R-Y.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Mr. Leary, what can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't understand what's going on. I've had pretty good rapport and relationship\n\nSpeaker 2: with Score Blue, but I just checked my credit card, and I'm getting another prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: sent three months in a row, and it's a 90-day prescription. I thought last month was a mistake,\n\nSpeaker 2: but now it's going to happen again this month. That's crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that can't... Yeah, let's... Hold on a second, Mr. Leary. Can you just verify your\n\nSpeaker 2: zip code for me? Yeah, 34986.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, this is wrong. Hold on one second. I'm going to cancel the one that was just\n\nSpeaker 2: charged yesterday. Okay, great, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, 14395, okay? So, let's go ahead and... Yeah, because you're already talking to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your name? It doesn't even matter.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your name? My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stephanie? No, Jessie, J-E-S-S-I-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Jessie, you're really being helpful, and you're a stress reliever. I didn't catch\n\nSpeaker 2: what you last said. Something about this is wrong, and then...\n\nSpeaker 1: There is no... First off, this right here is not a... You're not on any kind of auto-anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. So, for it to have charged you again so soon\n\nSpeaker 1: looks like some kind of a system issue. Number two, the pharmacy isn't going to release that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's too soon, so that's why... All of these adding up, this is definitely a... This is\n\nSpeaker 1: a glitch. This is a system glitch. I'm going to send it over to our admin team to ensure\n\nSpeaker 2: that you don't get charged. Okay, great. And, Jessie, even last month,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you look at last month, they sent it two months in a row, and it's a 90-day prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's really... So, I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe I'll have enough energy. At my age, though, that's doubtful. But anyway, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm okay with that. But if you correct this, Jessie, that would be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. I went ahead and refunded the $163.95 to you because that's clearly a mistake\n\nSpeaker 2: on our part. It's a system issue. I'll send it over to our admin team, but expect that\n\nSpeaker 1: $163.95 back onto your card in three to five days. I've processed it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just takes your credit card... You know, they take forever to post anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's okay. I'm not so worried. I just don't want them to keep sending me every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And I'm not on auto-ship.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you're not. This package is not at all. This is as you go. So, that's why I was just like,\n\nSpeaker 2: why is it doing that? That's weird. Okay? Okay, you're very nice, and I would also like to say\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to compliment you, first of all, but I would compliment Score Blue because I'm 99% sure\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm talking to an American lady who is in the United States and not someone I can't understand\n\nSpeaker 1: that's in ju-ju-goo-goo-goo. I hear you. I hear you. Nope. We're all here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Well, thank you so much for your time. You have a good day. Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
