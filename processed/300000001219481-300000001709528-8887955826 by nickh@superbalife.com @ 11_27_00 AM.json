    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hello. I want to discontinue auto retail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can help you with that. Can I get the phone number associated with the account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's 305-600-7948.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is Mark Anthony, 11-23-54.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mark, appreciate that. I do see here you're a VIP at ScoreBlue, so we appreciate you being a patient since 2023.\n\nSpeaker 1: That being said, you do have some special privileges here. You aren't required to get this monthly, bimonthly, or trimonthly in the case that you've currently been doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted, rather than canceling it, you could simply put this on an extended pause, and that would allow you to call in and place future orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think that'll be necessary. If I do end up wanting to renew, I can just give you the call, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, but you would see some adjustments, so you would lose VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that means is, right now you're locked in at a very special rate for your prescription. You would see a significant increase later down the road. Pausing it keeps you locked in at that price.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll pass on that. I don't anticipate probably needing it, and if it comes down to that, I can just go to my primary care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now Mark, have you, and lastly, my last little question for you is, have you had the opportunity to try the new Viagra AGV, which is the newest formula from Pfizer in France?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but I really wouldn't be interested in that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I was going to say, if you wanted, I could always send you a sample. It is the newest formula, more effective, and is a little bit more cost effective.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but thank you. I appreciate the offer, but thank you, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, Mark, I will go ahead and cancel this for you. This will close out the prescription altogether, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
