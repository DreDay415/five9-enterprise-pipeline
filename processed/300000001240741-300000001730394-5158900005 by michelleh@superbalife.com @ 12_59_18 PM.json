How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I had a question on an existing order that I purchased.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I called earlier, but he wanted to, I guess, he needed some questions with the pills that are right in front of me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why I'm calling back. No, I'm Joshua. Can you just confirm a date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 to 75.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much if you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what's imprinted on your pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I got the generics, the dentifil, which the AVG is the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Version, but these are the ones I believe they say they take.\n\nSpeaker 2: 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: They sent you the incorrect medication. Give me one second. I'm gonna get you out. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, he thought so, but he wanted to make sure on it. Yeah. Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, so when you get this new bottle in the mail, this is how you can confirm you receive the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to say Greenstone LLC on the bottle, and Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: France that we're contracted with and—\n\nSpeaker 2: Then on the individual pills, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And okay. Yeah, because right now your bottle says APCO and on your pills—\n\nSpeaker 2: It has the number, the letters AC imprinted followed by the numbers—\n\nSpeaker 1: 390, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: 40, okay. Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so they're no good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they're just regular generics. They're not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Well, I appreciate that. I—yeah, I thought I did but then I'm like, okay, I questioned myself maybe, but no, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, so people do say they don't kick in in 11 to 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: But on the bottle it will definitely say take one hour prior, you know, for the full result.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like a plan. I appreciate that very much. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you do. All right. Thanks.",
