    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. Hi. How's it going? So, um, I've been getting a prescription from you guys,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I need to cancel. It's been giving me a pretty bad headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, really? I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see what's going on with your account\n\nSpeaker 1: and see what I can do for you. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Christopher, I do have your account up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you're currently getting the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you're getting 25 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you're getting them every other month.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I'm really concerned about is you telling me that they were giving you a headache, Christopher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're giving me a headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I read the instructions, and I read about, like, side effects of it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I really haven't been able to take them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've taken probably maybe six of them so far,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it just seems like every time I take them, I get a pretty bad headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'd just, yeah, I'd rather cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me tell you what I'm going to do for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and stop those bimonthly shipments that you're getting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to stop those monthly refills that was included in your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to stop the bimonthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this one you did have an order just went out a few days ago, too, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my last question, because I do see that you are VIP, what I want to do,\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to send you out ten of these new ones that we have that's supposed to not\n\nSpeaker 2: have those same side effects for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to charge you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm not going to put you on any type of every month's prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm only going to send you out ten of them just for you to try,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I see you've been with us for a while,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I would hate for you to not be able to use the ones that you got.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do want you to be able to have something that's going to help you\n\nSpeaker 1: that's not going to give you those same side effects or headaches.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's what I'd like to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you ten of these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to have you on any type of, like I said, again, every monthly thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to give you like about four or five months to try these ten.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that does, that keeps your prescription active,\n\nSpeaker 2: so if you do like them and you want to order them,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can get these instead of what you were getting before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to get that other one that you have coming to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the ones I'm going to send you is only going to be ten, no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: And let me tell you the difference with these.\n\nSpeaker 2: These are going to be the same white-shaped diamond pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: but they're going to have the number 1-0-0 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's going to be the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I guarantee you're not going to have that same side effect\n\nSpeaker 2: that you was having with these when you try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to set it up so you're not going to get any refills automatically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, again, I'm pausing all prescriptions,\n\nSpeaker 1: but, like, I'm going to do five months for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give you a chance to try these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you do want to order before then,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'll get the ones that I send you out with the 1-0-0 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So once I get those and I like them, I can actually, if I do,\n\nSpeaker 2: if they don't give me the headaches and stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can just call this number and get those going, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I recommend you call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't do it online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call us so, therefore, you get the right one that I'm sending you out\n\nSpeaker 2: when you get them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, like I said, again, I'm only sending you ten for right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, Christopher.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure these are going to work better for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're going to see a big difference out of these.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
