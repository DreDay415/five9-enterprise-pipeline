    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm calling to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me see if I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try to pull up your account and take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Joseph I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Joseph. I do have you up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see you're getting the Viagra, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you're getting 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescription is getting you 10 every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that too frequently for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: We can pause it out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, again, this happens too often.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's supposed to have been like that, but no.\n\nSpeaker 1: They kept sending it to me every month and charging me $65.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want that, we don't want to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can set it up so it's only happening like twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to go ahead and do that for you so you keep your prescription active on call\n\nSpeaker 1: so you're not getting them every month?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want them every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no problem. I can set it up so like once every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would that work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, once every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if that's too frequently, you can still always call and push it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, for instance, like I say, again, you were scheduled to get another one on the 17th.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to stop that one right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I'm going to do, I'm going to make it so you only get them like twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what this does, it allows you to order whenever you want to order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and plus if six months come too soon, you can just call us and say,\n\nSpeaker 2: push me back some more months, I'm still fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're looking at like in the middle of July.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if that's too soon, you can always call and say, push me back another four or five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay, I'll go with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I'll just take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: So tell me, excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. I'm here. I'm here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that won't happen until July?\n\nSpeaker 1: July, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it will be every six months after that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it won't be every month again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said so for like twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
