    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I just got charged for another order of Score Blue, but I never even received my first order.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Williams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your zip code, Mr. Williams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Eight seven one zero eight.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the first name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Terry.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty. Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow, yeah, I do see that here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You—\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me just a second, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You—\n\nSpeaker 2: The first order came back to us. I'm not sure why.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, did you want—did you want to get one of these orders, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I wanted the first order and then I just looked and they just charged me for a second order. I didn't even, you know—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the second order—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's weird too because it wasn't even 30 days later. It was like 35 days later.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually, like when they set you up on that VIP prescription thing, it's like 30, 60, 90 days later, but there's 35.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it might have been a little glitch in the system. What I can do for you, Mr—\n\nSpeaker 1: Williams is I can pause this account for up to six months for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give you some time to try these pills out when we actually are able to get them to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see here on FedEx it says it was returned to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, I can cancel that order out for you. Don't want the second one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want me to cancel? I want to refund it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go ahead and do that and then the first order started that, so don't worry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was not gonna come. You're gonna see it refunded to your card.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second or the first order? I just don't know why I didn't get there though. Are you at—what's your address?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1-1-12 Nevada Drive Northeast.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're like a letter C?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, apartment C.\n\nSpeaker 2: Albuquerque, New Mexico 87108.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes. I definitely—I'm gonna reship this to you. I'll get the overnight to you again as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why I didn't get there though.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says you're unable to deliver shipment, but it doesn't have a reason why. It says delivery exception.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can be received. I didn't even get a note or nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't know if I can give you the gate number or do I have to give it to FedEx?\n\nSpeaker 2: This FedEx, I mean, they should already know. I feel like the gate number, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do love, like, an apartment complex.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm sure people are getting FedEx delivery, so you would think they would have access to get into the complex, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, I definitely—I'm gonna reship this to you. It's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want me to send this FedEx or do you want me to send this USPS? Whatever you think is safest.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, USPS. I know, I know the mailman has—\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. So yeah, I'm gonna go ahead. I'm gonna take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna reship this order and then I'll pause this account for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have some time to try the pills but like nothing else will come out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give us a call back before July once you get a chance to try these. You'll see this order, Mr. Williams, come before—\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll show up before this upcoming Friday or by this Friday latest, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you, man. I really appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem and you're all set. Okay, let us know how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Have a good day.",
