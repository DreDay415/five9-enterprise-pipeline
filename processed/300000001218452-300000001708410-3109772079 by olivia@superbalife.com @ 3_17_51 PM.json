    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viacra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Max Lopez.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Max. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. I'd like to cancel my prescription. I sent a text message and they didn't cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm still getting prescriptions and I don't want it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay, Max, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: January 23, 1956.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Happy birthday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and are you located at 1700 Red Dawn View Circle, Corona, California, 92882?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, if you don't want to receive those regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option with your prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you wanted to order before late July, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I just want to cancel it. I'm not going to use it in the product payment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, just so you know, if the pills don't work for you, it looks like,\n\nSpeaker 1: well, it is my job to let you know, it looks like you qualify for a free sample of our newest product,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is a superior prescription to your current one.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made, and it comes from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way the free sample would work is the free sample is 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you want to think about it like, you know, you don't need this prescription because it doesn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it would be replaced by these 10 pills of this free sample,\n\nSpeaker 1: which start a new script that would be placed on hold for you for kind of like a five-month free trial or until July.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what we think would happen is you try them out, you'd like them, you would run out of them,\n\nSpeaker 1: you would give us a call within the next two to five months to order some, and then we might be able to get you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't think I want to try any. I just really just want to cancel it, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's fine. All right, well, you know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here, and we are the only sellers of that product that you haven't tried in the U.S. and in the entire world.\n\nSpeaker 1: We paid a lot of money to be able to say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we'd love to have you back at a later date.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample of the product. You'd just have to purchase it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I hope you have a great day, Max, and if you need anything, you know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thanks. Bye.",
