My name is Mark Kretschmer, and I had subscribed online, and then I had an e-mail that told me that my prescription was sent to my pharmacy, but the pharmacy never received anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sorry for the confusion. That means it's sent to our pharmacy, and then our pharmacy mails it to your home.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Can we confirm that that happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I need your zip code, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: I need your zip code as well, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: 08831?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1 Overlook Drive in Monroe Township?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. It is at our pharmacy. That pharmacy is located in Kentucky, so they'll mail it to that address, the unit 1144.\n\nSpeaker 2: It processed at our pharmacy today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because of the snow, they're dealing with it, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are running a little bit of limited hours, so it may take an extra day to go out,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it will go out from them here within a day or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool. Very good. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Mark.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
