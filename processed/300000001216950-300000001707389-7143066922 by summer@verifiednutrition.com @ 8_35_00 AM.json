    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Customer Service, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I have an account with you guys and you guys keep charging me and somehow it's on auto refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I did not, I don't want that. You guys just charged me right now $63 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just want to refund it. I don't want the prescription sent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm on your website right now. There's no way I can cancel it or alter it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you have to call in to do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name and birthday? I'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: 12-24-1969.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then what's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jack Rodriguez.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Jack. Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I altered it and I paused it, so you just have to call in to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you could do it online, but I would suggest calling in so you don't run into it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can't cancel it altogether?\n\nSpeaker 1: Cancel what? Your account or?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if I paused it somehow, and I believe I paused it before, and somehow it just kept charging me, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you have to call in and pause. You can't pause online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I cancel it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me go ahead and cancel this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The order that was from yesterday went out already, so when you receive it, you just have to send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but when are you going to refund my money? Because I didn't ask for it to be sent out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys sent it out automatically, so that's on you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you place the order online.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want my money refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me talk.\n\nSpeaker 2: So once you place the order online, there was a box for you to uncheck.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how it got on a monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you receive the package and the mail person scans the package back, it's going to automatically trigger the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I never signed for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a lot of times I'm not even home.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you don't have to be home to get it. You just have to return it back to the mailman or back to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do you do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You drop it off or you hand it back to the mailman you don't want it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I ain't got time for all that. I'm a busy guy. I'm in and out of this house, and I'm not here a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm saying. I don't have to deal with all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you cancel my account completely?\n\nSpeaker 2: I did cancel your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I make sure that my card's not going to be charged again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send me some email confirmation?\n\nSpeaker 2: You should get a notification email once I select it to cancel out, but your entire account is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you receive the packaging from the pharmacy, you just have to return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.",
