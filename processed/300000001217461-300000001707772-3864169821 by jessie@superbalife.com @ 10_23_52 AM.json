    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, I thought I was calling Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: We just answered Viagra because it's our main product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Scor-Blue and how about Blue too, is it the same office, same company?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, two completely different services, two completely different products.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ours is FDA approved and it comes from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's real Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Blue too is like gummies and they're not, they're not FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, two different companies.\n\nSpeaker 2: What can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably not, probably not very good, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not really.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, like suspension gummies aren't known to be effective.\n\nSpeaker 2: For some people they are, but for a majority, they're not really.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull this up and I'm so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My first name, Donald.\n\nSpeaker 1: Last name, McInnes, M-C-I-N-N-I-S.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what is your zip code, Mr.\n\nSpeaker 2: McInnes?\n\nSpeaker 1: 04462 up here in Northern Maine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a friend from Maine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see here, 507 Penobscot Avenue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, Millnocket, Maine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you ordered, um, the hundred milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where was your friend from?\n\nSpeaker 2: Somewhere in Maine?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know the exact place.\n\nSpeaker 2: All I know is that they have like a beautiful lake house kind of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you don't know any of it now, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I should and go and visit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Come here in the summer if you do.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the winters there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: About 12 degrees.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know where you're located, man, but it's 12 degrees outside right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not very warm.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a hard pass.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're in Southern California, so we're, we're, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Mr.\n\nSpeaker 2: McInnes, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oof.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So because you live in the state of Maine and Maine is one of the few states that\n\nSpeaker 2: requires some form of consent before the doctor can continue, um, we can do one of\n\nSpeaker 1: two things.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the one way to do it is to send a five second video.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that's too much of a hassle, the video is something that you take with your\n\nSpeaker 2: phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that's a technological hassle, I can just have the doctor call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know what, what's easiest.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I just made a video a few minutes ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't, I thought it was going to school.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: It did not upload.\n\nSpeaker 1: But why don't I do this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you still have the video on your phone?\n\nSpeaker 1: Cause I can send you a direct text message and you can attach it to, hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see if I can find it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just didn't know myself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, I.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Checking my photo library.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Videos.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh,\n\nSpeaker 1: no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, yeah, I got the, uh, hello, Mr.\n\nSpeaker 1: McGinnis.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got some message.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you find that video on, in, in your pictures gallery, um, you can attach the\n\nSpeaker 2: video or reply back to the video and I'll upload it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't have to, you know, be bothered with that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: If the system can be a bit finicky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why that didn't, uh, upload.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, super.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, so once we get it, we'll, we'll reply back to you, um, in the text.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you know that we received it and then we'll send it off to the\n\nSpeaker 1: doctor so they can review it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once everything's all checked out, you'll, you'll receive a notification\n\nSpeaker 2: through email and text that it's been approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then you'll get a tracking number in 24 to 48 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you'll get your meds in the mail in under a week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it can't be, then you get a full refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What, uh, what kind of, how much of the pills were they, I mean, they order\n\nSpeaker 1: like say 10 of them or something, or maybe just five, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: The goal is what's the price?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm wondering how much they cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, you ordered 10, uh, the package price is $49 after taxes\n\nSpeaker 2: and fees, it comes out to 6,395.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: For a package of 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: For a package of 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not too bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, um, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you send over that video, we'll take care of the rest for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
