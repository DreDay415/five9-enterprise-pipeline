    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Steve, Mr. Vaughn?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but thank you so much for being patient and waiting and as a veteran I take a lot\n\nSpeaker 2: of pride in all of my work and I did exactly what you wanted and my fingerprints are on\n\nSpeaker 1: this budge so I did exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did three things actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second thing is I overrode the system and I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the third thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I paused\n\nSpeaker 2: your prescription and I looked at your chart and I'm just going to be completely candid\n\nSpeaker 1: with you because this grinds my gears.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't see it all the time but I made it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw and I looked at your chart deeper in it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You never got the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you got the basic Viagra and we only make three pills and should it be\n\nSpeaker 2: the pharmacy that sent you the wrong things, I ensure that you got the same thing, the\n\nSpeaker 1: one you wanted, the AGV because when I read you the chart it was 50 milligrams but when\n\nSpeaker 2: I looked further into the chart they sent you the Sidenafil which that's not the right\n\nSpeaker 1: one.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I billed the doctor, I sent you 30 pills to make you whole again and I put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 1: everything in its entirety and I paused your prescription and I set it up where when you\n\nSpeaker 2: call me, you let me know and we can go from there, all right, but I'm so sorry about that\n\nSpeaker 1: snafu but I want to be completely transparent with you because that's what us Americans\n\nSpeaker 2: do.\n\nSpeaker 1: We look out for each other and we always do what's right but okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Please take down, Mr. Vaughn, my extension so you can just deal with me moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0037 and my name is KT like killer Texas or killer tomato and last name\n\nSpeaker 2: is Goodrich's Entire.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get these, Mr. Vaughn, they're going to look the same but it's nice and sandy on\n\nSpeaker 2: the top and it's smooth in the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to mark the milligrams on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to say 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please do not take more than two in a 24-hour period and don't take them with any oily food\n\nSpeaker 2: or any type of highly ultra processed food because it's a time release and a lot of times\n\nSpeaker 1: these fake foods, the chemicals cancels out the time release which if you take it on a\n\nSpeaker 2: light whole food diet, it should activate in about 15 to 20 minutes and it goes about\n\nSpeaker 1: 8 to 12 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on the 100 milligrams and when you do like these, give me the thumbs up and we'll\n\nSpeaker 2: go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: What did you say your last name was?\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodrich as Entire.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so KT Goodrich and sir, I just want to pray for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to say, therefore, I say to you, Mark 11:24, therefore, whatever things I say to\n\nSpeaker 1: you, Mr. Steve Vaughn, that when you ask, when you pray, believe in your heart that\n\nSpeaker 2: you receive them and you'll have them in Jesus' mighty name because we lost 58 men and women\n\nSpeaker 1: over the weekend, especially in your area because of the weather, you know, so I'm praying\n\nSpeaker 2: for you guys for your safety, your security, and your well being over there.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I bless you guys there in South Dakota, Alabama, you name it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I'm talking about was really, really horrendous and ratchet weather, you\n\nSpeaker 2: know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Be on the lookout for it, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you and call me if you need anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't leave a voice now.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you get someone else, just tell them, this is Mr. Vaughn, KT knows who I am, tell\n\nSpeaker 1: him to call me and I will call you back that hour or that day.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't chase the voicemail, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a question though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: These that I have are the wrong ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Pfizer makes three Viagras.\n\nSpeaker 1: We make the blue $100 pill, the original branded Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: We make the basic Viagra, which is AC 340 or 339.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get that from Walgreens, CVS, or any pharmacy I get it from the VA for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the AGV has a marking of 50 on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: We either make 25, 50, or hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get these, pull out the pill and you'll see it says five zero on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you got is good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're just not the AGV and it's not strong enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those are good for like someone in their twenties or thirties, you know, at our age,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, like you're, you're about 12 years older than me, but at our age, you know, we\n\nSpeaker 1: need, we need an AR 15.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't need no Daisy BB gun, if you know what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how we roll.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, we're American, so we're commalled and commissioned to bleed red, white and blue\n\nSpeaker 2: all day, every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, KT, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stay safe and stay dry and warm, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
