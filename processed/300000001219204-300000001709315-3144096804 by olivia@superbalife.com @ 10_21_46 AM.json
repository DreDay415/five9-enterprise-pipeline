This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Anthony Rule.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, who is this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Anthony Rule.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Anthony. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty good. How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. Good. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: How do I cancel my prescriptions?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can look into this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-22-1968.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 3957 Zell Circle, Rulo, DeSoto, Missouri?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Yeah, I see that you just received the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did they not work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not like I wanted them to, so I'm just going to go ahead and cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, just so you know, Anthony, you do qualify if you were interested\n\nSpeaker 2: if the current pills that you ordered, if that prescription doesn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do qualify for a free sample of our newest, highest quality product.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is our fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it is a superior prescription to yours.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is we specifically formulated it to cut out\n\nSpeaker 1: the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it is really good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the free sample, it would be 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'd send you 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're in Missouri, so you'd probably get them by the end of the week.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it comes with a five-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'd have until June to try them out, make sure you love them,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you prefer them to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 1: What we believe would happen is by June you'd definitely run out of pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd really love them, and you'd give us a call to order some\n\nSpeaker 1: within the next two to five months, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that would make it worth it to us, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not, you'd just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until June\n\nSpeaker 2: to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is a great product, and it is a superior product to your current prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: if you did want to try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess I'll try them, see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, they're free, so that's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're at 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what you were approved for, so that's what I'm going to send you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship this sample to 3957 Zell Circle, Rulo, DeSoto, Missouri, 63020?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, I would usually say these will probably be to you by Thursday or Friday,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you know that storm is crazy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fingers crossed Friday or Saturday, Monday or Tuesday at the latest, I'm sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you need anything before June,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're always here at this phone number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, thank you so much, Anthony.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
