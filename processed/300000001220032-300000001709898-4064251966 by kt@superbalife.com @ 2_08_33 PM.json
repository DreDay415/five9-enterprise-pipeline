    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey John, so I went ahead and did exactly what you wanted because this doctor didn't\n\nSpeaker 2: inform you that he sent refills on his behalf.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do is do two things, actually three.\n\nSpeaker 2: Number one, we're canceling this guy out.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not going to use him anymore for you in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Number two is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills and I put a stop to any and\n\nSpeaker 1: all monthly charges and I certainly put a stop to any and all monthly shipments and\n\nSpeaker 2: I paused your prescription and I elevated your lead status so you could get it on your\n\nSpeaker 1: own.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in light of everything that you've got, I made some adjustments to 10 quantity and\n\nSpeaker 1: you know I noticed in your chart it said three things here and just correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: It said have patient Dublin ever experienced any hardness erection within a 30 to 60 minute\n\nSpeaker 1: period?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, no?\n\nSpeaker 1: Have I, have I what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you ever, have you experienced hardness or erection within a 30 to 60 minute period\n\nSpeaker 1: while taking the 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've had to take two.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay see, this is good, good feedback.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you ever experienced any hardness or erection within a prolonged four to six hour\n\nSpeaker 1: period?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then have you ever experienced any adverse side effects other than hardness or erection\n\nSpeaker 1: within a 24 hour period?\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing that I, I get a little dizzy and light headed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's exactly good news.\n\nSpeaker 2: No but that's good news and here's where it's why, because it doesn't work for your physiology\n\nSpeaker 1: that you're tending.\n\nSpeaker 2: So keep what you have, this batch that you've got going on, take it, hold on to it, they\n\nSpeaker 1: just don't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'd like you to do is you return to sender on this last batch for the 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do is I'm going to replace that of 25 with something more beautiful,\n\nSpeaker 2: more powerful with little to no side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: So on this 50 milligram that I send you, it'll be 25 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to get them by Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a white bounty pill, they're going to look identical, it's going to say 50 on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you take them, it says here on the chart that you don't take it when he ultra\n\nSpeaker 2: processed food, no ultra processed oils, no Tomahawks and T-bone steaks, because it's\n\nSpeaker 1: all about absorption.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you take it with water, it goes smooth down the esophagus with little to no side\n\nSpeaker 1: effects, no indigestion, no heartburn.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it disperse like a grenade that goes, shoots to the inner lining of your gut\n\nSpeaker 1: membrane, which sends a message to your hippocampus, then it tells your brain to send 70 to 80%\n\nSpeaker 2: of blood to your joints and resulting into like, I don't know if you've ever seen a baby's\n\nSpeaker 1: hand holding up an apple, you ever seen a baby's arm hold an apple, long, big and strong\n\nSpeaker 2: brother, just know that we'll make this right, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So refuse that and then I'll send you something that's better because your money's no good\n\nSpeaker 2: unless we can take good care of you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I put a stop to everything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the 25 that I'm going to send you, please reject them and refuse them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't open it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: The ones that are coming right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: The ones that are coming.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they're going to come.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're supposed to be here today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so what you do is you write, take a big circle, circle the address and write big,\n\nSpeaker 1: refuse, return to sender and just drop it in a blue box of USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have a tracking number on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll come back to us and then I'm going to be sending out today the 25 for last month\n\nSpeaker 2: plus I'll get you the money back for this month because you didn't authorize that refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: right bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: So is my...\n\nSpeaker 1: After this, am I done?\n\nSpeaker 2: My subscription's canceled?\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's no such thing as subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: What it was was Dr. Paul Drummerbeam has ordered the pharmacy to send you refills on his behalf,\n\nSpeaker 1: but we're going to fire that guy, give you another doctor, but we're not even going to\n\nSpeaker 2: go there until we can get things to work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now we're going to throw you a herald Mary, you're going to reject this shipment that\n\nSpeaker 2: gets here today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to start the credit process for the 113 and I'm going to replace the 1121\n\nSpeaker 2: that never worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that sound right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds good, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to go a different route.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What route do you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've got another, like I'm going on another company that I'm doing some other\n\nSpeaker 1: stuff with and they offer this and so I want to try them first.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I want to get rid of what you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they don't work, then I'm going to call you guys back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, here's the thing is you're already paid for all this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about any future charges or present charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: All I'm saying is to make things right, you're already paid for this batch.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just reject it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll credit you with your money and then you're going to replace it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Place this one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because here's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: No money, John.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: In November, you paid.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're Americans, but we've got to make it right.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to give you something that's stronger and better and that's good to know that it\n\nSpeaker 1: didn't work because that's a starting point.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second thing, this one that's going to land there tonight, you're rejecting it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So next week, you call me, we release the funds to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: We got to make it whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not no Chinese or some Korean company that's off seas.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're full-blown Americans, bud, and if you call ICE over here, everyone will always have\n\nSpeaker 1: their job because we're not fleeing from our country.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're Americans.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just be wary, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just be wary about those other companies across the seas that don't even want to pick up the\n\nSpeaker 2: damn phone, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're veterans.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a whole different company.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is American right here, right close to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So roll that play with them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can run a side-by-side because you're already in with us, but you don't get any\n\nSpeaker 1: charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're just making you whole, making it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But run a side-by-side, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: The ones that I have now, when I take two, it works, rather than a little bit of dizziness,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's not horrible, but just a little bit of lightheadedness with two, so 100 mils.\n\nSpeaker 2: So here's where I'm at.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just keep those.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll make, just keep those, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'll do then is I'll send you 10 to replace what doesn't give you a side effect.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this 01 batch, this January 21st, reject it and we'll credit your account, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when you try the ones that I'm giving you to replace November, we can always get\n\nSpeaker 2: you more of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you have to keep in mind what I'm going to send you, bud, is 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be a white diamond pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you 10, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: But here's where I'm at.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want more of these, you call me at 0037 because we're all sold out of these.\n\nSpeaker 2: Men love them because you can do exactly what you said is take two.\n\nSpeaker 1: But because that previous batch gave you headaches, this one is beautiful because there's no side\n\nSpeaker 2: effects, little to nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's just beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 2: So why wouldn't I have got to give me those in the beginning?\n\nSpeaker 1: It could have been an oversight, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I read your script, remember I was telling you it said 50 milligrams, but it didn't say\n\nSpeaker 1: AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not even sure what you got unless you pull out those pills now and you read what's\n\nSpeaker 1: on the actual tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you do that for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on just a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to look on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, not on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the tablet itself, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get the slide up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fifty.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all it says.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you did get the right one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't need to replace them because typically what happens is that's why it's giving you\n\nSpeaker 2: a headache because they're too strong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what you'll do in light of, if it says 50, that's exactly what you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I'll do in light of what you're saying, because it does take a side effect of when\n\nSpeaker 1: you take two, I'll do a forced consult, change your doctor, and just send you ten of the\n\nSpeaker 2: hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you just take one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if two fifties aren't two fifties the same as a hundred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's true too, but you said you get a headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's just hold off then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll pause your prescription like I said, and then if you like, so just hold what you\n\nSpeaker 1: got then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just hold off on everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take down my number then.\n\nSpeaker 2: My number is 0037 because if you got the fifties, we're all sold out of this since January.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, since December.\n\nSpeaker 2: So whatever you're getting, don't reject it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just hold on because even if you want, if I was to replace them, we don't even have\n\nSpeaker 2: them anymore since, just keep them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But run it side by side with what you got.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need more of them, there's two things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call me at 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name's KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the second thing is when you go to scoreblue.com, John, there's a category.\n\nSpeaker 1: You log in with your AOL, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I adjusted it to 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way in the future, should you want more, you click that button and we'll send\n\nSpeaker 2: a refill or you call me.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only caveat is because it's a prescription, legally we can't, in the state of Texas, we\n\nSpeaker 2: can't send you more than one in a 30-day period or 20 pills and more than or no less\n\nSpeaker 1: than 20 pills in a one-year period.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: You already got 20, more than 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just click that button or call me.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we do have something stronger if you do need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we have several different EDs.\n\nSpeaker 1: But take what you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're great stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Run a side-by-side and call me when things go, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll be here for you, right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for verifying that, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take care, John.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, adios.",
