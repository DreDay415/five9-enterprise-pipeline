    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hi, my name is David Door. I got a prescription from you guys. I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you provide me the phone number associated with the prescription, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Five seven three three three seven eight six six six.\n\nSpeaker 2: And lastly, just your date of birth, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: 12358.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. All right, so the prescription here I see is for the 100 milligram Viagra written on December 14th by the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it looks like the doctor wrote it with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey David, so not sure if you saw some initial notes from the doctor. You're not required or obligated to get this monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is not a subscription. It's your prescription with refills that you can adjust to your needs if you would like.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you wanted, I could simply just put an extended pause on this and then that would allow you to call in and place\n\nSpeaker 2: orders for refills as needed. It looks like you have about\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 refills here left on the script.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I just canceled. I haven't taken anything to begin with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha, and I got 20 pills. So I got enough to last a little while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Well, upon cancellation, it would close out the prescription altogether.\n\nSpeaker 2: What that means you might see some price increases in the future should you want to order again.\n\nSpeaker 1: There would be a significant delay in getting approved again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just like the first time, just because you have to do the health survey and then have a doctor write you a new script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey David, I went ahead and did that for you and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
