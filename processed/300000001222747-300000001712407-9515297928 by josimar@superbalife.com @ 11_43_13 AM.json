    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, how you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing well, sir. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good. Um, yeah, I just got in and I received my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: The thing is, though, is it's short by about ten.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could take a look to see what's going on. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Last name is Martinez, M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z. Zip code is 9-2-5-0-5.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, give me a moment here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how many pills did you receive?\n\nSpeaker 1: I only got 30 in the container. I was supposed to get 40.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, give me a moment here to see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Um, I see here there wasn't really too many notes left on here,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I do see they had sent you a new order out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't really validate anything on my side,\n\nSpeaker 2: so at this point we're just going to kind of go with in good faith that you're saying you got 30.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm just going to notify the pharmacy to ship out an additional ten.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Now, I got another question for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: This was only a one-time purchase, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is an order you placed that has to come with a set date to remain active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Without that, you wouldn't be able to order in the future,\n\nSpeaker 2: or this order wouldn't be able to ship out.\n\nSpeaker 1: It needs to have the prescriptions because they're through Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: They need to have a refill date to stay active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Without the refill dates, the pharmacy can't ship anything out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that you spoke to someone on the 12th of January,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you had agreed upon setting it for five months out from now to freeze it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute. I agreed to what now?\n\nSpeaker 1: To just freeze out any future orders for five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you could try these out and see if you're a fan,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then call us back to finalize any choice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, okay. So my date is when did I have to call you? By what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Call us before July, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. And that way it won't be what I'm looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that way you don't have to be waiting for the packages to show up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just call us once you try them out, if you're a fan of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. We'll change your frequency to match your preference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You try to do the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said you're going to have them send them out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they'll send them out. You'll get a package with 10 in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you, sir. You have a good day now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
