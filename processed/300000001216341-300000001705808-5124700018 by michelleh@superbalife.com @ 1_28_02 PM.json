This is Harvey Micklin checking Austin, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just placed an order for the Viagra ATV, I think,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just wanted to verify that that was what I actually ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Hold on one second. I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Harvey, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: July 12, 1949.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I see you ordered a quantity of 25, 50 milligrams of the EGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was hoping that I ordered, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's not on a reorder or anything because I want to try these first\n\nSpeaker 1: and then see if I want to get on the regular schedule or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, so it does look like the doctor put you on refills every two months,\n\nSpeaker 1: which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause that for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps you locked in at your price point and just allows you\n\nSpeaker 2: and keeps your prescription active so you can just call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, I can pause that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'd rather just call in for a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not a problem. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll pause you until July 31, 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. You're all set, Harvey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
