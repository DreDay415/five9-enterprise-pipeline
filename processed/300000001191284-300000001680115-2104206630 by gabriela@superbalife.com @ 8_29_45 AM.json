    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Baselside.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. It's been a while. I ordered the suckers, you know, and I was in the marketplace prep and I saw you advertising this. I started reading on that sucker and it says guaranteed all your money back. And those suckers didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can accept my information. You have it there in your computer prep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, look, they don't work. And I bought the six bottles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ma'am? What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 78059.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ricardo Zavala.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ricardo Zavala.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Ricardo, so it looks like you placed this order back in June. So it's past the time that you have for you to return it. We only offer 90 days of payback guaranteed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I did call if they never answered, and I did send out several text messages if they never answered back, of course, and give them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you can, now that you're selling it, we'll tell them they're there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we are hoping Monday we'll be starting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye. Have a nice day.",
