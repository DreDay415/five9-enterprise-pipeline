    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Craig Smith.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Craig. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I just saw an expense on my account that I didn't approve. So I don't know why they're taking their money out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. I can look into this. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-9-53.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. And you're located at 412 Day Avenue, Bakersfield, California, 9-3-3-0-8?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. So that refill, which, yeah, I mean, if you don't want to receive regular ongoing refills with the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to. But the tricky one with that is usually if you call us same day,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can always immediately just get it canceled and refunded the next day sometimes.\n\nSpeaker 1: This was the 31st, so that was either Thursday or Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I couldn't get through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And it's actually the very end of their workday. It's 4.56 p.m. California time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm in California.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. The shipping team ended their day three hours ago. They shipped everything from the weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I don't remember renewing this. I don't remember renewing this for refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought it was a one-time, and then I would call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you can let me finish what I'm saying, I can actually be useful.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just don't speak over me, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I can message shipping, and if they haven't sent it out yet, I can –\n\nSpeaker 2: the first thing when I come in tomorrow morning is I can cancel and refund it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if it has gone out, which is unfortunately somewhat likely,\n\nSpeaker 2: I will just shoot you an email saying exactly what I'm about to say,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is just, hey, you're going to receive this by the end of the week\n\nSpeaker 2: or like Saturday or Monday at the very, very latest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you receive it, just don't open it. That's the most important part.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as you don't open it, you can write return to sender on the package,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can leave it in your mailbox, and your post person will bring it right back to us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we can refund you most easily.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, in regards to refills, it can definitely be confusing when you place an order online.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you place an order with one of us, I always like to be really thorough\n\nSpeaker 1: and explain how everything works over the phone, but when you order online,\n\nSpeaker 2: it does explain on the order page that all of their orders come with refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that if you don't want to receive them regularly, it says call this number.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says if you want to make any changes, you don't want to receive them regularly,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you want to cancel, call this number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it gives you the phone number to call us directly at this number right here right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: and because we didn't hear from you, that's why the prescription was refilled.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you don't want to receive those regular refills, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription will expire if we don't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to place an order before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've had some medical issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a pacemaker now, so I'm not okayed by my doctor yet to do any of that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I didn't know it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was in the hospital two weeks, almost died, so then I see this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and now I'm wondering why I'm getting charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it's not your fault.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just I didn't realize how often they renew.\n\nSpeaker 1: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because you did order the largest order, so I can understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, fingers crossed, because I did just message shipping,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the good news for you, the bad news for them is a lot of them do work over hours\n\nSpeaker 2: or keep a watchful eye even after they leave the office.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the first thing when I get here in the morning is I'll scroll up,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll be able to see if they were able to cancel this.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they were, you'll hear from me over e-mail regardless,\n\nSpeaker 2: but hopefully you'll hear from me over e-mail,\n\nSpeaker 1: hey, they caught this just in time or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I just refunded you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see that refund in the next few days, and if not, which is somewhat likely,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just say, hey, please write return to sender on this,\n\nSpeaker 1: and as long as you don't open it, your post person will bring it right back to us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll be able to use the exact same tracking number\n\nSpeaker 1: to see that it's being returned back to us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that will be enough that once we receive it we can refund to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have my e-mail address?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry about your medical issues, so I just canceled your script for you\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's pretty serious stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please cancel this if possible.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the e-mail we have on file is c, as in Craig, j, as in John,\n\nSpeaker 2: eldo at yahoo.com, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you can text me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, there is a supervisor that might be able to do that if I ask her in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's possible.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your name was?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia, that's my granddaughter's name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I love that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's a good name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you've been great.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Craig, and I'm so sorry about your health stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm getting better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so glad to hear it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it is good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, Craig.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll look forward to tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't mean to talk over you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you will hear from me tomorrow, and, yeah, I'm sorry for the confusion,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
