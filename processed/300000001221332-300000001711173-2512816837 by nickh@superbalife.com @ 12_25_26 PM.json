    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra Escort Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, I put in to cancel and I still been—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's being charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir, let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see what's going on, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Leroy Crenshaw, 7-11-1955.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Leroy, the last order I have right here was from December and that was for the 50—\n\nSpeaker 1: Milligram Viagra, quantity of eight.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's accurate, but I've been, you can try to, I canceled it in the beginning of—\n\nSpeaker 2: January.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I don't have anything on notes here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you give us a call to cancel it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I emailed you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so normally when you send an email, it will respond with an automatic email saying—\n\nSpeaker 1: That due to HIPAA rules that you have to call to confirm identity in order to make adjustments.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I don't see anything charged yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like your credit card company flagged it, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So nothing has been charged yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's good news to begin with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I want to talk about your prescription as a whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right now, you have a prescription dating back to 2022.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's some benefits to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What that means is you are a VIP member here at ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 1: You get a few perks with that per se.\n\nSpeaker 2: So right now, your perks right now is, meaning you have, this prescription is adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not required to get it monthly how you have for the last three years.\n\nSpeaker 2: What we could do is put this on an extended pause, and that would allow you to call in—\n\nSpeaker 1: And place orders as needed in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't need to get these every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: If, say, you want to refill three months from now, four months from now, you could give—\n\nSpeaker 2: Us a call, and then we could put that order through for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are the other perks?\n\nSpeaker 2: The other perks are, if you wanted, I could adjust your prescription to 100 milligrams—\n\nSpeaker 1: For the same cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, see, and that's the problem that's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, there's so much advertising out there that says you can get it for 98, 97 cents—\n\nSpeaker 2: Each, and I'm paying over $90 for one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we, I don't think that's us.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have any pills that are 97 cents each.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, a better, a price that I could get you is I could do 10 hundred milligrams for 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need less than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't do less than that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is the best deal on the market right now for the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then, put me on, I like that first option you had.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you want me to put it on a pause for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Put it on pause for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then you want me to adjust any future orders here?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can get you a better price for sure, I think.\n\nSpeaker 2: What kind of better price you going to give me?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, right now, you're paying for eight pills, 50 milligrams at 94.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can do 10 pills, 100 milligrams at $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, not right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go with the pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm saying I can do both for you, Leroy, so I can pause it and then make sure your—\n\nSpeaker 1: Next order, you know, next time you call in is cheaper.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't need to order today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to, you know, make sure we build the best program for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I like that 100 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can break them in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Leroy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and made those adjustments.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to give us a call next time you place an order, they know here that they—\n\nSpeaker 2: Should be putting forth 100 milligrams, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: At what price?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to be saving about 30 bucks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a big saving.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And two extra pills, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to make a note of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you got me down for the next to be on hold for six months, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you're all set, Leroy.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Outstanding.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
