I'm calling because you folks sold me a Viagra or something,\n\nSpeaker 1: and when I got it, it wasn't exactly what I was looking for,\n\nSpeaker 2: and now I want to cancel any additional orders that are coming from the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take a look into that for you. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: My last name is Parent, so P-A-R-E-N-T. The zip code is 03303.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. All right, you're all set on that part, so just keep in mind,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you decide to put an order in the future, unfortunately, you wouldn't be able to\n\nSpeaker 1: because the prescription is deleted. However, I went ahead and I stopped all orders for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the bottom line is you guys just sent me one item, and you sold me something totally different.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was a little disappointed with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you received the AG Visa. It's a white diamond-shaped pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not what I got.\n\nSpeaker 2: It should have been a white diamond-shaped pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm actually looking for it right now, so I'm just trying to identify what it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it wasn't the newest Viagra. It was supposed to be a new-style Viagra, A-G-V, whatever the hell I call it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I ordered that. That is not what I got.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's only a white diamond-shaped pill. That's the only thing you would see on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was hoping to get, but I was a little disappointed with the idea.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't get it, so I guess I was a little disappointed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Disappointing is an understatement, so definitely cancel my subscription. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries. You're all set, sir. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
