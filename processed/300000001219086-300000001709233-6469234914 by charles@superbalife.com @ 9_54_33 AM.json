My name is Alvin Williams.\n\nSpeaker 1: My date of birth is 12, 1954.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even for the call, I got a – even for my credit card company, there's two recurring charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. I see it. You got two.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And I didn't – I don't do recurring charges for anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only thing that I get recurring is for my car insurance because they require it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I pay it on my car.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is what I wanted to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: One was $63.95, and one was $54.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm pretty high tech.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get a stop delivery?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It won't allow me on either on the – or American Pharma or the –\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't stop it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want the power to stop anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: My initial reaction when I saw the charge, I wasn't going to go to the school card and dispute the charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was my first option.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I thought, okay, I see that you mailed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw something that has been mailed today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let that go through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I was thinking, well, I guess I can report my car as lost and change my car so when you charge next time,\n\nSpeaker 1: it'll get you one of those news.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm hoping that you went to a reputable company.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, some guys –\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some companies are not reputable.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm asking – I want it in my account for both accounts, and I'll do it at some future time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm getting these pills in the next couple of days that we delivered, the one with the $54.95 and the $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to actually reverse it since you didn't mail them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take delivery and I'll pay for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I'm not going to dispute the charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to go through that hassle of discovery.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll take a month, but anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what we're going to do is I'm going to ask you to push a button for each account to end my relationship with you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't want to be sold anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want the record mis-ended.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm hoping you got the reputable.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when I check this week, my account will be closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're good?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you do have two accounts.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do have two accounts.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I did is I just – brother, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just reversed this charge for the $54.95 because that was for the ducky one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm deactivating that account as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the only one that's going to be active is this one that's from All American Pharma, another one of our sister companies.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's for the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to go for the same medication, you notice that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So have you heard of Scor-Blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not selling you anything, but have you heard of Scor-Blue?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm a CEO.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been around the block.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know how to get my audience to upsell me that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tell the kids, stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stop.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I'm a scamp.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know you work for the company.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to push and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have ended the ducky MD charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ended both of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
