Let me pull up your account and read off your chart and I'll help you put a stop to this, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just correct me if I'm wrong as I pull this up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you're working with Dr. Moore Holcomb, my bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: And she wrote you, and just correct me, it says patient more than 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: She set you up as a VIP, FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra that we trademarked and we make in our Pfizer Labs of France FDA-approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I do see it's a 10 quantity, but she did order the, Dr. Holcomb is the one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll change the doctor now moving forward, but I'll make sure she doesn't do this because we'll change your doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dr. Holcomb has ordered the pharmacy to send you refills on a monthly basis on her behalf.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let me put you on a brief hold and I'll put a stop to that and I'll change your doctor so that doesn't happen again, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just hold your line, bud. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bet.",
