I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so yeah, let me pull up your account and see how the doctor wrote your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: To begin, can I just get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Emmett K. Steele, S-T-E-E-L-E, 8-12-48.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Steele, I see here the order was placed online\n\nSpeaker 2: and this was for a prescription of the 50 milligram Viagra AGV\n\nSpeaker 1: and this was written on December 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it was written December 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that does sound accurate, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Looking at the notes from the doctor who wrote it,\n\nSpeaker 1: it appears they wrote it with refills, so that's why that went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, Emmett, so the reason why this is the case is because\n\nSpeaker 1: they assume with the lower milligram dosages, patients are going to be taking two each sitting.\n\nSpeaker 2: They typically do this for patient convenience.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not the largest fan because sometimes patients are surprised by it.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is by no means a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are not required or obligated to get this monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is perfectly adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 1: You currently have about 10 more refills under this script,\n\nSpeaker 2: so if you wanted, you could simply pause the account\n\nSpeaker 1: and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to cancel, and what about the order for delivery\n\nSpeaker 1: that I got charged for that I didn't approve?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so canceling it closes it out altogether,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you will not have access to this medication any longer, okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: where pausing it allows you to have access to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: This most recent prescription shows that it's set to arrive today\n\nSpeaker 2: between 12.30 p.m. and 4.30 p.m., okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can keep that if you would like, or if you want, you can return it for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Return it and get refunded?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you would like, yeah, and that would close out the prescription, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want the prescription closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, it's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you just wanted to do that, you can simply return that for a refund\n\nSpeaker 1: and we can close out your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, but if I don't return it, it's still closed out, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you don't return it, you have two options.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can close it out altogether, all right,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that would close out the remaining 10 refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want that option. I want that option.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to close that altogether.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, now what I'm saying is, Mr. Steele, you could pause this\n\nSpeaker 1: where you will not receive these monthly,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So should you want a refill, say, 6 months from now,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can call in and you have access to this medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't want that. I want it closed out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what I'll do is I will go ahead and close this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Upon cancellation, this prescription is officially closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any future prescriptions will require a new health survey,\n\nSpeaker 1: consultation, and approval by doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you accept these terms?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, this account has officially been closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll no longer be able to order under this account, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I need any kind of reference number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you going to send me an email or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: You will get a confirmation email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.
