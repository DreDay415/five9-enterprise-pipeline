    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Tim Allen. I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let me pull up your account one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm already starting to see your VIP with us getting to Viagra. Do you mind if I ask why you're canceling?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I got about a two-year supply from what y'all sent me already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow. Yeah, I assume we sent you about 40 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you can order this as needed. You don't have to get it when you're not ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. So I need to cancel it so it won't be shipped to me automatically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I said is that you can order it as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, then how do I stop them? Yes, I'd like to stop the automatic shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, sir, I'm bringing this up so I can help you with that, not just to say it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what I'm going to do is how it works is for the next five months we will keep your prescription available\n\nSpeaker 2: and you will have to call us to receive your next order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: In that time frame, okay? And if you need more time, whatever the case is,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can leave it like this for the rest of your prescription, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, if you want, I can give you my name and extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can put your orders in and make sure your account stays like this also, you know, if you choose to.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, that is it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can you send me a confirmation or something, Quinn, saying that this has been taken off of automatic shipment?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no confirmation.\n\nSpeaker 1: The reason I'm asking is because I didn't last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've already called once and requested this, and then I got another shipment.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I need to make sure that it happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, I know what happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got my extension, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trust me.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to get anything else here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, for the next five months, everything is stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to have to call us in that time to receive the next order.\n\nSpeaker 1: And basically how I do it is when you do call me in the next few months here,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll push it out five months from the day you call,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll kind of just repeat that to let you keep doing it this way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got my extension and everything there, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can reassure you that nothing will go out until you call me there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
