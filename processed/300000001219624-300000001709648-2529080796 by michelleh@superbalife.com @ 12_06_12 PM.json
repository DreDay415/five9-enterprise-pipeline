I received it on January the 1st, and the very first part of December is when I contacted ScoreBlue to delay my package because of a stockpile, and it should have been delayed up until June, but then a month later is when I received another package that they also took $113.95 out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hold on one second, I'm going to transfer you to that agent. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.",
