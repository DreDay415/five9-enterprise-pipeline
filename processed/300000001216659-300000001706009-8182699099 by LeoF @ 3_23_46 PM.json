    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name's John Cantor. I initially placed an order for the new Viagra AGV or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got delivered Cialis. I called you guys and said, hey, I've tried Cialis, that's not what I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted the Viagra AGV. And the guy said, oh, I'm sorry, I'll ship it out immediately.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's been over 10 days. And I'm just wondering, is there such a thing as Viagra AGV or is it just Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it definitely is not Cialis. That's crazy, actually, that you got Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: If anything, you would think it'd be just our other version of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: But don't worry, Mr. Cantor, that was on the 16th, so it's been a week.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's moving slower than it should be, but the USPS does have a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're saying that's going to be at your place by the 26th. It's in Arizona now.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Monday. Yeah, it'll be there Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just taking a little longer than I expected. Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your courtesy. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, sir. Thank you for the call.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, have a nice weekend. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You as well. Thank you.",
