I have jeepadilla77 at Comcast.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: What would be the new one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's supposed to be jspadia, spadia, not padia, at Comcast.net.\n\nSpeaker 2: jspadia77 at Comcast.net.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, spadia, so s-p-a-d-e-a 77 at Comcast.com?\n\nSpeaker 2: Dot net.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dot net, okay. Yeah, that's what I have.

I want confirmation of my purchase, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or do you just wait for the script from the doctor? All right, appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fantastic. You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, have a good day.",
