    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at SCOREblue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm getting billed for a subscription, and I don't need a subscription here,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm unable to get into my profile and cancel this subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I must have a card on file. You guys keep sending me SCOREblue stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, sir, these prescriptions have adjustable frequencies,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I can see how yours is set up, and we can absolutely get this resolved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you provide me your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Keith Olsen, O-L-S-E-N, 22264.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how it's set up, but if we can check that out, it'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I see this prescription was originally written in October 2025,\n\nSpeaker 1: and this was for the 50-milligram Viagra, sildenafil generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: How much is that a month?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, right now, what you are paying for 15 pills is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how often do I get that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Your schedule currently is based on monthly, but this is perfectly adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is not a subscription, so if you wanted to adjust it, we can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some patients do bimonthly. Some patients do every 3 months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some patients prefer to just put a pause on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that allows them to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just had an order shipped, and that would be 15 pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it appears that that will probably be here later this week,\n\nSpeaker 1: pending the weather circumstance right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's right. It wasn't shipped there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was tracking it, but it's still en route.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm trying some of the Rougette, but it's kind of like a gummy.\n\nSpeaker 1: It makes my tongue go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And the Rougette Comparative Ease.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we are certified through Pfizer and an FDA-approved company,\n\nSpeaker 2: so everything that we sell here is FDA-approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Rougette, I know a lot of men are trying it,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you have to be very careful just because they are not FDA-approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: I respect the idea that you're wanting to try it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and obviously you're welcome to do so if you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could just pause your account here,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then should you want to return and have access to the remaining refills under the script,\n\nSpeaker 1: you could always just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll keep the one that's coming.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember trying it, though, so I'll keep.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've already gotten an order before, or is this my first order?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir. You've already received an order of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: What does it say on the side? Duckies?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. It would say Score Blue, and it would say Viagra on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. And they're 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could also adjust your prescription at the same price to 100 milligrams in the future as well,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you wanted something a little higher.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the same amount of pills doubled the price, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, I would honor your price for 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I might next time do that. I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll try one of the 50s and see how it works, and then maybe do the 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Just pause it for now because, like you were saying, the FDA approved means a lot to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Rougette has, like, three things in it, they say, you know, the sildenafil, Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then some other thing that's supposed to do your brain or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'm trying to – let me see if I have the login information for Score.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do have it. I don't know my – my username is incumbent. I don't know who has saved it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what I can do for you is I'll go ahead and pause it for you on my end,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I can email you a password reset, and then that would help you log in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't even know my username unless I use my email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Your username would be KeithOlson111 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, do you think I should keep you on the line until I get the login?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no. It's very straightforward, but let me go ahead and adjust your account here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I'm trying to look in my contacts where I keep some passwords.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me look in my drive folder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I probably have it in my drive folder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So, I'm going to send you a password reset email.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should see that in your inbox now, okay? From there, you'll be able to log in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I don't have that password saved for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, yeah. You'll be able to reset it. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can reset it with what I sent you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will, and then I'll go ahead and save everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see the email.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you're going to pause for now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. It's paused.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll put in my calendar the renewal.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll put in a date there after I get this shipment and review it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'll put a note in my calendar to possibly reactivate.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Happy to help, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
