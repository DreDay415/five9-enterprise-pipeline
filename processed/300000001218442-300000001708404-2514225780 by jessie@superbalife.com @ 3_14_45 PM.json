    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and\n\nSpeaker 2: last name? This is Gary Crigler, C-R-I-G-L-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment, Mr. Crigler. Okay. And can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Three, six, five, six, seven.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. My system's a little slow, Mr. Crigler.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment. Here we go. You're at 20813 County Road 68 in Robertsville, Alabama?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct. And you wanted to turn off your refills. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I didn't ever really expect it to come. Now it's sent me four bottles of this stuff. You know, every so often it\n\nSpeaker 1: shows up. So I want to be sure this is canceled, not charged to me anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Let me go ahead and turn that off for you so that way you're not getting charged. But you do want\n\nSpeaker 1: to keep your prescription active so when you are ready, you know, you can still have access.\n\nSpeaker 2: to your refills. You know, so you won't get anything else. You won't get charged anything\n\nSpeaker 1: else. We'll just pause it for, you know, at six months for you. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no way I'm going to use up this many pills in six months. I'll tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That is a lot. Well,\n\nSpeaker 2: let's, because, yeah, if you can't see your prescription altogether, you won't be able\n\nSpeaker 1: to, even if you wanted to, a year from now. You know what I mean? So in six months, you'll\n\nSpeaker 2: get a notification. Just let us know, like, hey, I'm not ready yet. And then we'll push\n\nSpeaker 1: it down the line for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. How often are they sending these things?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, originally it was every two months. But now we're just going to shift it to, like, literally six\n\nSpeaker 2: months. So if at six months you're not ready, we'll push it down the line for you again.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that keeps your prescription. Do I have to call? Or are you going to, what do I have\n\nSpeaker 2: to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, nothing. You just, um, we'll try to call this. You'll get an email. And I can\n\nSpeaker 2: say in the email, no, I don't want it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want it. Just push it down again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I tell you what, I'd like to just cancel it now. I know I'm not going to want it in\n\nSpeaker 1: six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no problem. All right. So once I cancel this, you won't be able to\n\nSpeaker 2: re-up it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
