    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Justice Monteith.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Justice, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm fine. Thank you. I am very displeased with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what's going on? Just want you to know for the record, I'm a federal officer. I ordered this thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: One.\n\nSpeaker 1: One prescription because I saw it on the internet and I tried it. I only ordered one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why are they sending me another refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because you guys have my credit card number and are getting ready to take this money out for something that I did not order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can look into this for you. What is the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Six three one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Three five three two six five three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: And.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1966.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, and you're located at 1575 Bright Shore Boulevard, Bayshore, New York.\n\nSpeaker 1: 11706.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is a refill that you received a few days ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your prescription on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: For up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself. Okay, okay, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I did not ask for a refill. It was a one-time order.\n\nSpeaker 1: One time, didn't ask for nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys take it upon yourself to send me a refill. I did not. I was trying already have the Viagra from Friday and.\n\nSpeaker 1: And in him, this was something they saying that that's on Viagra that works on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Steroids, you know, for 14 hours and I was trying it and that's what I ordered one. No refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: No one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Registered me for all this on my credit card because I'm gonna call my bank and tell my bank.\n\nSpeaker 1: That you guys is running a scam.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I did not order this pill. It just came today.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is why I'm calling you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did not order this at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: And give you the authorization or sign up for refill or nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ordered thing one time. I paid your money for the first time. Where's all this thing coming from?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Justice. There's a lot of yelling going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can walk you through all of this. I'm not in the business of.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm correcting people to the degree that I would be able to just because it's going to bring.\n\nSpeaker 1: Agitation.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you actually did when you placed the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sign up for refills because every order with us comes with refills and it's part of our terms of service and there is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are sent to you and it literally says.\n\nSpeaker 1: All of our orders come with refills. If you need to change or update them in any way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call this number and it offers you the phone number directly to us and.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I didn't hear from you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be why, but it does actually look like you did speak with somebody back in August and.\n\nSpeaker 1: That person.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did want to keep the prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the prescription was placed on hold for you for the full duration of six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which is the max of what we're able to do just because six months is when the prescription expires if we do not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Refill it and you agreed to that. So that is why you received that refill on February 8th.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much, how much you guys are charging me for this thing?\n\nSpeaker 1: The exact same price that you initially paid. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. How much is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're interrupting me. I'm trying to help you and answer the question you asked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you interested in the answer to the question that you asked?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. It's a hundred and thirteen dollars and ninety-five cents.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to stop this on my credit card. I'm going to call my bank and tell them to stop payment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm happy to cancel the prescription for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you do want to return the product for a refund, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is an option for you and I can email you the instructions for how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: The email we have on file for you is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Radcliffe e.\n\nSpeaker 2: Monty, it's spelled m-o-n-t-e-i-t-h at yahoo.com. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, the instructions are really thorough in the email and you should receive it in the next like two to three minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just follow those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once we receive the product back.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll refund you and you do have like a hundred and twenty days.\n\nSpeaker 1: From the order of the product to do that. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and absolutely do not send me nothing else. I don't want no prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's totally fine. I already did that. All right, Justice, will keep your eye out for that email I'm about to send to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yeah, just send it back to us and we're happy to refund you and the last part of my job is to let you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Know that if you were to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Dispute with us you would be blacklisted from ordering with the company moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't care. I'm going to call my bank and tell them to stop payment. I don't care. I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm getting ready to do that now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can blacklist me now. I'm not going to order from you ever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well if you ever want to try the AGV we are the only sellers of that product in the entire world so.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have a competitor but.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just keep this in mind, you know where to find us and.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've informed you of the rules of the road and I'll make a note of that in your customer service file.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so you send in the email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and it's really thorough. So yeah, you just do that and then of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll give you your money back once you return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Justice. So I just sent that email. Keep your eye out for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your script is canceled and I hope you have a great day.",
