    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Paul Agar, Quinn speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I need to see about, I did, when I signed, or tried to get a prescription from you guys,\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it, the first one, and I didn't realize that I was signing up for a subscription for\n\nSpeaker 2: it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to cancel that subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, there's no subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can choose to get this when you want, so you don't have to get it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I got it automatically.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it the next month, so, there was no way to change anything and no way to even\n\nSpeaker 2: cancel or stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can choose to get as needed or you can set up the days and the months that it comes\n\nSpeaker 1: out.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't choose either one of those options when you first buy it, then it will come out\n\nSpeaker 1: the way the doctor writes a prescription, it seems like that's what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can change it for you now, if you'd like to just order it as needed going forward\n\nSpeaker 1: or you can tell them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I didn't see anything to be able to do that of how it just kind of went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you can delay it a month on your site, but, you know, but any kind of major changes\n\nSpeaker 1: to the prescription, we do have to do on this end because we have to contact the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can just change that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So basically, we're not going to bullish on you or anything for the next five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to have to call us in that time to receive your next orders, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, could I just cancel the whole thing though at this point?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just rather just cancel it then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not kind of what I thought it would be of what it was kind of advertised for to be\n\nSpeaker 2: to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I already did it through another company, so I don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought it would be, it was supposed to be a faster acting and all that kind of stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: something different.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: It isn't compared to my other Viagra that I take from HIMSS.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I didn't get the response that I thought it would be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well HIMSS is, they sell very dangerous medications.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the reason why you may get a reaction like that from HIMSS, I mean, because we were\n\nSpeaker 1: the only FDA approved Viagra that we have here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you didn't get the AGV, then that's nothing but simply we can reship that out\n\nSpeaker 1: to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But HIMSS puts very dangerous stuff in their medications, and that's why it's going to\n\nSpeaker 1: give you that such strong reaction.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's also why they're not federally approved and not FDA approved by the government is\n\nSpeaker 1: because of the compounding they do with their medications.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you do have to be very careful.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yes, that stuff will give you an erection, but it will ultimately, it might, it's going\n\nSpeaker 2: to damage you down the line, a couple months down the line, it may stop anything from ever\n\nSpeaker 1: working for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I say this from experience, there's some customers that call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was the opposite.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was opposite effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yours didn't do anything, and the HIMSS did work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why I'm saying it's the opposite.\n\nSpeaker 1: That type of stuff is so dangerous that it will end up affecting your body, that the\n\nSpeaker 2: actual safe medications don't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're seeing...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I got the AGV, but there's no reason to continue trying yours, though, if it didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why I'm kind of, it doesn't really matter what I'm getting from it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do have the actual AGV that we can send you, because it looks like I'm not sure exactly\n\nSpeaker 2: what you got here.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, I mean, it's up to you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just trying to tell you that HIMSS is...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to...\n\nSpeaker 2: It won't hurt you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I...\n\nSpeaker 2: We already canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was just trying to give you some advice for your health, because I know personally,\n\nSpeaker 1: I have, I know personally that HIMSS really does have very dangerous practices.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sell medications with Tadalafil and Sidenafil, which is Viagra and Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: No doctor will ever tell you to take those both at the same time, because it can literally\n\nSpeaker 2: kill you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I guarantee you, I will put a thousand, all the money in the world on you can call\n\nSpeaker 2: HIMSS, and they put both of those medications in their pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it is dangerous, and it can kill you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yes, it can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I don't...\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't put...\n\nSpeaker 1: It gives you a hard on, and I get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But is it worth dying over it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't take those.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't take a mixture.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't take a mixture at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wouldn't deal with any company...\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: ...that would sell anything that would kill someone, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: You get what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, you might not take those ones, but they have very dangerous practices, and if you\n\nSpeaker 2: don't believe me...\n\nSpeaker 1: And I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yours didn't work, so it's, like, yours...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: You already canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not...\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't take those, but they do have dangerous medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to check it out, go to this website called bluepillsecrets.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it was done by Chris Henson, the guy from old NRC, How to Catch a Predator.\n\nSpeaker 2: He actually has done a very extensive investigative report on a lot of those companies that sell\n\nSpeaker 1: that type of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would check it out if I was you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.",
