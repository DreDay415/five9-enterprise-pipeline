    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Olivia. My name is John List. My name is Tuosto, T-U-O-S-T-O.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, John. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good, thank you. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got a text message that my order has shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't order anything, so I'm not sure what got shipped, but I know for sure I didn't order anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What is your date of birth, John?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-13-5-0.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you're located at 201 Leach Court, Bayville, New Jersey, 08721?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so yeah, there was an order, and it has already shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if you do want to return it, of course you certainly can for a refund,\n\nSpeaker 1: and because you haven't received it yet, you are in a good position where that means you haven't opened it yet,\n\nSpeaker 2: and because you haven't opened it yet, you can just write return to sender on the package,\n\nSpeaker 1: and as long as it isn't opened, they'll just bring it right back to us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we can return it once we receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can you tell me how this happens, though? I mean, I didn't order anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: so how does this get executed, and can you tell me what was shipped?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the only way this would have happened is that a new consult would have started while –\n\nSpeaker 2: so what it says is that today the new consultation was started while changing the order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it says John T., and you are John T.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so what I did was I sent in an inquiry saying how could I change the order\n\nSpeaker 1: from what I received the last time to the new Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the next thing I know is no response to that, and I get a shipped response.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what was shipped? Was AGV shipped, or was a renewal of what I got in the past?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's the branded Viagra, and it's four pills of the branded Viagra at 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is neither the AGV nor – it's definitely not what you used to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the OG blue pill through Pfizer, and it's four pills of the Viagra 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's the cost of that?\n\nSpeaker 2: $410.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is such bullshit. I mean, you've got to be able to stop the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm refusing to charge for the credit card. I did not order that. You have no authorization on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So somebody needs to stop that shipment. I'm 75 years old.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to go through this return and everything else. This is such a scam.\n\nSpeaker 1: So please, stop the shipment. Do not charge my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you did place this order, and there already is a tracking number,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I'm happy to share with you, or I can just e-mail it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't place an order. All I did was ask about –\n\nSpeaker 1: You just communicated to me that you did place an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I did not. I just said –\n\nSpeaker 1: You're talking.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just said I asked a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I am able to speak, let me know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So our computer system also keeps record.\n\nSpeaker 2: We actually have a tech guy where a big part of his job is he literally watches,\n\nSpeaker 1: like can see you through your phone going through and selecting the different options on the website\n\nSpeaker 2: when you place the order. Ordering with us is a really extensive process.\n\nSpeaker 1: So anytime banks reach out to us, we always have extensive evidence to show that you did,\n\nSpeaker 2: in fact, order what you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I do understand that the branded Viagra pills are very expensive.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are very expensive from Pfizer. They are very expensive from us who sell Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that is a fact, and there is nowhere you can go to get them cheaper.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, the AGB is a much better deal, and it is a very good product.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I am sorry that I don't have any notes about you emailing us to change the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am sorry if that didn't get changed in time, which it sounds like was the issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do really apologize about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But yes, I mean you did place the order because there is a note that says,\n\nSpeaker 1: new consult started while changing order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't care. Okay, you finished speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you finished speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: You reached out to us to ask to change the order that you did place.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: You certainly do not have to go to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: You certainly do not have to do any big process.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just the minute you receive it in a few days,\n\nSpeaker 2: you just have to write return to sender on the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as long as you don't open it, it will come right back to us\n\nSpeaker 2: and we can refund you immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that is our protocol when somebody places an order and the order has been shipped\n\nSpeaker 2: is we are super happy to refund you any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you are not happy with the order, we just have to receive it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be happy to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But cancel my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want nothing to do with this company because what you've said is all crap.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't order anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I simply asked a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I change my previous prescription to the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything else that was detected by this person is incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never got a price.\n\nSpeaker 1: I never got anything other than a text message that says your order has shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: So please delete my account and I'll take care of this through social media\n\nSpeaker 1: and everything else and I'll return the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you'll never get paid because American Express will never pay this bill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is my job to let you know that if you did file a dispute with us,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do get blacklisted from ever ordering with the company.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's their big boss's very special rule.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the best thing you can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: That she's very strict about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've informed you and I will leave a note in your profile that you're aware.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you inactivate my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want anybody else dealing with this ever again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, John.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good luck.",
