    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey. Hello. My name is Freddy. I have a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh. What's your question, Freddy?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I didn't, when I placed my first order, I didn't know this is automatic refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I already got my second refill, but I never asked for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, and then I never used it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh. Okay. And what is your date of birth, Freddy?\n\nSpeaker 2: January 1st, 1984.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you for confirming that information, Freddy.\n\nSpeaker 2: And yes, so you do have a prescription with us for Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that prescription from the doctor does come with a monthly interval,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you are getting a quantity of 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is enough supply for every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you do receive it every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you feel like every two months is too soon of a frequency,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can always go ahead and adjust that to your preference,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we can adjust it to every three months or every four months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Typically, customers are not that active,\n\nSpeaker 1: usually like to have a frequency of every four months when it comes to a quantity of 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but the thing is, like, my first bottle, I never even touched it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I got my second one already, but I don't need that anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what I can go ahead and do for you is that we can adjust the frequency\n\nSpeaker 1: to every four months going on, and then I will also pause your date for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no. I want to cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need that anymore, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because we can always pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the reason why, Freddy, is because I don't know if you are aware,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we are the only company in the U.S. who sells FDA-approved Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: and who have the contract exclusively with Pfizer for the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to continue ordering real Viagra later on in the future,\n\nSpeaker 1: then I suggest you just to pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's typically what customers tend to do, especially if you have enough supply at this point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's true.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can always reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, you're also going to pause, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but for right now, yes, I just want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the future, yes, of course, if I need it, I will order.\n\nSpeaker 2: But right now, I want to cancel, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, if you want to reorder in the future, then I suggest you to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need any supply, you can always give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: But for right now, we'll pause so that you're able to reorder in the future with us, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're all set, Freddy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Likewise.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye.",
