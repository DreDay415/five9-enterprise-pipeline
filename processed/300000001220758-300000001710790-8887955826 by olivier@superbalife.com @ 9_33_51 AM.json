    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Vagra. Hello, the reason I'm calling is I ordered some of your samples, it's supposed\n\nSpeaker 2: to be the new Vagra, AGV, but then you send me the sedanol, which does nothing for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: May I have the phone number linked to the prescription so I can look up and help you with\n\nSpeaker 2: that? Which phone number? The one that you used to open the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: You mean my number? Yeah, did you put a phone number to place your order, right? When you\n\nSpeaker 2: went online or you call over the phone, it was a phone number. What is the phone number that you\n\nSpeaker 1: used? Yeah, 651-278-4360. Mr. Young? Yes. Okay, you say you got the wrong medicine. Do you have\n\nSpeaker 2: it in front of you by chance? Yeah, I got the bottle here. Yeah, can you open it and tell me\n\nSpeaker 1: the engravement in the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Say it again. Can you open it and tell me what you see engraved on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Engraved on what? Yeah, the number, the code, the code on the actual pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: the white pill. What is the code on the pill? Oh, you mean looking at the medication?\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill, the actual pill. Pick up one of the pills in a bottle and let me know which numbers\n\nSpeaker 2: showing on the pill. There is a code on each pill. What is that number\n\nSpeaker 1: from the one that you have in your bottle? Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 333-AC339 or something. No, that's not, that's not. So you should receive the,\n\nSpeaker 1: you should say 50. That's regular sedenafil. I mean, sedenafil is the ingredient for any form\n\nSpeaker 2: of Viagra. I want you to be aware of that. But the AGV, they improved the formula, the way they\n\nSpeaker 1: designed the formula. Now, let me ask you that question. It's your first, no, you say it's not\n\nSpeaker 2: your first time taking Viagra. And did you take Cialis in the past? Was Cialis more effective or\n\nSpeaker 1: you more of a Viagra guy? No, this will be the first time I try it, but my ED is completely gone\n\nSpeaker 2: for the last three or four years. Three, four years. Okay. So what we can do,\n\nSpeaker 1: there is a couple of scenarios, Mr. Young. Let me, let me tell you. So I can replace that one\n\nSpeaker 2: with the AGV, which is five. The pill going to say five zero is a diamond shaped white pill. It's a\n\nSpeaker 1: five zero on the pill. It's an improved formula. It's better than anything else they made before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, the other option that I'm going to bring to your attention is that if, if you feel like you\n\nSpeaker 1: still have resistance, what we can do, we have also Cialis. So the way Cialis work,\n\nSpeaker 2: it works with the prostate as well. Right. And then you can take Cialis when you want to perform\n\nSpeaker 1: like the Viagra, that sort of Viagra work, but you can also take Cialis on a daily. So if you\n\nSpeaker 2: have resistance still with that, you could order Cialis, but a daily Cialis, five milligrams. So\n\nSpeaker 1: what it's going to do, maybe because you say it's been a long time that you, you have your ED now,\n\nSpeaker 2: like you say, three, four years, maybe you're going to need like a little bit of a treatment\n\nSpeaker 1: for a couple months where you take it. You take an ED medicine, a micro dose for, for a few months\n\nSpeaker 2: daily. So we can build up in your system to kind of, uh, kind of fix because it's been a long time\n\nSpeaker 1: from what you're saying, right? Maybe as you go taking a, like a pill when you want to perform\n\nSpeaker 2: might not be activated right away. Now, when you're going to be done with the daily, now the body is\n\nSpeaker 1: kind of, you know, build up with the med as far as, you know, ED med. Now you probably can go back\n\nSpeaker 2: to the one that you take when you need to perform. I don't know if you see what I'm trying to explain.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, not really. So, so, yeah. So what I'm explaining is you have two major ED med. Uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: you have Viagra and you have Cialis. You have Viagra and you have Cialis. Now both work\n\nSpeaker 1: differently in the body. So usually for men, it's one or the others for some reason. If Viagra don't\n\nSpeaker 2: If Viagra don't work for you, Cialis will work better for you. If Cialis don't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra will work better. It's one of those things. So now the only difference is Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's only when you want to perform, you know, there was different dosage, 15 milligram,\n\nSpeaker 1: a hundred milligram. Now Cialis is different. Cialis have the option when you want to perform,\n\nSpeaker 2: but also Cialis also have the option of daily. That means you take it every day as a lower\n\nSpeaker 1: dosage and then it stay in your system. It builds up because you know, some people have a slow\n\nSpeaker 2: system. You got to kind of get used to. So sometimes you may, you might take some things\n\nSpeaker 1: when you want to perform. It might not work right away because you need to micro dose the medicine\n\nSpeaker 2: for a while. So your body going to be filled up with the med. So to the point that when you want\n\nSpeaker 1: to have erection, it come by itself, you know, so Viagra and Cialis have a different way of\n\nSpeaker 2: proceeding. So what I was trying to explain is that I can send you the replacement to try for\n\nSpeaker 1: the, with the AGV. And then if you still have resistance, I would advise to get on a daily Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So over time it's going to be like a micro dose, micro dose, micro dose, micro dose. So it\n\nSpeaker 1: can load you up after a few months. Now, maybe you can switch with the Cialis that you take when\n\nSpeaker 2: you want to perform. It can, and maybe you're going to activate because if you have been dealing with\n\nSpeaker 1: a problem for a while, I would say it's a slow, slow process to get back to it. To be honest,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, it's not, you know, it's not overnight. You probably need something to stay in your system,\n\nSpeaker 1: keep triggering the body to do the proper blood flow. So it's going to be like a little bit of\n\nSpeaker 2: a treatment, basically. You see what I'm saying? How long, approximately how long that would be?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be up to you. You're going to observe your body. There is no specific scenario\n\nSpeaker 2: based on the severity of your situation. Maybe it depends. You can try it. Oh, one month I'm good,\n\nSpeaker 1: or maybe two months or maybe three months. I don't know. It's going to be you to take your\n\nSpeaker 2: med and observe closely. All the things work for you or you react, but you know, you might need a\n\nSpeaker 1: little bit of patience sometimes because sometimes people give up on ED because they're impatient.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, they want overnight results, this and that, but you know, patience is key on a lot of\n\nSpeaker 1: stuff. You know what I mean? To resolve issues is really important, you know? So that's the option\n\nSpeaker 2: we have. So I can replace what you order by the AGV if you want to try the AGV and see if that\n\nSpeaker 1: works for you. But if you still have resistance, because we don't know if you're a Viagra guy,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're a Cialis guy, we don't know. We got to try to figure it out, right? So I can replace that,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if that don't work, I would advise you to call us back and reorder daily Cialis for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you're going to take that. Can I call? Yeah, go ahead. Do I have to call or can I go\n\nSpeaker 1: online and order Cialis? Yeah, you can, but I would say call us. Call us so, you know, we make sure\n\nSpeaker 2: that, you know, the order is properly placed and we can make an adjustment for you. Or if you\n\nSpeaker 1: replace the order, call us after, you know, just to make sure. But I can send you the replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can try. It's going to be a different call on appeal. Now, if you feel like this is still not\n\nSpeaker 1: good, we have another option for you, which would be the daily Cialis for now. And then if Cialis\n\nSpeaker 2: gives you a better reaction, you can get in the future the Cialis as you go. Meaning is the Cialis\n\nSpeaker 1: that you take is 20 milligrams. That's the maximum dosage for Cialis you take when you want\n\nSpeaker 2: to perform, you know. So that just, I'm trying to give you some positive scenario to kind of,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, help a little bit based on what you told me, you know. Okay. So that's what I think.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why don't you do that? Send me the replacement and then I will, you know, if it's not good enough,\n\nSpeaker 1: then I'll call you back and go on the other route with Cialis. Okay. So I'm sending you\n\nSpeaker 2: the replacement. You're not getting charged because you paid for your order already.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I did pay for the AGB. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a replacement. So they're going to send\n\nSpeaker 2: that to you and then give us a call and then we can make, we can try to get you some different,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay. If you want, you can call me. My extension is 0019 and we can try to pivot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Pivot Ollie 0019 and we can try to pivot and see if that can be a better help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Okay. You're welcome. So I'll send the replacement right now. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.",
