    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Troy Bell. I'm sending you an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to tell you, I don't need no more sent to me with a generic bag.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's your zip code, Troy?\n\nSpeaker 1: 36862.\n\nSpeaker 2: One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're on Drake Avenue?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So if I cancel this out, sir, you wouldn't be able to order it again down the road?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want me to do that, or do you want me to put a hold on it so you can get it again later?\n\nSpeaker 1: I get a prescription from my doctor, so I shouldn't be odd, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just a regular generic bag. I'm getting it right. It ain't the new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're getting the new one. But if you don't want it, I can stop it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you've been getting the new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: They said the hour before, it helps it work quicker than an hour, ain't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, for some people it does. It depends on how it reacts to your body.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have to take it and see. The bottle is not going to tell you exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: The bottle says an hour. I know the bottle says an hour, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm telling you, you have to take the pill and see how it works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everybody's body is different, and how the medicine reacts to you is going to be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just trying to see what's on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your pill itself would just have 100 stamped on it. That would be the indicator.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm putting it on hold, and I can hold it when I want, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can. I can hold it until July for you. That gives you about six months full.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll put it on hold for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to pay anything today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you all going to take out any money and take out something or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no. Everything is paused until July 31st, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing will be billed. You just can call in before then and order when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if I don't call in, I won't hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, if you don't call in by the 31st, yes, another order will ship out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know about the 31st. You said August.\n\nSpeaker 1: The 31st of July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: The 31st of July.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I've gotten it all taken care of. You will not be billed, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, sir. Bye-bye.",
