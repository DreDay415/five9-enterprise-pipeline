What's your last name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name is Peterson, P-E-T-E-R-S-E-N, zip code 98110.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I pulled up your profile here. I see, let's confirm here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so right now it looks like you have a refill date of every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been postponed out, and you have an order that was shipped out on the 6th.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like it could be a replacement order for your original one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Other than that, let me see here, open transit, but it got stuck due to some weather delays,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that will be a little bit delayed.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what alerted my concern, so the original transaction that I did for when I started this account\n\nSpeaker 1: was I ordered a 25 prescription of the new Viagra ATV or whatever it is,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then while I was doing the purchase, it threw an offer at me for 25 more pills, paid 59 more dollars,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I opted for that, but I got 50 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: It turns out they were the wrong ones, so then we did the replacement order last week,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then looking at my account, it looks like we only shipped these 40 pills, not 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's going to show up as that, because it's not going to show up as 50,\n\nSpeaker 1: but through the system it was sent out as a replacement for the original order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it should be 50 there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the other thing that caught my attention is on my account under your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: there's like a click refill tab, and that now says quantity 40 for $149, where before it said quantity 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's just based off the one that they suggested it to for you, to the 40 count,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's what they needed to do on that end.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, once that order gets delivered, it will update itself to the 113 for 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect then, so no concerns.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're all set on that part.\n\nSpeaker 1: If any questions come up, let us know, but I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, man, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
