    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. I keep getting shipments and charges that I didn't really intend to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to make sure that gets canceled and you don't get any more charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sure. Yeah. Let's take a look at your prescription and see how it's organized.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you please provide me with your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's Michael Wilson, April 1, 1953.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Mr. Wilson, I see your address as 3720 Blue Sky Drive. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the prescription looks like it was written on September 19.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this was for the 50-milligram Viagra, a quantity of 25 each fulfillment. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Looking at the notes from the doctor here, it shows it was written with refills bimonthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So this was done because of the low milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes the doctors will do this for convenience, but it's not necessarily required.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you wanted, this is not a subscription. This is a prescription with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you could pause it, and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see here you have nine refills left under the script.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want those accessible to you, I usually recommend doing a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. As long as that won't automatically restart?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. So this would not be on a monthly or bimonthly refill schedule.\n\nSpeaker 1: This would be paused up to six months, so I can pause it all the way to August 1st for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to refill before that date, you could just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to push it back at any time, you can do that as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, that'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I went ahead and made those adjustments, and you're all set?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Happy to help. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
