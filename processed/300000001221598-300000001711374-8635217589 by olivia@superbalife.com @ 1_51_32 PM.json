Hi, Thomas. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Fine, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. How can I help you today, Thomas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I'm on an automatic, I guess, refill list or whatever. They just send it to me automatically.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't want to cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. Yeah, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, are you located... What's your date of birth? Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: 7-14-1955. I had the RX number to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's okay. And are you located at 578 Stonegate Drive, Russellville, Arkansas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular ongoing refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you did want to order before then you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but then at least you'd be able to keep access to the prescription itself, the doctor's approval, and the price point.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you wouldn't receive those regular orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah. All right, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you need anything before the end of July, July 28th, just give us a call Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here. And otherwise, your prescription is on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you, Thomas. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
