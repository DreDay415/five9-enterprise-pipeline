I'm going to read off\n\nSpeaker 1: your chart. Just help me verify a couple things so I can help you put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 2: this. All right, Bill? Okay, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, of course. So when I read this, I\n\nSpeaker 1: do see that you were working with Dr. Shamil Tariq. He's one of our Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 2: doctors and it looks like he set you up with a VIP status and he wrote a script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just correct me if I'm wrong. It says 50 milligrams of Viagra, Pfizer Viagra, the\n\nSpeaker 2: white diamond pill that we make in our Pfizer-Levinson-Francis, the FDA-approved\n\nSpeaker 1: one. And I do see that the doctor Tariq has ordered the pharmacy to send you\n\nSpeaker 2: refills on a monthly basis. That's a lot of pills. You want me to put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 1: that so you don't get them on a monthly anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, man. I don't need them on a monthly basis. Well, not only that. If you were John Holmes and I was Ron\n\nSpeaker 1: Jeremy and we did a menage a tout, we won't be able to run through all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's porn star status. So that's the whole issue. I was like, why am I\n\nSpeaker 1: continuing to get these things? I haven't even used what I've had.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, for this damn doctor, you know what I'll even do? I'll fire this guy and if you need a\n\nSpeaker 1: new one, let me know. But let me put a stop to this and then you can just get\n\nSpeaker 2: it on your own, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yes, please. Thank you.",
