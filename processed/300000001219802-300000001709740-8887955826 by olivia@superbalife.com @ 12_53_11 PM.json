    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Pleasure is all mine, but my name is Dimitri Chagradosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Dimitri, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing good. How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Dimitri?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and I missed your name. It was kind of a phone issue. What was your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia, now I can remember. Olivia, so take a look what happens. I placed an order from advertising from my phone, AGV, as you call it, yes? Blue pill. But I received a white one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I received a white one. The tablets are not blue as I saw. And it's not AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: AVG. It's not AGV, am I right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would love to look into this for you. What is the phone number associated with your prescription for me to go find?\n\nSpeaker 2: 818-445-0738. 0738.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. There you are, Dimitri. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and okay. So yeah, you were ordering with us back last fall. Okay. And you got a white pill and it wasn't the AGV, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm so sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so are you interested in ordering the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm interested to try AGV. Because what I received when I came back to the country,\n\nSpeaker 1: I see it's not AGV. Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So what are we going to do about it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so what I can do is I can place an order. I can send you a sample of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But that would put you back on a prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: with us. And every prescription with us does come with refills. So I could place the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: on hold for you for up to six months while you try it out, make sure you love it, etc.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's the furthest out I could do and that's the best I could do. So yeah, I could\n\nSpeaker 2: send you 10 pills on us of the AGV since that is what you were expecting with your previous\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription. And you know, you were approved. It's just then that would start this new prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: that I could place on hold for you for a while, but it would mean that you have a prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: with us. Whereas you close out the other one, it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's do this. So I got your offer and I will tell you this. How much is your tryout pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, free. So I would send them to you. We would pay for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: The thing is, I don't want to be on a monthly billings, on the monthly fillings. I just\n\nSpeaker 1: need it once. That's why I'm asking how much it might cost without me being on a monthly\n\nSpeaker 2: bill, all the stuff, you know, just once.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't have to receive monthly refills if you don't want to with the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we also do not place one-time orders where you don't select at least one refill date\n\nSpeaker 1: in the next six months. So I don't know if that makes sense, but what I'm saying is,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you don't want like regular ongoing orders like every month, two months, three months,\n\nSpeaker 1: four months, you don't have to have those. But if you do want to have a prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: with us, you have to have at least one refill saved every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't have a one-time order option. So how it would work is I would send you the\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 pills AGV on us. We would pay for them. And then I could place the prescription on\n\nSpeaker 1: hold for you until July, but that means you either need to order it by then or let us\n\nSpeaker 2: know if it didn't work out or it will be refilled then.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it. Let's do this. Sounds fair.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, what did you say? Yeah, I can't hear you very well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see. I thought we cut off. I said sounds fair. It's a fair deal. Let's do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. So yeah, I'll send you these. So this is going to be 50 milligrams because\n\nSpeaker 1: that's what you were previously approved for. It's going to be 10 pills of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I send it to 1880 Idlewood Road in Glendale, California, 91202?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I will do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. And I'll make sure it's at\n\nSpeaker 1: the free price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So yeah, these should be out to you within the next week. There\n\nSpeaker 1: is a snowstorm, but typically you would get them by next week at the latest. Maybe it'll\n\nSpeaker 2: be up to next Wednesday. Who knows?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and if you need anything before July 1st,\n\nSpeaker 2: just give us a call. We're always here December Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dimitri. I hope you love these.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no. Olivia, Olivia, Olivia, I will share one more thing with you. Maybe\n\nSpeaker 1: you will check it with the company guys or officials. Take a look. On the paperwork that\n\nSpeaker 2: came with the bottle, it says take one per day. On the can, where the tablet is, on the\n\nSpeaker 1: tablet can, it says take one to two tablets by mouth one hour before sex as needed. Do\n\nSpeaker 2: not take more than two tablets in 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So basically those white ones, it says to take one to two, like two tablets at once?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because you got 50 milligrams, it is\n\nSpeaker 1: safe to take up to 100 milligrams at one time. So if I were you, I would definitely\n\nSpeaker 2: start with just one of the 50 milligrams, but then if they didn't work for you, you\n\nSpeaker 1: could take two at a time. And I do want to let you know that the AGV, the ones I just\n\nSpeaker 2: sent you, those pills are still white pills, but they are a different product than what\n\nSpeaker 1: you were previously receiving. So they are going to be white pills, but they are the\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV. And the way you will know is the pills themselves on them, they're going to say five\n\nSpeaker 1: zero for 50, like the milligrams. And the side of the bottle should say AGV and it should\n\nSpeaker 2: say Greenstone because that's the manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see. Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm. Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. All right. Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dimitri. I hope you enjoy this. Oh, and the\n\nSpeaker 2: last note is please make sure to take these on an empty stomach. That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you want to avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them just because caffeine\n\nSpeaker 2: and alcohol restricts blood flow. It's not that significant of a safety issue or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just if you want the most out of them, you will avoid alcohol and caffeine the day\n\nSpeaker 2: you take them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Olivia, one more time. One more thing. For example, I know you know\n\nSpeaker 2: more than me about how the pill works. It's just what I should kind of like, for example,\n\nSpeaker 1: should I take it one hour before everything starts, 15 minutes before? So how long it\n\nSpeaker 2: takes to kick in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So I would take them 30 minutes to an hour before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Aha. Okay. Empty stomach or like, for example, if it's happening, like usually it's close to the evening, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So an empty stomach, so say you have dinner ideally at like 6:30 or 7, you\n\nSpeaker 2: just don't want to, A, you don't want to get too full probably, and then B, you probably\n\nSpeaker 1: don't want to take them until like, you know, 8, 8:30, something like that at the earliest.\n\nSpeaker 2: 8:30 in the evening, you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, like give it at least an hour and a half to two hours after you eat. And ideally, you don't want to have like a huge meal, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Got it. Got it. Understood. So thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you so much, Dimitri. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thanks a lot, Aliza.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
