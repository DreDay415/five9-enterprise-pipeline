    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mark, and the last name is Grandstaff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Mark. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Mark?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I had ordered Scor-Blue and they sent me a generic Viagra, which doesn't work. And they were supposed to give me some heavier dosage of the new Super Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I can definitely help you with this. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mark, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 3-30-55.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. And you're located at 861 South Seastall Road, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84105?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Yeah. So I do see you here. Okay. And you're saying you didn't receive the HEV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that right? That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. So I will reship out to you on us, since you already paid for it, the HEV.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll make sure it's definitely the right product. The way you're going to know it's the right product is the pills themselves on them are going to say 1-0-0 for 100, like the milligrams. There's still going to be a white pill, but the side of the bottle is going to say HEV and it's also going to say Greenstone because that's the manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then most importantly, the pills themselves are going to say 1-0-0 on them for 100. Now, can I ship this replacement to 861 South Seastall Road, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84105?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. So you should receive these pending, you know, that crazy storm right now, but usually you would receive these, you know, by probably Thursday, but probably by Thursday through Saturday, maybe winter storm Monday or Tuesday at the very latest.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And if you need anything, in the meantime, we're always here. This phone number, Monday through Friday, 8-5 Pacific. I hope you enjoy these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just a reminder, Mark, always make sure to take these on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you want to avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them, just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much, and\n\nSpeaker 1: I am really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Have a great day, Mark. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.",
