    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I want to see if I accidentally just placed an order, and I want to see if I can cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I want to see if I can cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Let me see what's going on, if I have the information up.\n\nSpeaker 1: So something happened? I let you place it, and you just want to cancel it? What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I did. I accidentally – I was trying to cancel, but it didn't automatically reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just wanted to cancel the automatic reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when I was trying to do that, I accidentally just placed another order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you. I see. So I do see the order that is at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were getting the 50 milligrams of Viagra. You're getting 10 of them every month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So the one – obviously, you don't want to try to get the one that's at the pharmacy today,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm going to go ahead and cancel that for you and issue a refund for that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And I do see that you did have the every-month prescription with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's it working for you? Have you tried them, or what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why do you want to cancel, if you don't mind?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just don't need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You know, to keep your prescription, if you like, you don't have to get them every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can pause it or put a hold on it for five or six months, give you a chance to get caught up to use them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Therefore, they're not coming to you every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you do want to order in the future, if you do, basically, you won't be – you keep your discount price,\n\nSpeaker 2: because our pills come from the labs in Pfizer, France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And basically, that's going to go up drastically once the tariff starts to come in.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you already have a prescription on file, you won't get hit with the –\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to be like two or three times more without a prescription on file to just order stand-alone orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I just put it on hold, like just an indefinite hold?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can push it out for like five or six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, just cancel it for me, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Like I said, if we cancel it, that means you wouldn't be on a prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you did try to order on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that means chances that you probably couldn't get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you did, it's going to be like three times more than what you're paying now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'm good with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No, I'm good with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I just wanted to take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
