    "text": "Speaker 1: And thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir, my name is George Brown from Henniker, New Hampshire, and I'd like to cancel my prescription and subscription, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem, George. Could you just confirm your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: January 24, 1955.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So I see the prescription was for the 50 milligram Viagra AGV, quantity of 10 each fulfillment. Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it does.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it looks like the doctor wrote it with refills. Now, George, you're not required or obligated to get this monthly if you don't want. You are able to simply pause it, and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed for all the remaining refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's okay. I'll just go ahead and cancel if I could, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so upon cancellation, the prescription is officially closed out. Any future prescriptions would require a new health consultation by a doctor, survey, and approval process, which can take 24 to 48 hours. Do you accept those terms?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, went ahead and took care of that for you. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
