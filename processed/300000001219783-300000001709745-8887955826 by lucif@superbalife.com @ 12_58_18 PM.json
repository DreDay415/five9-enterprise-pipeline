How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I wish to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 49094.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tim Carpenter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty, and do you mind if I ask why it is you're canceling the Viagra today, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I was only supposed to be trying it, and it wasn't supposed to be a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, all you got to do is set this up, sir. I mean, it's obviously a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean, I know that, but it was supposed to be just a one-time order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, as long as you set that up, sir, that's fine. You can set it up to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's an option. We give those options when you purchase this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, that's what I did, and it's not working. I just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you don't want to just order it as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's because it's not working?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've already got a prescription through my doctor for that stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: and this stuff that I'm getting from you guys is not what was advertised.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what was advertised? What did you think you were getting, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Dude, I just want to cancel the prescription, all right, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Look, I'm trying to help you out, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want your help. I just want your help in canceling it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sir. Have a good day. We'll cancel it for you. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.",
