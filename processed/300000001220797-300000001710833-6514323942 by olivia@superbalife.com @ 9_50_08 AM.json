    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Alan Placid calling. What I'm calling about, ma'am, is on the new pill that's out, the AGB, I believe, or whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, my question is this. Are there any stimulants in that pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not that I know of.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I ordered some. I ordered some. I'm sure it will be in the next few days. But will it have on the bottle what the ingredients are?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me... So I have the ingredients. Let me go find them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I give them to you, will you know what it is?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think I will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: There we go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it's obviously sildenafil citrate is going to be the primary active ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, dibasic anhydrous...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: ...cross carmelosodium, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, triacetin, SDNC blue number two, and then aluminum oxide.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Is there any way, if I gave you my email, you could email that to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. Have you ever placed an order with us?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, sure. I'm waiting for one to come right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. Yeah, I can pull up your email then. Give me one second. Then I can just copy-paste it over.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, Alan. Is your email adqsub at gmail.com?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is exactly right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Amazing. Okay. I'll send that to you right now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what was your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia, thanks a lot for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Alan. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.",
