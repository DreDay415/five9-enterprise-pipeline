How about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just calling, I got something to announce today I wasn't expecting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to give me your phone number so I can look up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: 419-944-4785.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that 419-944?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 4785.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, it's not pulling up. What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 43612.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was the first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Terrence. Terrence, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it looks like that was one of your refills that went out there, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like I've been a VIP with this here for a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it looks like that was just one of your refills that went out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, well how do I go about canceling that?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, would you rather just order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it looks like you've been with us here for a long time, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you can simply just order this when you're ready if you prefer that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just want to cancel altogether because I haven't had any of that for two months or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, yes, we can cancel it and I totally understand your predicament.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, just so you don't have to lose this account, like I said, you have been with us for a long time here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, we can just not bill you or ship you anything for even like six months and give you some time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it came in. My wife found them and she's against it and she's flipping out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I need it all because I don't want her to see it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, copy, copy, copy that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need the account to disappear. I don't want her to see it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, we'll do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want to send it to your buddy's house or anything like that, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, your wife won't see them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I wasn't expecting, I wasn't even expecting any, what's that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead of saying you got a good friend or something, we'll send it over there to his house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, I just don't want her to see, like she was trying, like she was at home and she opened up my mail, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, copy that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know it was coming and she's like on your website, like asking for my password and shit, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I understand loud and clear.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, man, we'll take care of it for you, but if you like, you can always give us another address or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, like I said, I haven't had her for two months, but also I wasn't expecting it either, and it was like a surprise.\n\nSpeaker 1: She just called me freaking out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't want her to go into the account, because I can see her, because she's seeing it was my phone number as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: She obviously knows my email address, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but legally we can't have anybody else adjust anything on the account if it's not the actual patient.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but she could go in there and she could put my email address and my phone number, but I guess it would come back to my phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yeah, but we wouldn't be able to change anything or alter any information or anything like that, because she's not the patient.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, even if she did do that, she still wouldn't be able to change anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I forgot about that, but just to be safe, I mean, if I have to come back, I will, but just to be safe, if I could just cancel it and get rid of the account in general.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a way you can just make it disappear?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can do it for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate that, because I wasn't expecting anything, but then again, I haven't had it for a couple months, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries, it's all canceled out for you, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so if I were to go on there, it wouldn't let me log in or anything like that, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you shouldn't be able to find it, it should just deactivate it, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, thanks.",
