    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Diego.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello Diego.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing, sir? All right. I just got another—\n\nSpeaker 2: Order of—\n\nSpeaker 1: Sedona Phil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Today, and I got an order about a month ago, so I'd rather you didn't ship me any more—\n\nSpeaker 1: Medications until I call and ask for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm on there. Mr. William Barr, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. Yeah, I want to tell the pharmacy to stop the initial writing that I see here, which is 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that being said, you're just gonna call to reorder as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're gonna pause you, I think, up to half a year, and you can call, and if you just maintain to refill a year—\n\nSpeaker 2: You're always gonna get the price that you're getting right now. Only thing is we're gonna stop the monthly. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just stop the monthly for now. I'll call you when I need more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna pause your prescription just to lock your price in as well, so you don't pay a higher price when you reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do I pay for?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95, so there's six bucks a piece, huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean the more you get is a little better. Usually you can get 25 pills, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You save a little more, but you know, it's based on the monthly budget that you can allow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well I stopped the monthly right now, so you'd be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my girl and I are in our 70s. We don't—we're not that busy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, three times a week?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, two to three. Yeah, that's pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, for considering our age it is, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It wouldn't be good if we were in our 20s, but oh—\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow, but it's just seven days during the week. So that's at least half of the week. That's not bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't automatically send them to me because I don't—I don't consume them that fast.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, everything will be paused for half a year, so you can reorder a monthly stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.",
