    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm just calling to make sure that my order went through because when they took the money out of my card,\n\nSpeaker 1: it said something about verifying my identity. I had to take a selfie and a picture of my driver's license and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just wanted to make sure everything was correct on your end.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what was your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: First name is Travis, last name is P as in Peter, I as in I, C as in Cat, O as in Oscar, U as in Unicorn.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your date of birth and address, Mr. Travis?\n\nSpeaker 2: My date of birth is 7-28-1978.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so my new address is 2618 Millburn Boulevard in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my billing address is different, so I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't a mix-up with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what's the address on the ID there?\n\nSpeaker 2: The ID is actually an old address. It's not the billing address. It was the address that I lived prior to the billing address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you go ahead and confirm that for me, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 12 DuPont, Alpaca, New Jersey.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what triggered it. It's because your ID and the address was different than your shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: But since you're on the phone with me, I can confirm all this for you. That's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll see this order start to process normally now, Travis.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll ship out. It's not going to ship out today because they're having a winter storm where we ship from.\n\nSpeaker 1: But tomorrow they said they'll be back on. I've seen you guys over in your area getting pumped on.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it should be there by the end of the week. You should see that order show up.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get a tracking number and a confirmation email as well, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I should get the actual order sometime at the end of this week?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're moving a little slow with USPS because of all the winter storms in the southeast and the north and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they said they're going to be running as normal by tomorrow, so you should be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see that by the end of the week. You'll get a tracking number to your email.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's USPS, like your regular postal mail. I'll bring that by.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good. Now, this is a money-back guarantee type of thing because I've never tried this before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you haven't tried it, I'm sure you'll get great results.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't, yeah, call us back, and then you can get your money back if you send it back or whatever. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sounds good, but you've never had that issue, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Some people. I mean, it doesn't work for every single guy, but you don't seem too old.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said you've never tried it before, so I'm sure you'll get some really good results.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. We'll see. So everything is good on your end as far as the shipping and all that stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. Now you're just waiting. The doctor's going to look at this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like we said, you're not like an older guy, not an unhealthy person,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you shouldn't see any problem getting the order approved and then sent out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good. Okay. I appreciate it. You've been great. Thank you for your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Thank you for yours. You enjoy the rest of your day, sir. Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.",
