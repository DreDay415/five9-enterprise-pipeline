This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Walter Moses. M-O-S-E-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Walter. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my subscription to the generic Viagra that I've been receiving.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay, Walter. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: August the 5th, 1947.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. And you're located at 5849 South Meadowwood Avenue, Springfield, Missouri?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wonderful. Yeah, so I do see you here. All right. Well, so I'm assuming the Viagra didn't work for you. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, something else has worked better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Okay. Well, just so you know, it is my job to let you know that if you did want to try our newest, highest quality products,\n\nSpeaker 2: we are sending out a free sample of 10 pills of our highest quality, newest stuff from our Pfizer labs in France to folks who haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: My favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and the headache,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that it comes with kind of like a five-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the way it would work is I would send you out 10 free pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and those free pills would start a prescription that would be placed on hold for you until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: While you try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, and we believe that you'd give us a call in two to five months to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we might be able to keep you, and that would make it worth it to us, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if not, you know, you just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, we're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it is a great product if you did want to try it and compare\n\nSpeaker 1: and contrast it with whatever else you are currently doing that is working for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: With those 10 free ones you're talking about, would it be similar to what I just got in that after the trial of 10,\n\nSpeaker 2: there would just be an automatic shipment each month, or are these just a trial without having to have the monthly prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: So the trial, like I mentioned, would go until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the prescription would be placed on hold until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, let's say you love the pills, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You love the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to run out by May, probably.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to give us a call in May.\n\nSpeaker 1: You say, hey, I want to order these.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we say, hey, okay, we can price match your old price.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you say, great, I want to order these, but I don't want monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we say, okay, you can do bi-monthly refills, tri-monthly, quadruple monthly.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can place it on hold for you for six months, and then you can call when you want to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you choose one of those tons of options.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if the pills didn't work for you, you'd know pretty quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd give us a call within these next few months or at any point before June, and you'd just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it would be one of those two.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in other words, I wouldn't have a monthly charge during that time?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, certainly not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send these out to you at 50 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship these to 5849 South Meadowood Avenue, Springfield, Missouri, 65810?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So usually I'd say, because you're in Missouri, that they'll be to you by Thursday or Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, this winter storm is crazy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to say Friday, Saturday, or Monday, or Tuesday at the very latest maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you need anything before June, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then very important, I'm sure you already know this, but just in case you don't, it's a good reminder to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to make sure to take the pills on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you also want to avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because caffeine and alcohol more so, but they both restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you so much, Walter.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you love these, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so just to clarify, I'm not going to get further charged for the Viagra, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I sent you a free sample, and then the prescription is on hold until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
