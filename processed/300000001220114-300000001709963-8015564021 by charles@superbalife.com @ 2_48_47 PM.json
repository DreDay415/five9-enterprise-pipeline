    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. About a month ago, I ordered some Cidentical from you guys,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you sent me a box and charged me for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But since then, I've gotten two more packages.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I don't remember ordering.\n\nSpeaker 2: One of them had a product called Testosterone Gene.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you gave me two bottles of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. It does look like it was ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if you placed it on your own or it was thrown in there by the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a testosterone booster. Have you been taking them at all?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I bite testosterone. I think it's in pretty darn good shape.\n\nSpeaker 2: I go to the gym two times a week, and I'm not having any problems there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Hey, if you want to shoot them back over to us, we'll give you the refund for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. And then you just don't need the pills as often as every single month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, I did a little experiment on myself to see if it would make much difference,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it didn't. I didn't realize it was going to come once a month or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right. We understand if you don't necessarily need it once a month,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can pause everything for like four or five months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it doesn't come monthly anymore. It'll be on a schedule, if you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if that's something that you need, I can set that up for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: To tell you the truth, sir, I don't need this medication. I just was curious.\n\nSpeaker 2: Years ago, I tried it a couple times, and I thought, well, that was a little bit of a difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just an old soldier, and I'm an old Special Forces guy.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've stayed in pretty good shape, and I think that's paid off.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'd like to return these and stop any future shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. There's a Southgate, Kentucky address on the pill bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Shoot it back, everything that you don't want, back over to them,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we will issue the refund for everything, and that'll be it. Nothing will ever come again.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. I see Beverly Hills. Is that...?\n\nSpeaker 2: Beverly Hills? No. So on the Viagra pill bottle?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, actually, yeah. Send it back to the Beverly Hills. I'm sorry. Yeah, do that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've got one, two, three bottles of this testosterone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the Viagra you're going to send back to Southgate, Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the testogene you're going to send back to Beverly Hills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So where do I find the address for Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 2: On the Viagra pill bottle that you've been getting.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just looking for that address, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is... You ready for it? I'll just give it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, here, let me...\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is 525...\n\nSpeaker 2: 525...\n\nSpeaker 1: Alexandria Pike, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-R-I-A, and then Pike, P-I-K-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that is in Southgate, Kentucky. Southgate is one word.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the zip code is 41071.\n\nSpeaker 2: One more time, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: 41071.\n\nSpeaker 2: 41071.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you, sir. I appreciate the information. I'll get this back in the mail to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you for your service, by the way. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was young and bulletproof and lucky enough to come back with ten kickers and ten toes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hell, yeah. Amen, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for that.",
