    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Mark.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for holding on and use my telephone number and you can always call me if you need\n\nSpeaker 1: anything in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be your guy.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you don't get passed around.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see you were working with Jessie early on.\n\nSpeaker 1: She took care of you, but because I got my fingerprints on this and as a veteran, I always\n\nSpeaker 2: take pride and honor in my work, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you have a pen, my extension is 00370.\n\nSpeaker 2: 00370.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00370.\n\nSpeaker 2: 00370 and my name is K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: So next time you call, you don't get passed around, wait in the queue, you just cut through\n\nSpeaker 2: everything and come straight for me, but don't ever leave a voicemail because I might be\n\nSpeaker 1: on the other call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just tell one of my colleagues to take down your number, Mark, and I'll definitely call\n\nSpeaker 1: you back within that hour or that day, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll share with you what I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll share with you what I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to pause it because it sounds like your gears were grinded, but I went ahead\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll make it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments and I overrode\n\nSpeaker 1: the system and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I reversed this charge\n\nSpeaker 2: and I put a stop to what that refill was trying to be put out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get a chance, I paused your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get a chance, go into scoreblue.com and you log in with your Gmail, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: The M-D-L-H-I 48 at Gmail.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you log in there, there's a category called receipts.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see the negative 6395.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you use a PayPal or credit card or something like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: At that time, it was a credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it'll come back immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: If not, within an hour, 24 hours, but just rest assured that I went ahead and I handled\n\nSpeaker 2: it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are an American company, but you're definitely not calling China or Venezuela or the Philippines,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Homebred, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: So just rest assured.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the...\n\nSpeaker 1: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm listening.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the order that I just received, that payment just came up, that's been canceled now?\n\nSpeaker 1: I canceled it and I reversed the charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what I did for the future is when you go to scoreblue.com, Mark, there's a category\n\nSpeaker 2: when you log in with your Gmail that says your prescriptions, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Under receipts.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go there on your own time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way, you have full autonomy on when you want it and how you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't mean you're going to get it once anymore because legally, we're only authorized\n\nSpeaker 1: to give one refill per year with a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, sir, I doubt I'll be using it ever again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't think that's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said you were a veteran?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: I too.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm a veteran.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am too a veteran.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the veteran gave me that prescription for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I don't, you know, sir, you're talking about the AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been doing this a long time and I say this respectfully from brother to brother\n\nSpeaker 2: as veterans.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you take out that pill from the VA, because I know what you're talking about, it's going\n\nSpeaker 2: to say AC-339 or AC-340.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you take out our pill, it's going to say the bottle's going to look the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you look on what we sent you, just look at it, it says 50, and try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see the difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I don't, I texted you guys back and said it didn't do anything that they said.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was not happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't do anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if that's the case, because we're, this is an American company, Pfizer is an American\n\nSpeaker 1: over a hundred years, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm not saying this to get into a chess match with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: As a brother, the only other thing I've seen in over a thousand cases year in and year\n\nSpeaker 2: out is there's two things, because I have a prostate problem too, I'm in my fifties.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm younger than you, obviously, but with cases like yours, there's two things that\n\nSpeaker 2: we come across.\n\nSpeaker 1: If the AGV isn't working, because that's the best Viagra on the market, men do a lateral\n\nSpeaker 2: move to Cialis daily, which it cooks and brews in the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now if they don't want to take it on a monthly basis, what we do then is send you for free,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you're a patient of ours, a herbal organic activator to flush out all the calcium\n\nSpeaker 1: levels that have been building up in the spongy tissue that are preventing you from resulting\n\nSpeaker 2: in an erection.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the activator, and this is in my defense, I will tell you, clinically, based on the\n\nSpeaker 2: research we've been doing for all the last 50 years, is that, and I take the activator\n\nSpeaker 1: every 60 days, because I do Jiu-Jitsu, right, in my fifties, and I can't do matches longer\n\nSpeaker 2: than 10 minutes anymore, because I need to take a leak, I need a pee.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I take the activator, I can do matches up to 15, 20 minutes, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what happens is it does three things, it's very simple.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take two in the morning, two at night.\n\nSpeaker 2: It flushes it out, and it smooths the corpora in the carnarvosa, the two chambers, one's\n\nSpeaker 1: for semen, and one's for your urine.\n\nSpeaker 2: It flushes that out, and it smooths the muscles and makes it relax, so it shaves off the calcium\n\nSpeaker 1: levels that are preventing the arteries to dilate, and the third thing is it enhances\n\nSpeaker 2: the vasolidation, so you can have the erection in the spongy tissues, feeling that blood\n\nSpeaker 1: flow, instead of it going to your head or to your heart, right, because we're a little\n\nSpeaker 2: older and I have hypertension, it shoves it straight down.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll send you the activator for free, there's no obligation here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why Pfizer got involved in this is because the Viagra is the most successful, it's the\n\nSpeaker 1: miracle drug, but we need to be able to take care of the physiology.\n\nSpeaker 2: Had we known that the damn MREs would have messed up our gut health, like Coca-Cola and\n\nSpeaker 1: all these other things, we wouldn't have gut problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just be on the lookout, I'll send you that Erboactivator, and my extension is 0037, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Mr. Bateman, Sarge, I'll tell you, it really works, and it doesn't cost you anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's free for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when you take that, finish the bottle, finish the damn bottle to its entirety, and\n\nSpeaker 2: then pop the Viagra and watch, watch it take off, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So call me, yeah, because you've got to have faith in this, and I'll pray this over you,\n\nSpeaker 2: Mark 1124, therefore I say to you, my brethren, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe\n\nSpeaker 1: that you receive them and you will have them in Jesus' mighty name, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send that to you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then call me on 0037, I got you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, take care, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
