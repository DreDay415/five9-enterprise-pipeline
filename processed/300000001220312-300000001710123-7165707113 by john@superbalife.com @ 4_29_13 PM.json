    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. I'm trying to make a purchase with ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they asked me if I wanted to double it, and I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I have eight transactions. I made one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name for the code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles Stiglmayer, 14224.\n\nSpeaker 1: Clinton Street?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you double the order, it bills as two separate transactions, but you did double the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to cancel the doubling of the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what was the original, 59?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the upgrade is 59.40. The original charges are the 113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for 113, that was for 25 pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the price for the 25 with the pharmacy fee, and then all the other, like, tax or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the additional 25 was 59.40.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want the additional 25, I can still cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'll take it, but I only want them transactions to go through one time each.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have several different emails saying I made a transaction, and it looks like I made several transactions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, because you paid for 25 pills at 113.95, and when you accepted the extra 25 pills, that's a second transaction.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've only made two transactions with us, but it's all going to come in one pill bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I don't know if you understand. I got the...\n\nSpeaker 2: I do understand, sir. You're not listening to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you add the upgrade, it charges you in a separate transaction. It's not all on one transaction.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get that. I get that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I have an email for 113. My next email is for 113. My next email is for a dollar.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess that's a Google fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then it says I made an international transaction. There's another dollar.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I have one for 59.40.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not the credit card company, sir. Some of those aren't us. We charge you two times.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got off the phone with the credit card company. They told me to call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We charge you two times, sir. I don't know how many times I can tell you this.\n\nSpeaker 2: 113.95 and 59.40. We've charged you two times. I'm looking right at it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I just want to make sure that's all there is.\n\nSpeaker 2: I promise you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good one.",
