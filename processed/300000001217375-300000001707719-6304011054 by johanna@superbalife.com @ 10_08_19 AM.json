Because I actually went in there to stop you guys from taking another one, put another card number in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same card, but it's the old number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that matter?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: They'll still be able to put it back on the same card, even if you change the card number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once they're canceled, you're entirely canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: So no need to dispute it with your bank, because that does hurt our business when you report it as fraud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't want to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know about how long before the refund is issued?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's already been done on our end.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll take up to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
