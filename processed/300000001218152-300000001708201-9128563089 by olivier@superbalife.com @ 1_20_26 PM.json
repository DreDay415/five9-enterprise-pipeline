    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, doing good.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. Mr. Gary Gorvenstein?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm curious.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't realize I had signed up for a subscription, an ongoing,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I saw where my credit card was billed over to Friday, I think it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm expecting to get a package today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm curious, could I return that for a refund, or do I have to take that before I can cancel?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm not going to continue my service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, so basically what happened was, from what I can see,\n\nSpeaker 1: Dr. Dembaran wrote the prescription with 10 tablets every 30 days due to the low count\n\nSpeaker 2: of tablets you're getting, because there's 30 days during the month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Assuming that you're active, so he put it on the 30 days, but that's not something\n\nSpeaker 2: that you have a requirement to follow.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you call saying that, hey, you know, that's not really my schedule,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can have the pharmacy pausing the prescription for you, and you can order as needed instead.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just, you know, communication about your prescription, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to get it every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was just the initial, because most patients be calling, upset,\n\nSpeaker 2: oh, I need my Viagra, what is the delay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get 10, doctor assuming there is 30 days in a month, if you're active,\n\nSpeaker 2: unless you say you're not active, now they'll be, oh, okay, Mr. Grobenstein is not active,\n\nSpeaker 1: let's put a pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people be like, hey, you know, I got my 10 pill, pause me for 90 days,\n\nSpeaker 1: send me 10 in 90 days, you can pause up to half a year, you know, it's based on your need.\n\nSpeaker 2: There is no strong commitment or anything of that nature with ScoreBlue, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just communication, so you can pause, and when you pause, that lock your price in,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the issue is they finance a doctor consultation initially, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you need to have that open to reorder, because when you don't have that,\n\nSpeaker 2: when you reorder, the price is different, because they got to keep financing the doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: to evaluate your profile and legally send the Viagra, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you do, you pause the prescription, so you don't get regular refill\n\nSpeaker 1: or monthly refill, and you can get it once or twice a year to lock your price in, but, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: not on a daily or every 30 days, you know, if you don't have it, there is no point, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I cannot go to the pharmacy to pause your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that way you lock your price, consultation to access the Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: or any other Viagra is available, you just don't get refill or bill every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. So let me ask you this, I'm not, I just got out of work, so I'm not home yet,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I don't know if I received my package, it's scheduled to be delivered today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I return that for refund, or would I just?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I mean, if you like, you can try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can ask my manager if we can get you a discount, because it wasn't ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever works for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'd be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't expecting that charge this month, like I say, I'm, still got a few pills left.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not having to use them every time, but, you know, it's definitely a boost, but it's,\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wasn't expecting that charge this month, and it just kind of, just kind of see\n\nSpeaker 2: if I could, you know, either stop it, eliminate it, or whatever, but if I can return them,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then just get it on an as-needed basis, that'd be,\n\nSpeaker 2: that would be the best scenario for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I mean, I can, you, if you want, you can write refuse return on it, or like I say,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get you a discount for that, and then I'm going to post the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, that way, that post you have to have for a year, or you can reorder as-needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That'd be, that'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me advise the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Corbett, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so I advised the pharmacy to pause the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: They got the correspondence right now, and what would you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to return that, or you want me to get you a discount?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, what kind of discount?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me, let me ask.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm going to place you on a brief hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
