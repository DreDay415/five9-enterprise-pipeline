I need to make a change in my prescription or the, I guess, the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if I'm on, like, two or three months, but I need to prolong it a little longer because I'm getting too many.\n\nSpeaker 2: You need a little more time? No problem. What was your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Ryan Bradford.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Bradford. Yeah, it looks like it was every 90 days. I can double that, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Push the next order out. Six months for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's six months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and if you need more time, just call us back just like today, anytime before, like, mid-July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be fine. You have even, you know, push it even further if you want to keep it active. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, let's try six months for now, and if I need to, I'll do that, and I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Thank you, Mr. Bradford, so you're all set. If you need anything else, give us a shout.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do it. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
