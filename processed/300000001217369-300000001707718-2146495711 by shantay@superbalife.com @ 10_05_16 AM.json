    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. I ordered from ScoreBlue a new product, Viagra AGV, and that was my intention anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: I received just a regular Viagra in my order.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could have been me. I did it on the phone and shifting screens and that kind of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I may have done it myself. I don't know, but can you take a look at that order and see what we can do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. No problem. If I can have your name and your date of birth.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Donald Horn and my date of birth is 2-3-49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it looks like on my end how the order was sent over to the pharmacy was for our standard generic Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: but because you wanted the AGV, it won't be a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll have the pharmacy send you a free replacement order, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Now, how do we deal with the product that I have on hand?\n\nSpeaker 1: I took one pill, and because it's a pharmacy item, I would understand there's no returns.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're just going to ship me another?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you're going to get a free replacement order,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't have to worry about returning anything back or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can just dispose of what you received.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that's very fair, and it was probably my mistake.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, anyway, what do you need next for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I already put that replacement order in for you, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I was a little bit under a timeline, but my first order came pretty quickly via post office,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I would assume the same one would be coming at the same speed, same mode.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if anything, it will probably be quicker because we don't have to wait for a doctor's prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds great. Well, I'm a happy camper now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, amazing. Well, Mr. Horne, is there anything else I can assist you with?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's all I needed today, and I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely. Well, you enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
