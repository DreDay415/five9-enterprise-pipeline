    "text": "Speaker 1: Good morning. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I'm not sure if my credit card went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Something came up and it said, it gave me a choice of either it was a fraud or it wasn't a fraud,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I picked the green button, which I said was not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I wanted to make sure that the order went through. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: February 20, 1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Yes. I see your order went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor just approved your prescription, so now it's at the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they'll be shipping it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll email you a tracking number once it goes out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool, cool, cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and because it took me to one site, and it didn't allow me to go any further than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yep. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll be receiving three products?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. So the testosterone is going to come in a separate – that comes from our supplement warehouse,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you'll be receiving two packages.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I read one where you take two a day. That's the product you just mentioned?\n\nSpeaker 2: Testosterone, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Testosterone. And the other one is Viagra A, B, G, which – I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: As needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: As needed. Gotcha. And the other product, what does that do?\n\nSpeaker 2: The other product, I do not know because I don't – I'm not familiar with that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't sell that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know which one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the testosterone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you see three products or two products that I ordered?\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw you did – well, you did two, but you did an additional pill upgrade.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. That's what it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. So that's why there's three separate charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bought 10 for $63.95 – it's $49, and then the pharmacy charges a $14.95 processing fee,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you added an additional 10 pills for $29.40, and then you added on the testosterone green for $79.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So a total of how many pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: A quantity of 20 Viagras and 20 testosterone drains.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it says three bottles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay, so testosterone is – I saw a picture of three bottles, but I'm only getting one?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it says three bottles.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you take two per day? Is that how it works?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Honestly, I don't know because I'm not familiar with our supplement line.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can transfer you to somebody who is.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's fine, but you're answering most of my questions anyway. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I guess I'll be receiving them in a couple days or so?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll get them in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what about reordering? How does that work?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it does come with automatic refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: A quantity of 10 would put you on automatic refills on a monthly basis,\n\nSpeaker 2: but now that you have BIT status, you don't have to have them on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you could switch them to every two months, every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and put a six-month hold on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your prescription active, gives you time to try out the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: and also just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it also keeps you locked in at your price point just in case prices go up.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, I could pause that for you until August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, because I would say probably I'm active maybe twice a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So that would last me, well,\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you don't need a refill by August 1st, just call us and you can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it just keeps you locked in at your price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I still make it locked?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I just go ahead and move it even further back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I know how often I would need these pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The system only allows us to set it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it says to August 1st, which is a little over.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just give us a call before August 1st, and then we can push that back for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: How am I going to remember that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get a reminder or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to put, like, a little reminder in your phone on your calendar.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so like August, before August 1st, you said?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: At the same number I'm calling at?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they put it on hold for another six months if necessary, right, or three months or whatever?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because a prescription is only good for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if people call and place the order and they cancel, we cover the doctor's fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's like every time you cancel and then you come back for another order,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's like going to the doctor's for the first time, doing that for the patient.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the company doesn't like that because more money coming out of their pocket.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it just makes more sense just to pause it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way, you know, it just keeps your profile open and active with the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so call before August 1st is what you're asking me to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll write that down.\n\nSpeaker 2: And is there anything else I should know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I read some information about this product.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's supposed to be top of the line, good quality.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we are the only company that's FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're contracted with Pfizer's manufacturer in France called Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there anything else I hadn't asked maybe that I should know?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I think you got it covered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think the automatic refills is pretty much it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I had any other questions, like maybe reducing the amount, like if I broke the pill in half,\n\nSpeaker 2: would it work semi as efficiently?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you got 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you've never had any medication, I would definitely recommend start with 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can just break it in half and see if that gives you the results you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if not, take the other half.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can take up to 100 milligrams within 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you also want to make sure you take it on an empty stomach or just don't eat a heavy meal like a burger or a steak\n\nSpeaker 1: because that takes a while for the medication to break down slower in your body.\n\nSpeaker 2: What about after when I'm done with my business?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I had an experience a long time ago with another type of drug on the market\n\nSpeaker 2: that's actually the worst that I found out later after I read the information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which one was that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Which one was that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That was Friday's plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they have a bunch of bad crap in their pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I understood it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understood it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It caused some deaths and some other information.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it was like it lasted so long.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I know what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the AGB, you have to be aroused.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: A guy just told me on the phone yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: He goes, you know how you fix that problem?\n\nSpeaker 2: You put cold water on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was like, oh, my God.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had no idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: He told me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, he said cold water.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's like, people, you know, they go to the hospital and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's like, you don't have to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just put cold water on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, good to know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Something new every day.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, the AGB, you have to be aroused.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you have to be aroused?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: For it to kick in?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, like you're not going to walk around with a boner for like 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that would be a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's distracting for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You and everybody else, I'm sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much for the information, and I look forward to my package,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I appreciate your time and answers here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cool, cool, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
