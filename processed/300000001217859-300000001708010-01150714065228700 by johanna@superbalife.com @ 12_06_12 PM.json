    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Joanna speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi there, I'd like to cancel my account and get a refund, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir, I can see. What was the reason? Actually, can I get your phone number, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, hold on one second, let me just refresh my screen here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what's your phone number, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 406-522-8700.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you. I have your account here. I do see your VIP status, customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And currently, your account is set up to receive refills on a monthly basis, but we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You actually have the option to pause your account or set up your, or modify the frequency of your orders at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that you can maintain your prescription available with refills to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So did you want me to put a pause on your account until July?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like you to cancel the account, but the site also says I can get a refund if not satisfied.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that not correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, within a 90-day period. So were you not happy with the results you got from the Viagra 50 mg?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, not working for me. I wish it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and do you have it in front of you? I just want to make sure you got the new and improved AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have to dig it out. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I have the original order. What do you need from it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you read to me what it says on the actual label? I'm sorry, on the actual pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want the RX number?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'll need to know what it says on the actual tablet, if that's possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, look at the tablet itself?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see anything written on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I probably need a magnifying glass. I can't read it. I can read you the label.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because I just wanted to make sure you had gotten the new AGV, it looks like on my end.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the prescription bottle, does it say AGV after Silbenafil in parentheses?\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does not? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't say that, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I believe the pharmacy made an error. They sent you the previous generic and not the new and improved AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do apologize for that, sir, but don't worry, I'm going to send you a replacement order of 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would rather just cancel and get my money back, if that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you hadn't had a chance to try the AGV. The AGV actually is a game changer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's unfortunate that you weren't able to experience that for yourself, as we are in high demand and we are FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was going to send you a replacement order of 25 of them. You've gotten two orders of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I was going to send you an additional five just for the inconvenience.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you sent me the wrong ones to begin with, why would I not get a refund for those?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm offering to send you the replacement. That's what I was trying to discuss with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, did you want me to send that to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I would rather get a refund and cancel the account, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, once I do cancel your account, it will cancel your prescription and all available refills and will also cancel your VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 1: That most recent order you got, if you want to, just write return to sender on the package and send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once the pharmacy receives it back, they will issue you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what about a refund for the first set of pills that were incorrect?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you still have those?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you can send those back, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're saying if I send those back, the refund will automatically happen?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would say send them back. The pharmacy will notate it on your account, and then a refund will be issued.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can just call back to follow up if you want in a few days or, yeah, next week, likely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and do you have a number? I know you said your name is Joanne.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the same number you called in today. Any of our agents will be able to assist you with that. So just go ahead and return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then you are canceling the account then, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, thank you very much. I'll do that. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?",
