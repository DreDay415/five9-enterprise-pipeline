    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I was wondering if I could reorder my—\n\nSpeaker 1: Prescription. Okay, I need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Jeremiah Elquist, 651, or I'm sorry, 55045. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quiet Valley Road? This is a one-way. That's why I'm just, we have to turn around.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. People driving down one way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm a fire chief, too, so I got lights and flares in my car, so I put the lights on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, he scared him for sure, my bad. Okay, so I got you here at the Quiet Valley Road, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, Quiet Valley Road. Okay, so before you had done 22 pills. We don't actually have that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have 25 now. Is that what you're looking to do, something like that amount?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's exactly what I'm looking to do, something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 100 milligrams as well?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, same thing I had before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. So not only did you get a few more pills, you get a cheaper price now, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's only $113 instead of the $163.\n\nSpeaker 1: Love it. Yeah, it's great. And the last one is just the same card, 3337?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, is this why we start this? Was it coming out monthly, or was it coming out every other month?\n\nSpeaker 2: It would not be monthly if you don't want it that way. I can make it, like, even every four or five months if you prefer that.\n\nSpeaker 1: 25 come in the thing? Like, every other month would be perfect. Every 60 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, then I'll set you for every 60 days. That's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, can we do every 90 days?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do that, every three months. Set it for that. If you ever need to change again, just call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, I appreciate it. So when will that be shipped out, you think?\n\nSpeaker 1: Within a couple days. We just have to get your prescription updated because it did expire, but you don't have to do anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: But once that's done, we'll mail it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good. I appreciate it. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Bye-bye.",
