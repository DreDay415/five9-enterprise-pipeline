I called you before and you gave me your extension number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Donald.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. I sent those one pills back, like you said. I don't know if you guys got them or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me check. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 11-17-1957.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. We did not get them back yet, but we should get them back in a few days. I don't see it logged in yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then you just got your AGB delivered? Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I got them a couple days ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I tried it and they worked great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yay! That's what we like to hear.\n\nSpeaker 2: A lot better than the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly. A lot better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here, I'll just go ahead and issue you that refund now. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It might take up to 10 business days to show back on your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't have to wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you said these are cheaper than the other ones, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Give me one second. Hold on. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Successfully refunded. You'll be seeing $94.95 back on your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes it takes up to 10 business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, yeah, you're paying $94.95 for eight generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now, the AGB, a quantity of 10 is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's much better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. A quantity of 25 is $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the highest quantity is 40 for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was the next one up?\n\nSpeaker 1: 25 for $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I might do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to put an order now or do you want to –\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can because this one didn't cost me that you sent me this time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: At least I didn't think. I thought that's what you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, it didn't. No, it's free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, yeah, I'll do that. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then that would be every month, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: A quantity of 25 is every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's fine. That would be perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Perfect. Okay. 25. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Use the same card, MasterCard, ending in 9141?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. That went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll tell you your next refill date.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they would send you out a refill on March 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: March 27th? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. They'll ship this one out to you today, but then I'll send you the next one on the 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sounds great, Donald. Glad that worked out.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
