Just want to see if that went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Carlos Lopez, zip code 80123. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: South Otis Way. Yes, sir. Yeah, your order went through. You actually just got approved by the doctor not that long ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this will ship out within a day or so?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that's my next question on when I receive it. You send about a date?\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll ship in about a day. You'll get it in about a week from today.\n\nSpeaker 1: It may be a little faster, but you'll get an email sent to you with the tracking when it ships.\n\nSpeaker 2: Today it may be a little faster, but you'll get an email sent to you with the tracking when it ships.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need it and I don't need—\n\nSpeaker 1: Any repeat unless I—because it's the first time I'm trying. I want to try to work for me then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Thank you.",
