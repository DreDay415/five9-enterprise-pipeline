    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey James, yes. Hey, bud. Thank you so much for holding. So I did three things for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did exactly what you wanted and you needed. The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all—\n\nSpeaker 1: Monthly deals. And the second thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments. And the third thing I did—\n\nSpeaker 2: Is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I sent an email to Dr.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I set up your dashboard because I paused your prescription. And the way that looks is when you get a chance, go to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Scoreblue.com on your browser, your Google browser or your navigator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, log in with your Yahoo account. When you log in with your Yahoo account—\n\nSpeaker 2: You're gonna see in the category your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a red button with white font that says \"Quick Refill Now.\" Anytime, anywhere in the future—\n\nSpeaker 2: Should you need more, you click that button. We'll send it to you, okay, and two to three business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: I couldn't stop what was already in process, but I also put a—and I apologize about that—\n\nSpeaker 2: It was too late.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's already being labeled and shipped and there's a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I did put a button, a blue button that you can click that can—takes you to—\n\nSpeaker 1: The USPS page where you can track it. Okay, should get it by Monday or Tuesday, but just hold on to those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because we're all sold out of the hundreds. And if you need something else, like something stronger or anything else, you call me at—\n\nSpeaker 1: Zero zero three seven. Did you call the pharmacy? Did you call us? I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Called you and I wrote them. They told me to call you. Yeah, so just dial zero zero three seven, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that way if you need anything in the future, deal with me because my fingerprints are on this and as a veteran—\n\nSpeaker 2: Pride and honor in my work, but in—\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, everything you need it, but enough. Have fun. We're not here for a long time. We're here for a good time, but in—\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you, right? Okay. God bless you. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mark, yeah, 1124. Therefore I say to you, brother James, whatever things you ask when you pray—\n\nSpeaker 1: Believe that you receive them and they—you will have them. In Jesus' mighty name. All right, brother. God bless you. God bless you.",
