    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking\n\nSpeaker 2: with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is John McPherson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, John. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm okay. You?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. I'm pretty good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, John?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay, John, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-21-69.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And you're located at 1830 State Route 725, Lot 158 in Spring Valley, Ohio?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. So, yeah, I do see you here. Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular\n\nSpeaker 1: monthly refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the\n\nSpeaker 2: option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because\n\nSpeaker 1: six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it. And the way\n\nSpeaker 2: that would work is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can. You\n\nSpeaker 1: just have to give us a call to place the order directly yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, just go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they're not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. Okay, well, that makes sense. In that case, the last part of my job,\n\nSpeaker 2: again, is to mention to you that if the pills don't work for you, you do qualify for a free\n\nSpeaker 1: sample of our newest, highest quality products, because it looks like you haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So our newest stuff, it comes from our Pfizer labs in France, and it is the fastest-acting,\n\nSpeaker 1: longest-lasting stuff we've ever made. But my favorite thing about them is that we've\n\nSpeaker 2: specifically formulated them to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: The free sample would be 10 pills, and you're in Ohio, so if I sent them out to you today,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd probably get them by maybe as early as Saturday, but probably Monday or Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you would have until July to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure\n\nSpeaker 2: you prefer them to your old script. We believe that you would, and we believe that you'd\n\nSpeaker 1: give us a call in the next two to five months to order some, based off of the data and the\n\nSpeaker 2: reviews, and then we might be able to keep you, and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until July to let us know if\n\nSpeaker 2: they didn't work out for you. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Well, keep us in mind. You know where to find us, and we are the only sellers\n\nSpeaker 1: of that product in the world. We did a special deal with Pfizer to be able to say that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, we're always here, and we'd love to have you back to purchase that product.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample at a later date because there's a note\n\nSpeaker 2: that you denied this one, but you no longer have a prescription with us, and I hope you\n\nSpeaker 1: have a great day, John.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.",
