I need your name and zip code to start, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Jeff Brown, 98374.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, one second, Jeff.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: 120 to have and fuel up?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You have the pills with you right now, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just read to me the stamp on one of the pills itself, because that will confirm one way or the other for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, the stamp on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see, just a second here.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm driving, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: It says AC-335.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That tells me what I need to know. Your pill should have said 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're right. It was the regular generic, not the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you don't have to return that to us, because it was our mistake, but I am going to get you the right pill, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm going to message the pharmacy. They will get you ten of the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's no charge. You've already paid us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Sorry about the mix-up, but thank you for letting us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no problem. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Have a good weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
