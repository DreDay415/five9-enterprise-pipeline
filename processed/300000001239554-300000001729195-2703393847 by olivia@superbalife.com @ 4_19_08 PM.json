One moment while I notify the caller.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello? Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. I already said all of this and then...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I didn't hear you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, well, that's because you have a service set up so that once the phone picks up,\n\nSpeaker 2: somebody will say hello and then your Apple device, it has an introduction that says,\n\nSpeaker 1: we need to wait on hold to speak with you. But you called us, Jamie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am, I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did. So yeah, you might want to update your phone service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to cancel my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: January 4, 79.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're located at 558 Nelson Lane, Benton, Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And this refill from today, would you like to receive it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, if you can cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I just canceled and refunded that order.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you won't receive it, but you will see that refund within these next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months\n\nSpeaker 1: at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire\n\nSpeaker 2: if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then,\n\nSpeaker 2: you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, if you need anything before August 11, just give us a call at this number,\n\nSpeaker 2: Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And otherwise, your prescription is on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Jamie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thanks. Bye.",
