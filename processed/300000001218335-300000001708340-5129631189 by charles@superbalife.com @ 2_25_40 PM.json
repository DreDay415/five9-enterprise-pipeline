And I'm doing it again today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, gotcha. I'm not sure if you actually called the pharmacy by chance, so if you called the pharmacy, all they're going to do is delay the next shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: So right now, what I could do is cancel any future payments, shipments, and then the one that is on its way, when it arrives, don't touch it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't do anything to it other than write return to sender on it with a marker or a pen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Put it back in the mailbox, and the mailman will take it and send it back to us, and we can issue the refund then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
