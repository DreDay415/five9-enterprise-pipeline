And Mr. Robinson, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 44870.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Are you at 320 Douglas Drive in Sandusky, Ohio?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And are you calling to pause the monthly and just give that a little break?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or what can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to cancel this subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And are you canceling because the pills aren't a fit for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or is it because of the frequency?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just thought I don't need them anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been diagnosed with prostate cancer and had my prostate removed, so I have other pills now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: But thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I went ahead and canceled that for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
