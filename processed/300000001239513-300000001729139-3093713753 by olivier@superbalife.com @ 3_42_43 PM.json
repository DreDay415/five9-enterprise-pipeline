    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Iagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, is this a live person?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, well, good. About time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, how can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't know. I ordered the new AGV, and then I got mine. It says generic. Is this a bait and switch?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. So it says generic on the bottle, and the PIN says what, AC340?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it just says generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the bottle, you should have a code. I'm just curious. It says AC340 on the bottle or on the single PIN?\n\nSpeaker 2: The number on that is 600-107-08.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the actual field, what do you see, the small field, if you don't mind checking?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm checking here. Verified by ZOB. Dispense. Discard.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, on the actual field, if you can grab the small field in the bottle, there is something engraved on the field.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the field itself?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought it was supposed to say AGV on that, but it also said, in your advertising, it says to be ready in 11 minutes, and this says over an hour.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's something like a bait and switch here.\n\nSpeaker 2: What did it just say, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I can read this. I've got to get a magnifying glass.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, that's regular generic. I can send you a replacement with AGV. The PIN is going to say 5-0. That's the improved formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the bottle, usually as a standard, you always say it's a benefit of one hour, because that's just standard. That doesn't matter, but the code on the PIN will matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the one I send you is going to say 5-0, that's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why on the advertising, in the RU literature, it says 11 minutes? It sounds like a bait and switch.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because that's why it works. It works in 11 minutes, but the standard of the industry is to put one hour just on the bottle, just as a standard, because everybody is different.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they put a large window, but that new formula has been proven to have the fastest activation than anything before.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what you have is actually regular generic, so I need to replace that by the actual AGV, if you like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think the new stuff, and then bingo, I get this generic stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let's move forward, sir. I understood your concern, but we have a solution here, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why your order came and corrected at the pharmacy here for some reason, from what I see here, but I can correct that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can move forward. We have some AGV in stock that I can send to you, if you like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so now the pill is going to say 5-0. It's a different formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep those that you have right now as a backup, and FBI approved, made between the U.S. and France.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't need to return it. Get it as a backup, and I'm just going to send you the replacement on top of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's going to be a total of 20 pills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I sent the replacement, okay, a low 2 to 5 business day, you will get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill is going to have a different medical code on it, because the one that you will receive after is an improved formula, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And try it, and I hope that can be a good help for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Do you have my name and address, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, Mr. Charles Arlen in 175-145 Street, Seton, Illinois.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, yes, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
