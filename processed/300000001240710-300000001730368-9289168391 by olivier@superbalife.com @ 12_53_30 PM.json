How are you doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'd like to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I received some medication I didn't actually order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Raymond Solano?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, your prescription. I think from what I see here, I was able to pull the account. From what I see,\n\nSpeaker 2: the doctor wrote your prescription for Viagra on the Medi-Gram\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 tablet. We refill every 30 days, probably due to the quantity.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can tell the pharmacy to stop that for you and then, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: stop the 30 days and just pause that prescription. So you're just going to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just take the automatic prescription off.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm cutting the 30 days because you're not\n\nSpeaker 2: obligated to get every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's say, if you want to keep the price you have, just get two refill a year and they're always going to keep you\n\nSpeaker 2: at that price. But you don't necessarily need stuff every 30 days if you're not that active.\n\nSpeaker 1: They pause you up to half a year, so no more monthly and you can call to reorder. You lock your pricing, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Doctor consultation is available for you at any time. You're just not going to get every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you are set, okay? Thank you, sir.",
