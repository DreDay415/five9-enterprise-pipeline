I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Guzwan Fidel and I ordered some of the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, instead of $40, they sent me $80.\n\nSpeaker 2: And now they sent me another email that I'm going to get another order.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your last name and zip code? You must have added a bonus package to your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: F like Frank, U be like David, IL, zip code 91207.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I pulled up your account. So you ordered 40 pills for $163.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then you selected an additional add-on bonus where you can get double your pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what they told me, but honestly, I did not select that option.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they sent me 80 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the reason why they sent you 80 pills is because it was selected, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you received this quite some time ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there a reason why you were calling us? Because you got an email, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I got an email because I sent you an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, they sent me an email. They sent me an email.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to send me another shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had to use them.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they haven't sent you anything yet, and they're not going to as of now, what I'm seeing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Other than that, it looks like the way that they will get refilled through the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: because these are prescriptions through Pfizer, it's going to be April 13th.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I could do for you is just freeze it out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you have an opportunity to try them,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you can call us back if you decide you want to keep it active or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, don't send me anymore, please. You can freeze it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'll freeze it, so that way you can just call us back once you try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: As soon as you try them and you see if you like them or not, call us back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you can make a final choice there and then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so please don't send anymore. Freeze the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'll tell you, just call us back once you try them out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there like a confirmation number or something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a confirmation number, but you can go to your account later on,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'll see that it's been postponed out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're not going to receive anything for the next few months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just go ahead and call us once you try them, so that way you can make a final decision\n\nSpeaker 1: if you want to stick with these or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.
