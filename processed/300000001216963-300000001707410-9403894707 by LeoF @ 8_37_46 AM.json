    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was calling to check on my subscriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you with that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, can I have your first name, last name, date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Brian, B-R-I-A-N, Doolin, D-O-O-L-I-N-G, and it's 10-23-72.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty, Mr. Doolin, I have your information up here and what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So, I initially ordered from you guys for one shot of these to try them out,\n\nSpeaker 2: but for some reason I received a second one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ah, I get you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't order that. You guys hit me for 63 bucks.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't finish the first one and it didn't really work that well for me, so I wasn't going to order it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't work out that good and you weren't planning on getting a second order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do understand, Mr. Doolin.\n\nSpeaker 2: That second order that just arrived, if you didn't want to keep that, of course you didn't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually I encourage guys like yourself when it happens to hang on to them and have a two-year shelf life,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you're saying they didn't work that well anyway, so it doesn't sound like you would want to hang on to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send you return instructions to your email if you didn't want to keep that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's up to you, of course, whether or not to.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you say you didn't get any effect out of the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have those pills there in front of you, Mr. Doolin?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't. I'm at work now, but they're at the house. I've taken one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get you. It just didn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just didn't do what I thought it was going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wasn't intending on keeping the subscription, so I didn't understand why I got a second one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can cancel that for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to let you know, though, it sounds like you may have gotten the incorrect thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: A couple of guys like yourself have called me saying,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, you know, I didn't get any results out of the medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm like, okay, let's see what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have them check out the pills, the markings on them, and it turns out they did get a different generic\n\nSpeaker 1: because we do sell two different kinds.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you wanted, what I would love to do, I could offer you is to send you a replacement 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted to try out this new batch I'd send you, I think it would be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't confirm that you got the wrong thing there, but it does sound like it if you're saying maybe you got a little bit of results,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it didn't work stellar how you were expecting.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wouldn't charge you for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just wanted to offer you that before I did cancel everything out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would pause the account if we went that route.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you wouldn't get anything else like in the next 30 days or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm actually okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am going to my actual doctor, and he gave me some good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go ahead and cancel this out for you, Mr. Dooling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once I do, I won't be able to fill the prescription for you again in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to make sure you were aware.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I did go ahead and cancel it out for you then.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set there, and then I sent you those return instructions.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you didn't want to keep those closed, you didn't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, I always encourage guys to hang on to them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But either way, you'll have those there in your inbox, the instructions, if you do decide to return.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will that give me a refund to my account for the second one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you send those to my email?\n\nSpeaker 1: I did, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Teller101atyahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.",
