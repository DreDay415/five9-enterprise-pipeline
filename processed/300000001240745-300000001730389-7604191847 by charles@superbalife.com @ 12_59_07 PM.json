Okay, fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you are interested, just to hail a merry pass here,\n\nSpeaker 2: we do have a different variation of the Viagra AGV that's made in our France factory,\n\nSpeaker 1: completely different from what you've been receiving.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you're interested, I can send you a sample of that for free to try,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can kind of compare apples to apples between your VA stuff versus our stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then call us back within the next five months and let us know which side you're leaning towards.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you want to send me, that's that new one, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send 10 pills for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try them out, write my extension down or memorize whichever one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Memorize it, 0040, my name is Charles,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then give me a call back in a couple months and let me know what the deal is, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, thank you. Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely. All right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pill that you're looking for, Cory, we'll have the number 100 pressed onto it like a stamp, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but the ones that I'm getting now, you're going to cancel all those.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to get that anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sounds good. All right, Cory, I hope you have a great rest of your day then, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.
