    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Lonzo, yes, okay, but I did three things for you and at the end of the call give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you just deal with me personally because you got passed on several times to four people and as a veteran.\n\nSpeaker 1: I take a lot of honor and pride in what I do. So just hear me out real quick.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did three things. The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all—\n\nSpeaker 1: Monthly refills. The second thing is I put a stop to any and all monthly—\n\nSpeaker 2: Shipments and the third thing is I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges and I paused your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I elevated you to the elite status and I pushed this last batch through so you can get it sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully you get it by Thursday or Friday at best.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: But and then in light of all this, in light of all this, when you go to scoreblue.com on your, your, your Chrome—\n\nSpeaker 1: Browser or your navigator on your phone?\n\nSpeaker 2: Login with your Gmail account. Okay. Okay, login with your Gmail account. You're going to go to a category that's called your—\n\nSpeaker 1: Prescription. Okay. Okay, in that category—\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to see a red button with white font that says quick refill now any time—\n\nSpeaker 1: Anywhere, any place you can click that button.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if you update your address to Vegas and you put your hotel room number you can click that button.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll send it to the hotel.\n\nSpeaker 2: All you have to do then is tip the butler and tell him to send the ladies up so you could do a ménage à trois.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now the only caveat to this but is that legally we're not authorized—\n\nSpeaker 2: To send you more than one refill in a 30-day period or two refills within a one-year period.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just if you need more, like you want to stay at 40—\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know if you want to go down. Let me know if you need something stronger.\n\nSpeaker 1: You need the blue pill, but you can click that button. You should be good to go for the next six months. All right, okay, so—\n\nSpeaker 2: What, what do I have?\n\nSpeaker 1: You have—I thought that was a stronger—\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the AGV, the strongest, but something that's comparable to this, but it's way more expensive, the blue—\n\nSpeaker 1: Original Viagra, right? It's just not time or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it is, it is like the king of the crop but it's a hundred dollars a pill, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I don't know if you want to go there, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, yeah, but just let me know because I can do lateral moves to see Alice daily.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cialis, the blue pill, but you have the best stuff because it's time release.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I can see purity and punch so it lasts long as you know, you tried it but you've been with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah, I like it. You like long Kong King Kong, but yes one. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Use that. Okay, use that, use that button or call me. My extension, Lonzo, is—\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what now?\n\nSpeaker 1: KT like killer testicle or killer tomato KT. Yeah, Goodrich last name.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodrich. Yeah, and if you get a chance, bud, tonight because I'm up for review as a veteran, you know—\n\nSpeaker 1: I could just—I don't get much service connected, but—and I was homeless during COVID.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just—I'm not asking you to feel sorry for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we're in here in LA, man, and you know, like I don't want to get evicted, you know, I mean, I, you know—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like 20, you know, anywhere you're at, bro. We're paying 20 cents of the dollar and—\n\nSpeaker 1: This is four grand out here, but so I need a raise, but if you can write a review, what support at—\n\nSpeaker 2: school.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Support. Oh, yes, or blue.com. Just write a review like go to support@scoreblue.com and just send an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just be honest, you know, like with the good, bad, or ugly, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let them know what your experience was like and how I took care of you and, you know, whatever it takes.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you know, anything without any blessings, but oh, I got you. Yeah, you really—\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes. I will appreciate you, mental on cell, man, you know, and I appreciate you and you let me know how I can—\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care of you and, you know, you just call me. I'll make it happen. All right, but okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so that's how we roll this one, get right, so this one gets pushed through and they won't trust me no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how I push the button.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. The way the timer is set up is when you push this button—\n\nSpeaker 2: It pushes it out for another six months and you can only get one refill per month, but you can push it—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can't do it more than 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you do it out 31 or 32 days—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can click it and if you can't do it less than twice a year as long as you're getting it twice a year, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many are good?\n\nSpeaker 2: This run you're getting 40, okay, you're good, but I think this one, yeah, you bet.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. All right, but yeah, you're very welcome. Oh, that's how we roll then. We're Americans.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've got a story for each other. That's it. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't care what everyone else does but our generation—\n\nSpeaker 2: We have to have it's automatic.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I was saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just and if you get a chance just email support at blue and please I get it anything you can pour blue—\n\nSpeaker 2: I got calm calm calm. I got you. I'm gonna do it. All right. All right. Thank you. God bless you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless and be well.",
