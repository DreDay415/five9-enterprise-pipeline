    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, yeah. I just placed an order and I just saw you guys had shipped it to the wrong address.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's why I screwed up. But, um, I'll never get it at that address.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: First name is Blake. Last name is Lauer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 2-21-61.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. And the address I have here is 20-66 North Brabant.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, Meltzer, when I did the online order with the blue score,\n\nSpeaker 2: I felt 99.9% sure I put 1-1-5-0 Evergreen Lane, Charlevoix, Michigan,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I don't live at that address anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't know what happened there. If you did it online, I think it would have been user error.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, yeah, as a one-time courtesy, you don't have access to the old address anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir. When I sold the house, I don't live there anymore. I'm like 200 miles away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, yeah, as a one-time courtesy, of course, I can do a reshipment for you, Mr. Blake.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the new address you want to be on file now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 1-1-5-5-0 Evergreen Lane, Charlevoix, Michigan, 49720.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a change of address with the post office, but I don't receive a check.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: 49720?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, no worries. I'm going to take care of this for you. Give me just a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries. We'll fix this for you. It won't happen again. All good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so 1-1-5-5-0 Evergreen Lane, Charlevoix, Michigan, 49720. Sorry if I mispronounced that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's okay. I can't even spell it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, so you're all set. You'll see that order shipped there, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, no problem. Thank you.",
