Have you ever tried Cialis before, John?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't mean to make you like a guinea pig or anything like that, I just want to see if there's anything we have that could work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I haven't.\n\nSpeaker 2: You haven't tried Cialis? If you'd like, I could send you out a bottle of Cialis, four free pills of Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's supposed to be, it's a lot better of a pill, I'm not going to lie, it lasts a lot longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not trying to give you a hard time or anything, Charles, but that's what you said about the last time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I understand, but I mean, that was Viagra, okay, so this is a completely different drug.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Tadalafil, Viagra is Sildenafil. Okay, some guys are Viagra guys, some guys are Cialis guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, if you are willing to, I could send you four free pills of the Cialis to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what about my money back for this stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if you want to just cancel everything, yeah, just send everything back to the Southgate, Kentucky address and we'll issue the money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, fine, we'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, alright, I'm sorry it didn't work out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, me too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, how do I send this stuff back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Through U.S. Postal Service or UPS, the Southgate, Kentucky address that's on the pill bottle, send it back to them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once they have everything back, they'll issue the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once they get everything back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, I'll start getting them together now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, sounds good, hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if I wouldn't have known it was going to be this, I mean, I just would have gotten my money back the last time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty, hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you understand what I'm saying, right? I mean, I kind of get it all the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I understand. Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, alright.",
