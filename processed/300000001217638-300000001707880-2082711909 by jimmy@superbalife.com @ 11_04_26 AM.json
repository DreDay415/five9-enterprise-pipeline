    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Jimmy, I received a refill that I didn't think I signed up for.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm wondering why I received that refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told the guy when I called and ordered the first one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to give it a try before I continued ordering.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me try to pull up your information.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to deal with the phone number that you're calling from, and that is coming up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there another number maybe when you did your order?\n\nSpeaker 1: 714-264-2980.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Is this Brian I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Brian. I do have you up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see that you are currently getting the Viagra, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like that you're getting the AGV, 10 of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it looks like your prescription did have you set up for every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that too frequent?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told the guy it was the first time I'd ever decided to try it,\n\nSpeaker 1: that I wanted to try it before I bought more or got on any kind of automatic thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I need them, I'll call them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, see, let me explain to you how the OGV works for you, Brian, real quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm going to have to take care of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm doing for you right now, I'm stopping the monthly shipments,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm stopping the monthly refills that's included with the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm also stopping the monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, see, the AGV is a whole different beast,\n\nSpeaker 2: because in order to get that going forward, if you ever want it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do have to be on some type of prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't have to be every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can push that back or we can pause it for you to keep the prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you just cancel it altogether,\n\nSpeaker 1: that means you wouldn't be able to get the AGV with us again,\n\nSpeaker 2: because we have to have some type of prescription on file in order to give out the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: because the AGV is one of the most popular varieties out there, and everybody wants it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And since it's coming from the Firesafe Labs in France,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's basically one of those things that's constantly running out and was sold out,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we only have a supply for the individuals for new orders\n\nSpeaker 1: or for clients that have a prescribed prescription with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if every month is too busy, we can push you out to like four or five months,\n\nSpeaker 1: and what that does, that allows you to order when you want to,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if four or five months come too soon,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can just call us and say push me back another few months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not ready for it yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: That does a few things for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It keeps you at the discounted price because it's not going to go up when the tariffs hit.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let's not kill this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's push it out six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Push it out six months, and if I need any within the six months, I just call and ask for a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right, but don't go out.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I haven't even got through the first ten pills yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if six months come too soon,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can always reach back and tell us to push it back a few more months for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Therefore, that will keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not going to continue to automatically get ten pills every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just took care of that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: As a matter of fact, I'll give you the date.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're looking at July 17th, so reach out before July 17th if you need to push it back,\n\nSpeaker 2: and plus you can order any time before then if you choose to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get a confirmation e-mail that it's been handled?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got your e-mail address at brian at, is that tripmediaservices.com?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, Brian.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll shoot that e-mail out to you in just a couple of minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.",
