    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hello, how we doing sir? I'm doing fine, and how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Thank you for asking. May I have the phone number linked to your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: 269.\n\nSpeaker 1: 207 1618.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Lawrence Curtis, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I see that you have a Viagra prescription, 100 milligrams from Dr. Botoni, 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: What can I help you with, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel the prescription. The medication gives me such a horrible headache. I can't use it. Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: First time taking 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you used to take what, 50 or 25?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I mean, I can have a... but it doesn't work. 50 don't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it never worked. Viagra never worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a little bit a few years ago, but I was hoping 100 milligrams would do something, but yeah, I took it there was...\n\nSpeaker 2: Such a headache. I couldn't do anything if I wanted to. And then did you try Cialis in the past?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I haven't tried Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So what we could do, I can stop your current prescription of the Viagra with the pharmacy from Dr.\n\nSpeaker 1: Botoni, and I can send you four pills as samples for Cialis so you can try them and...\n\nSpeaker 2: If they work for you, just call to confirm and we can make that your new prescription and then...\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to get it also every 30 days. I can have the doctor writing as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can order as needed as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, maybe you can get a chance with Cialis because the two-pole either Viagra or Cialis for men.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why, but that's one of those things.\n\nSpeaker 1: By the same time, I can stop...\n\nSpeaker 2: The Viagra prescription and then you can try that and call, you know, you're going to receive it too. Yeah, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you won't start another automatic...\n\nSpeaker 2: Shipment though, will you, of Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so what we're going to do, we're going to pause that, pause up to half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then you get your sample for them. Give us a call. Take your time. Try the 20 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the biggest for Cialis. It's a little different. It was different than the Viagra and then...\n\nSpeaker 2: As you use it, if it works, you just call us back and we're gonna arrange your account and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, you know, I tried the Cialis, that's a better fit for me or this is not a better fit for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we know that, okay, we were not able to help or we were able to help and we make adjustment to the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what happens after six months though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Now that's just to have the opportunity to serve you, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But you call us as soon as you get the four pills, you try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pretty sure in a few weeks you'll be done with that and you call and we're gonna adjust the account. If it didn't work...\n\nSpeaker 1: We're just gonna...\n\nSpeaker 2: Gonna close everything for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well just assure me that you're not going to start sending automatic shipments because I don't know that I'll be...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, but you will call when you get the four pills, right, to let us know if that helped you or no.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I...\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's up to you. I'm just trying to offer a solution if you think that all sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have to do that though. I'm trying to find a way so you can have maybe a better...\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I don't think I want to do that. Okay, experience was just not good.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I was with the Viagra, not with Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know. I know, but I know that these medications have similar side effects. So...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, usually this is a better one as far as side effects. Like I said, you do your research and you will find...\n\nSpeaker 2: When the Viagra is not your friend, Cialis will be, and vice versa. Why the science hasn't figured out yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a body chemistry thing, biochemistry, but I can't sell you account here, Mr. Curtis, and yeah, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for your help today.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. All right. You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye. Bye.",
