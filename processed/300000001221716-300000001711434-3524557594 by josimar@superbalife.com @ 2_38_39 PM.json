    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I'm trying to call someone about an order that was placed, and then after the order was placed it said it's a subscription. I need to make sure that that is not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: By any chance is the male patient available?\n\nSpeaker 1: Since it is through HIPAA regulations, we are required to speak to the male patient.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know that it was in his name, but okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it has to be in his name.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's required to speak to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the male patient, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your zip code and your last name, please, in order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not in order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Candidate and 34788.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 34788.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your first name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Bobby.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Basically, let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yes, every order in the AG Viagra needs to be on a refill date to be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't mean you need to get the refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Explain that to her for me, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to talk to the patient.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can have it on the speaker, though, but I do need to make sure you're on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Say it again now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so every order of the AG Viagra requires a refill date to become active.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't need to take the second order.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just need to have a refill date.\n\nSpeaker 1: In this case, what I could do for you guys to make sure this is properly sent out and delivered,\n\nSpeaker 2: I could just freeze it out for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you receive the AG Viagra, try it out and give us a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let us know if you want to keep it or change the frequency or if you decide to just stop all orders\n\nSpeaker 2: because that would eliminate the visit and you won't be able to order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But at least for the first order to be shipped out, it does require the date.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't want it six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted, like, one pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to keep it that long.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm not sure if you were able to just hear what I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: I explained quite a lot right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It needs to have a refill date to be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if you want just one, it needs a refill date to be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you could call us afterwards even to make any modifications.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it on my thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want no prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to wait six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want it off.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, did you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Were you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure if you're hearing me, sir, because what part are you missing right here?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not telling you you need to wait six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: What part were you not understanding?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to help better understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I know how it works, because they'll bill you for it when you don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just explained to you, sir, the order needs to have a refill date to be sent out and delivered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Without the refill date, the order cannot be sent out and delivered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hasn't it been shipped already?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it hasn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's still at the USPS waiting for a label, I believe.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, what I'm trying to tell you is I'm going to freeze it for six months so you don't receive an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, when you get your order, call us back and make the final decision there if you want to just cancel it entirely\n\nSpeaker 2: or if you want to adjust your frequency.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I can do that as soon as I get the prescription in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, then I'll call you back when I get it done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us back.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you can receive your first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then let us know what the final choice will be based on once you get your order, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you said that it was sitting waiting to be shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent me a message.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's at the USPS with the label right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, but they sent me one on my phone and said it was already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they sent you the tracking number, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: That doesn't mean the package is shipped out from the facility.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and there's no way to stop it even though it ain't been mailed yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, because it's been approved and sent out through the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: All you have to do is call us back once you get your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
