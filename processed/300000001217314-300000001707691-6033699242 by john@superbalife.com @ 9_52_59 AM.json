I'm in the hospital and I just got a hip replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could I cancel my next delivery, which would be in February?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. I need your name and zip code, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Joel Elber, E-L-B-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Zip code, 0-3-3-0-1.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Cozy Trill, 8 Cozy Trill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Rather than cancel, do you want me to just put a pause on it for a few months for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can, like, do April or May if that gives you some time to recover and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Oh, absolutely. That'd be fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. May or April?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see. We'll, January, February. Let's do April.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good. So I've gone ahead and done that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish you the best in your recovery, sir, but everything's paused until April 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
