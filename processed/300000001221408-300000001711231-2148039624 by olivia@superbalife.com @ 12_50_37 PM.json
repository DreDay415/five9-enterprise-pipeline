    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Ernesto Reyes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Ernesto. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. I love to hear that. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I need to cancel my service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. Okay, Ernesto, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1870.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 785 West Wheatland Road, Unit 112, Duncanville, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah, so I do see your prescription here. All right, well, just so you know, Ernesto, you do always have the option with your prescription. If you don't want to receive those regular monthly refills, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it. And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then you could, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you are ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. All right, so yeah, if you need anything before the end of July the 28th, just give us a call this number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific. We're always here. Otherwise, your prescription is on hold, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but it's already canceled, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so if you, the prescription is on hold for you, so you would be able to still order within the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, as long as it's canceled, that's all that matters.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like your monthly, your ongoing refills, those are canceled. Yeah, but the script is on hold, like it's been placed on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's fine. As long as my card doesn't get charged, it would count.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you. Have a great day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet.",
