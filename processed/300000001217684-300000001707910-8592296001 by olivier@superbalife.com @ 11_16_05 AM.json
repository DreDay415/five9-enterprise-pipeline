    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hello. Hello, how are we doing, sir? Not bad. Okay, Mr. Walter Lomo?\n\nSpeaker 2: That it is. Okay, I'm pulling your prescription here. All right, so I see\n\nSpeaker 1: that you have a prescription for Viagra 15 milligram. We sent\n\nSpeaker 2: you a replacement, Viagra AGV. We just sent you an activator. Yeah, how may I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, for starters, there's the prescription for the 50. I was supposed\n\nSpeaker 2: to get the ABG. I never got the ABG. I got the reorder of the 50 milligram. I\n\nSpeaker 1: called at that point in time and said I didn't want it. They said that, oh we'll\n\nSpeaker 2: just send it back. We'll refund it and get you the right stuff out. Not only has\n\nSpeaker 1: it never been refunded, but I never got the right stuff out and I just want to\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure that it's canceled so I don't get another order and go through the\n\nSpeaker 1: rigmarole again. Okay, I mean the replacement we sent you is the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a different code on the pill than what you have. They might look alike, but\n\nSpeaker 1: they're different. I never got the package. You never got a replacement? No, I\n\nSpeaker 2: never got the replacement. When I did get them the next time, I was\n\nSpeaker 1: supposed to get like an activator and some other things. I never received that\n\nSpeaker 2: either. So what is your what is your address, sir, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 933 Springwood Court in Lexington. Yeah, that's what we have and the post\n\nSpeaker 2: office told us that, you know, they deliver on the 3rd. Do you have anybody\n\nSpeaker 1: accessing your mailbox by chance? No. Yeah, that's just really strange. The post\n\nSpeaker 2: office updated, say on the November 3rd, they deliver at 1:10 p.m. Yes, at 1:10 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: and that was a regular order of the 50 milligram that I called and\n\nSpeaker 2: supposedly was going to get the activator sent out and that didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: happen. So you didn't receive the replacement, the free replacement, that's what you're saying? I did not receive the free\n\nSpeaker 2: replacement. Oh wow. So I mean and basically right now is, you know, the 50\n\nSpeaker 1: milligram is garbage to me for two reasons. One, it doesn't effectively work.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other thing too is I have a hundred milligram covered under my insurance and\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have to pay anything for it. So it's lunacy for me to pay what is it, $60\n\nSpeaker 2: for a medicine that I already got free. So I just want to make sure that my\n\nSpeaker 1: order is canceled and I'm not going to be getting a third bottle here in the\n\nSpeaker 2: next upcoming days. Okay, I mean you could pause the prescription. You don't have to\n\nSpeaker 1: get it every month. You can pause and get it once or twice a year. That's an option\n\nSpeaker 2: that you have. I'm just throwing it out there. Yes, well like I said, right now I just\n\nSpeaker 1: want to cancel it. Okay. Yes. All right. Just keep in mind if anything changed, sir, the\n\nSpeaker 2: price probably would be different because when I'm canceling you here, I\n\nSpeaker 1: got to lose the prescription they finance under your name initially. So\n\nSpeaker 2: they're gonna have to get another one, another doctor evaluation because\n\nSpeaker 1: legally they cannot send you anything without the doctor writing it, right? So\n\nSpeaker 2: that being said, because they're gonna have to reinvest on your initial\n\nSpeaker 1: consultation, your price might be different in the future. I just want you\n\nSpeaker 2: to be aware of that. If you try to reorder and feel like everything is\n\nSpeaker 1: bumped up, it's because they got to refinance your new doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I canceled what you have, the currently one, canceled the account and\n\nSpeaker 1: you're good to go. Okay, thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye bye. Okay.",
