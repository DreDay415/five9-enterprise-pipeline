I can tell you how much they were.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second, because I need to make sure I have...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, okay. So, you got two accounts open, so that will probably explain it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one second. Let me... Both in Northgate. Yeah, you got two accounts open, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to do it online and it wouldn't let me do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know... Do me a favor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Next time, from here on out, let's just do everything over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call this same number. We're very customer friendly, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And we'll do things a lot more faster on our end.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And avoid doing double accounts.
