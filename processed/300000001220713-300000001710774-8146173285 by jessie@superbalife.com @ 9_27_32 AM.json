    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Douglas Repogel.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 16650.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you at 285 Jack's Corner Road in Hopewell, PA?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you wanted to check on the status of your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your last order was back in December,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the next one won't be until February.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that what you wanted?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I usually got it like every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sign them like every 30 days or 31 days or something like\n\nSpeaker 2: that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and process that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, one moment, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's 25 pills, and we have a VDON file that ends in 1530.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the card we should use?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that's the card we should use.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think what happened here is because your package has\n\nSpeaker 2: increased to 25 pills, the pharmacy needs,\n\nSpeaker 1: they changed their, whatchamacallit,\n\nSpeaker 2: the frequency of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, we'll get the 25 out to you, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when should I expect for next month,\n\nSpeaker 2: then, will it be like, I don't know,\n\nSpeaker 1: when should I expect for next month,\n\nSpeaker 2: then, will it be like, it's usually monthly or about 32\n\nSpeaker 1: days or something that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wonder, because I usually begin them every month about\n\nSpeaker 1: like 30, 31 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: The last couple of times I've had to call because it didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't go through, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to see if we can set this up for, I believe it's 1.5\n\nSpeaker 1: days.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's about every 35 days would be.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a rough idea, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I don't see them, then I'll have a call or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and set that up for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if it's March 29, I'd expect this\n\nSpeaker 1: to get charged by April 3.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, that's probably where it's going to land, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: That doesn't sound right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a bit far.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see, January 28, February 28, about February 6\n\nSpeaker 1: is what you're looking at.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, so this order won't be shipped out to February 6,\n\nSpeaker 2: then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because a month from now, so today is January 28.\n\nSpeaker 2: A month from now is February 28.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, March 6.\n\nSpeaker 2: March 6 would be the case.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to charge you ahead of time,\n\nSpeaker 2: because then the pharmacy will hold it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think, actually, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to think of the easiest way to do this\n\nSpeaker 2: without giving you grief.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because like I said, I was getting them like every 30.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think they said it was a minimum of 31 days\n\nSpeaker 1: the last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the last couple of months now, I don't know,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was 22, and they changed it to 25 or 113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I've had to call like the last three months now.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, so here's what I've done instead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've just set your charge to be every once a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the pharmacy will adjust\n\nSpeaker 2: it to ship it about five days after it's charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: So then they'll follow their timer,\n\nSpeaker 1: but at least you know you get charged once a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they just hold it for a few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can expect it to arrive like a week\n\nSpeaker 2: after you get charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so I'm looking at what, next week sometime then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you're looking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this will arrive within the week for sure, for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and that's 113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, 113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll get that out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll notify the pharmacy to ship this out now, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you don't have to wait any longer than you already have.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, because like I said, it was like,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think they told me a minimum was like 31 or 32 days\n\nSpeaker 1: or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I had it set up before to 22,000.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't have to call or nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just showed up about every month\n\nSpeaker 1: towards the end of the month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do the same with this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just ask them to ship it out as close to that 30 day\n\nSpeaker 2: mark as possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: They have to do the calculations.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't do the calculations.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know, it's a thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.",
