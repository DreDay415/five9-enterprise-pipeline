    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm calling because you guys made a charge on my card\n\nSpeaker 2: that I did not authorize, and I'm not sure why you did it.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, so let me pull up your chart here for your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll see what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Damian Davis, 9-10-68.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Damian, I'm looking here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've been a patient of ours since 2022,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you have an active prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: of the quantity of 72 20-milligram sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what happened here was, so traditionally,\n\nSpeaker 1: the doctors write these refills on a three-month basis\n\nSpeaker 2: for a quantity of 72, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: You have been frequently receiving\n\nSpeaker 2: these monthly or bimonthly, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: So this was an order that went through\n\nSpeaker 2: to keep the prescription active based on the current schedule.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is just part of your current frequency.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, well, I didn't want it, and I want the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't ask you to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never asked you to send it to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: No one said charge anything on my account,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm not sure why you're charging stuff on my account\n\nSpeaker 1: without my authorization.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, sir, you've been getting this monthly\n\nSpeaker 1: for the past two years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand what I've been doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been ordering it when I want to order it,\n\nSpeaker 2: not when you tell me to order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it is just, Damian, Mr. Davis, I can do this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just, so there's ways we can do this, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm just saying, this is how, for the past three years,\n\nSpeaker 2: nothing has changed on your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is just how it was initially made,\n\nSpeaker 2: and because nothing was adjusted,\n\nSpeaker 1: this is how it went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't want any future prescriptions without you\n\nSpeaker 1: calling, we need to put your account on a pause, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: And we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: After I get my refund, I'm closing this account,\n\nSpeaker 2: because this isn't happening again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, I can close it for you, or I\n\nSpeaker 2: mean, it's simple.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you've been a VIP with us for years now, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm just confused.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you weren't, I'm just not sure why you\n\nSpeaker 2: weren't expecting this refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is, like I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I wasn't expecting it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Look it, if I want to refill it, I'm not yelling at you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You are.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not yelling at you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll issue a refund, but I'm just trying to help you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm confused, because you've been taking medication\n\nSpeaker 2: for three or four years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, are you going to let me talk?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you let me talk, I'll tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I get it that you do it, but I'll\n\nSpeaker 2: order it when I want to order it,\n\nSpeaker 1: not when you tell me to order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that fine?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, so what's the problem?\n\nSpeaker 2: We can adjust it to that way, but it was never adjusted\n\nSpeaker 1: that way for the past three years.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can adjust it to where you can order as needed,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that setting was never adjusted in your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we can adjust it accordingly.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can do that for you, and I can get you\n\nSpeaker 2: a refund for the prescription that went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can do all of this, but we just\n\nSpeaker 2: need to communicate about it, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: I am trying to communicate.\n\nSpeaker 2: So sir, the most recent prescription that went through\n\nSpeaker 1: is set to arrive today in between 9:45 and 12:45 noon,\n\nSpeaker 2: OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want that prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you want to return it for a refund, all you have to do\n\nSpeaker 1: is write return to sender on that package, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: Any future prescriptions, if you want\n\nSpeaker 1: to have the ability to call in and place orders as needed,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can put a pause on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is how we want to adjust your account to have\n\nSpeaker 2: you have power in your hands.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can either hop online and place an order,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you can give us a call and place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we have to adjust those settings accordingly\n\nSpeaker 2: on your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I never had any problems before on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: It isn't like a recurring prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: where it keeps sending stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has where you order it when you want to order it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I've never had any problem with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then now you just send it to me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm just like, well, I didn't ask for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, so the reason why you never.\n\nSpeaker 1: So initially, so I'll explain.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when the doctor writes a prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: for a quantity of 72, they're assuming\n\nSpeaker 2: that's a three-month supply, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, in your case, you've been getting refills of this\n\nSpeaker 2: every month or every two months for the past three years.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the reason, nothing has changed on your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But the only reason this issue occurred now\n\nSpeaker 2: is because you never placed a refill order\n\nSpeaker 1: or we never adjusted the settings.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I know this might be a surprise,\n\nSpeaker 1: but nothing has changed on your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: for the past three years.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you want to long term adjust it to where, yes,\n\nSpeaker 2: you want to call in and place orders as needed,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I just need to adjust it on my end.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it's fixed.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's solved.\n\nSpeaker 1: This will never happen again.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do I need to do now to get my refund?\n\nSpeaker 1: All you have to do is put return to sender on that package, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's in your mailbox here soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: And stick it right back in your mailbox\n\nSpeaker 2: or drop it off at USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: But so I have to repackage it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't even open it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just put RTS, return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very easy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll have to pay for the postage, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do not have to pay for postage.\n\nSpeaker 1: That package, if you put RTS on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: that is a free return label.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then to prevent this from happening in the future,\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to adjust your settings here,\n\nSpeaker 1: where we put it on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now if you need this in a month or two,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can just give us a call or do it online.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we need to put a pause on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess that the reason why this has never been an issue\n\nSpeaker 2: is because you've been frequently placing orders\n\nSpeaker 1: every one or two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I never had this issue.\n\nSpeaker 1: The reason I was upset, because I'm like,\n\nSpeaker 2: why are you charging my account when I didn't authorize you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't appreciate people charging me.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it's on some random subscription thing\n\nSpeaker 1: and I didn't turn it off, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it wasn't on any random subscription thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I'm like, why are you charging my card when\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't authorize it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the settings never changed at all since May of 22.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've just been getting it every single month\n\nSpeaker 1: or every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's been three months now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's how the doctor initially\n\nSpeaker 2: set it up back in 2022.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just never saw this issue because it's never really\n\nSpeaker 2: arisen.\n\nSpeaker 1: But in order for this to be bypassed, we can adjust it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's to your needs.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me put this on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this will allow you to just call in for future orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing will go through automatically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Davis?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you like to get that on a pause for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and made those adjustments for you, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just have to put return to sender and send it back\n\nSpeaker 1: and get my refund, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all you have to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all you have to do is put return to sender\n\nSpeaker 2: on that package, put it back in the mail,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you'll be issued a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't have issues of yelling.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was like, I don't appreciate people using my card\n\nSpeaker 2: without my authorization.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, there's too much stuff going on today.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then charges come up on your card.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm like, what the hell is this?\n\nSpeaker 2: I know how it can be a surprise.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, it's just how the doctor initially\n\nSpeaker 2: set it up back in 2022.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just, you know, you've been getting me so frequently\n\nSpeaker 2: that this hasn't occurred.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I went ahead and put the pause on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: so this won't happen again until you call, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
