They'll have regular generic on the bottle, but the pills will be AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll either have an AP330 or something like that, or a number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: One of them is made in America and one of them is made in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: So depending on which one you get, they're both really, really great pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then I don't have a recurring order, do I?\n\nSpeaker 1: You do have refills set up. It does look like your next one is due for February.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to push that out to May or June?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to do June?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I guess I'll do June, and then if that doesn't work, then I might just get an order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, just give us a call and let us know what the deal is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we're very customer friendly here. Just work with us and we'll work with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well I'll do the one more in June thing. That's for $62, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then I'll see what happens there then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good. Just give us a call if you need them or they're okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Have a great day.",
