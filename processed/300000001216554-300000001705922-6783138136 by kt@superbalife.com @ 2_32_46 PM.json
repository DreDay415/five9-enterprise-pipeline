    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Pat, yeah, and thank you so much for holding me up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get this feedback, but I'm gonna do the best I can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it's really ringing in my ears,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's really hurting my ears.\n\nSpeaker 1: But nevertheless, I'll work through it, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what we do.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the first thing, I did exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing I did is I put a stop\n\nSpeaker 1: to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second thing I did is I put a stop,\n\nSpeaker 1: as you wish, to any and all monthly refills\n\nSpeaker 2: that the doctor prescribed.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I put a stop to any and all monthly charges,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I paused your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I started the credit process for the 4029\n\nSpeaker 2: that you were charged for that refill that was sent out.\n\nSpeaker 1: In light of that, please refuse the package, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Return to sender, refuse, and when it gets back,\n\nSpeaker 1: they'll release it in a couple days.\n\nSpeaker 2: I already started that back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me give you my name and my number\n\nSpeaker 2: as a reference, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is K.T. Goodrich, Pat.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my direct extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't get passed around and talk to other people\n\nSpeaker 2: and have to restart it,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you'll be exhausted to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just rest assured that this is a process,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'll get you back your money,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I already started the credit process back.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it should take about 24 hours\n\nSpeaker 2: to three to five business days at worst, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: In light of everything,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, but in light of everything, sir, too,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you're definitely not calling Valenzuela,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm so sorry it didn't work out.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I meant, what I would notice in your chart,\n\nSpeaker 2: there was questions that were sent to you\n\nSpeaker 1: that weren't answered, and it was something like this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you ever experienced hardness or erection\n\nSpeaker 1: within the last, like when you take the Viagra 50s,\n\nSpeaker 2: have you ever experienced hardness or erection\n\nSpeaker 1: within 30 to 60 minutes?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then a second question that was asked was,\n\nSpeaker 1: have you ever experienced erection or hardness\n\nSpeaker 2: within four to six hours?\n\nSpeaker 1: And why are you asking me this question?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you said it didn't work, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, honestly, you know, honestly,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's not, you're not a clinician,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's not for you to be asking anyway, so it's a-\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I could ask that as a person,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you came to us because you had a challenge,\n\nSpeaker 2: you had an obstacle that you experienced,\n\nSpeaker 1: you needed help, and this didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: And these messages were sent to you on the chat,\n\nSpeaker 1: on the chat between the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it says, have you experienced\n\nSpeaker 1: any adverse side effects, or other than hardness\n\nSpeaker 2: within a 24-hour period?\n\nSpeaker 1: So based on that, we're crediting you your account,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm starting that now, and then,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you already spent 63.95 in December,\n\nSpeaker 2: which I cannot refund that, because it's past 30 days,\n\nSpeaker 1: what I am gonna do is I'm gonna send you 10\n\nSpeaker 2: to replace that with something better and stronger,\n\nSpeaker 1: that way it can make you whole, and there's no malice, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's free, it's not gonna cost you anything,\n\nSpeaker 1: there's no obligation, I just don't want\n\nSpeaker 2: everything I worked for, these guys, I'm a veteran,\n\nSpeaker 1: and these guys gave me a good opportunity\n\nSpeaker 2: that even Chinese companies won't give me.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are Americans here, I'm American,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you know, I've done a lot for my country, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know about you, and I don't judge you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I've done a lot, I am 18 Bravo,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm gonna do what's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have my number, I'm doing what's right for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I pledge a flag, and I'll take care of you,\n\nSpeaker 2: just trust and rest assured that,\n\nSpeaker 1: well, I'm not running from this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm here to take care of you, all right, Pat?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all whole here, call me back on Monday or Tuesday\n\nSpeaker 2: when you return to sender that product,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the pharmacy will release the funds,\n\nSpeaker 2: but at least I got in front of it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're getting back that 4029,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then for the 1216 that didn't work,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sending you 10 pills that something I know will work,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I've seen a lot of crap,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I don't wish what I've seen\n\nSpeaker 2: or what I've done myself on anyone.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't care how hard you are, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all, sir, so peace be with you, all right, Pat?\n\nSpeaker 1: I gotta go, man, adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Pat, your last name.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're in California, you're in California, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it doesn't matter, I'm a marijuana merchant,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I am in California, why?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why, how do you wanna know?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all right, I'm not gonna test your hardness or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but you know what you can test it,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I'm born and raised in Dallas, Fort Worth,\n\nSpeaker 2: and my family's from Tennessee, and you're in Georgia,\n\nSpeaker 1: so what have you done for our country?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, man, you know what, as you said, I gotta go,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I wanted to make sure that you did,\n\nSpeaker 2: the whole purpose of my call was to make sure\n\nSpeaker 1: that you did issue the credit for the chart\n\nSpeaker 2: that y'all erroneously put on my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not erroneous, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: What it is, there's terms and conditions\n\nSpeaker 1: that you probably didn't read,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then when the doctor ordered the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: to send you refills, they did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: People don't read anymore, that's,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, they don't take personal response,\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's very true, because y'all didn't read my email\n\nSpeaker 2: that I sent, and I asked you very clearly not to refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you did anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we can go back and forth, bud,\n\nSpeaker 1: but this all started with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So with you, you don't read the terms and conditions\n\nSpeaker 1: that said you opt in to receive a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did offer to, you did issue the credit, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I started the credit process on contingent\n\nSpeaker 2: that you return the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when you do that, they'll release the funds,\n\nSpeaker 2: and to make you whole, we're sending you\n\nSpeaker 1: or replacing you for the 12-16,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I paused your prescription and I elevated you,\n\nSpeaker 1: that way it can expedite everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you have a change of heart and stance,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I did right by you, Pat,\n\nSpeaker 2: when you see that this works that I sent you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you'll change your heart, you'll come around.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, and you know that we're good, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know we're good,\n\nSpeaker 2: because people are all bent out nowadays.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're projecting, so I have respect for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get erroneous charges on your card,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna go ahead when the time occurs,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna send it back, but I'm also going to go\n\nSpeaker 1: to my credit card company, I already talked to them today\n\nSpeaker 2: before I called you, and I'm gonna ask them\n\nSpeaker 1: to release the charge, and they're gonna tell you\n\nSpeaker 2: exactly what I said, because they tell you to call us\n\nSpeaker 1: to take care of it, then I told you that I started it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So these are two things, and you know from history,\n\nSpeaker 1: when you dispute a charge, it takes longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they just investigate it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we're gonna tell them that, yeah, KT Goodrich,\n\nSpeaker 2: he did start the credit process on contingent\n\nSpeaker 1: that he refused a return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then they're gonna drag it along.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's a lot faster to just deal with us,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's why they sent you to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you started with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna send it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just send it back, I already,\n\nSpeaker 2: Pat, I started the credit process,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm also sending you a replacement\n\nSpeaker 2: for the original stuff, and I'm making you all work good.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I wish you nothing but good all day,\n\nSpeaker 1: whether you tease the blue states or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're all one, people forget that,\n\nSpeaker 1: I still pledge allegiance, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish you well, Pat, and God bless you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mark 11, 24, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Be good, be well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Godspeed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
