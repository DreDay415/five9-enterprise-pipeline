    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I purchased an order from you a while ago and I didn't know it was going to automatically\n\nSpeaker 1: regenerate more, you know, so I just got notified by an email that you're going to be sending\n\nSpeaker 2: me more, but I would like to cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, David. I can help you out. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: June 1, 1965.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer. Give me one second. I can cancel\n\nSpeaker 2: that refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. I was able to cancel that out, so you'll be seeing $163.95 back on your credit\n\nSpeaker 1: card in about five business days or less. David, how's the medication working out for\n\nSpeaker 2: you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't really use it that much, for one thing, and like I said in my text message or email\n\nSpeaker 2: too, I said if and when I want it again, I'll just, you know, go through the proper\n\nSpeaker 1: or whatever to get another order coming to me, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Yeah, so with your VIP status, yeah, you just have to call in. With your VIP status,\n\nSpeaker 1: what a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause the refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in when you need\n\nSpeaker 1: a refill. I could pause that for you until July 31, 2026, and see if you don't need a\n\nSpeaker 2: refill by then. You just give us a call and pause it further. That way it keeps you locked\n\nSpeaker 1: in to your rate, because I heard rates are going to go up in a few months, but once you're\n\nSpeaker 2: locked in, yours don't ever go up. Yours don't increase.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll kind of have to watch it like six months from now, and if I don't want it then\n\nSpeaker 2: –\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just set yourself a reminder. If you don't want it, just call us like a day before\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you could pause it again for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I guess I can roll with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Give me one second. All right, perfect. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Perfect, David. Yeah, so if you don't need a refill, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just put a little note in your – yeah, I wish they emailed to remind, but they don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Was there any way that you could set it up that it doesn't automatically come out\n\nSpeaker 1: in six months? You know, that I would have to call to initiate it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that would cancel out your – if I did that, it would cancel your profile. It\n\nSpeaker 1: would completely delete your profile, and then you would not be able to get refills\n\nSpeaker 2: in the future, and then if prices went up, you'd have to pay the higher price. But now\n\nSpeaker 1: you're locked in.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I guess we'll just roll with that. I'll have to keep an eye on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Sounds good. So you'll be seeing that 163 back on your card in about\n\nSpeaker 2: five business days or less, and it pauses –\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: – until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You as well. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye.",
