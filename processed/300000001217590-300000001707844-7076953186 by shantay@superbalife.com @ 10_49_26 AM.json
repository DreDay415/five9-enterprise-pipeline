    "text": "Speaker 1: So thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I ordered an order back in January, early part of January, end of December.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I only ordered one prescription. And I just got a notice from PayPal\n\nSpeaker 2: that they charged my account for another prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't order a monthly deal. I was going to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had called and sent an email that I was not happy with the product\n\nSpeaker 1: and it wasn't as advertised. And they said to go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I wrote again. And anyway, so I'd like to cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's already been charged to my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I have your name as well as your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: John Stolp, S-T-O-L-P, 2-25-1949.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I do see that you have a prescription with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how our program works is that the prescription does come with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And for 10 pills it's set for every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why you were charged for another refill,\n\nSpeaker 2: which you have one on the way to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I just need to cancel everything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I would like to – you mentioned that they're not working for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they're not. They're not. They weren't as advertised.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it looks like on my end that what you're getting is our generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you looking to get the AGB?\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered that particular one. Yes, I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because it looks like –\n\nSpeaker 1: If you look – I had sent an email back about that it was not as I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the reply was, well, it's not going to look exactly like it was on the website,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's what you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the bottle in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because there's two ways we can identify if this is correct or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you can look on the label, the actual label of the pill bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to be towards the far right of the label, kind of towards the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have the word identification.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you read me what that says?\n\nSpeaker 2: For AGB, it should say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says verified by AAF written by blah, blah, blah,\n\nSpeaker 2: fulfilled by GoGoMed's identification, AC340, Apco Pharma.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that is our regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I could do, John, is have the pharmacy send you a replacement order\n\nSpeaker 2: to replace what you got, the first ten pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then let us know how that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if that does not work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: then we could give you the refund for the second order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if it does work for you, then we'll replace the second order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: See, when I called about it, they told me I got what I got,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that's what I paid for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so that was not happy with that particular.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry that you were misinformed if someone did tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's why I like to go over the pill bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: because at a first glance, it kind of does look like the same pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I don't know who you spoke with,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they should have kind of did a little bit more investigation.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the best way to rectify\n\nSpeaker 2: or see what you got is by letting you read the identification on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to go back here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I had talked to somebody,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they said it doesn't look like it was in the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: They said, well, they all look alike.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: The shaping of the AGV is going to be more of a profound diamond shape.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you received, it kind of looks like a diamond shape,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's more like kind of roundish, kind of ovalish.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then also the markings on the pill is also different.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think the markings on the pill that you received,\n\nSpeaker 2: it will say AC388 or 98.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, right, because you have the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yes, AC340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, the AGV is going to be a white diamond shaped pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's going to have 100 on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to put this in for the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 1: to send you a replacement order to replace the first 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give us a call back after you try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let us know how that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it did not work, we will refund you for the second order.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it does work, we're going to replace the second order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll get that in the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, so this first order then is just, yeah, it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's one on the way to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second order is on the way to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can dispose those.\n\nSpeaker 2: If the AGV that I'm sending you works,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're going to replace the second order.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it does not work, then we're just going to, you know, refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm obviously not going to talk to you again when I call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, I can give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll call the same number and you'll just dial my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which is?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is 0021.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Chante.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's spelled S-H-A-N-T-A-Y.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Chante.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's my pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: You enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
