    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and—\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Teddy Smith.\n\nSpeaker 2: Teddy Smith? T-E-D-D-Y?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a moment, Mr. Smith. Yeah, your name looks a little messed up here. It says P-D-A-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here we go. Teddy Daniel Smith. All right. Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ma'am?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Three-six-three-four-five.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you at 109 Holman in Headlands, Alabama?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So you're calling about your prescription. Did you need to change the frequency or did—\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to try some different pills? What can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to cancel it. Cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can do that. Are you looking to cancel it just because you don't want to get any—\n\nSpeaker 1: More for now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can switch it to on-demand so that way you're not, you know, stockpiled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I just want to cancel it for now and I'll call back if I, you know, need more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Here's a suggestion for you to keep your prescription active because you do need—\n\nSpeaker 2: To have the prescription active to actually place orders down the line, right? I can switch—\n\nSpeaker 1: It to on-demand so that way you don't get charged anything. You don't get anything monthly—\n\nSpeaker 2: Or every two months. Just order whenever you feel like it. Okay? So you can call in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to cancel it all for right now. That's all I want to do, just cancel it all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. When we cancel it for right now, and I know you're trying to shoot me—\n\nSpeaker 2: Off the phone so you can cancel it, I need to tell you exactly what to do because what—\n\nSpeaker 1: Happens is people call back and they're upset when they can't place orders. Okay? So this—\n\nSpeaker 2: Is full disclosure. Once we cancel it, you can't re-up the prescription. As long as you're—\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay with that, then we're fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So yeah, you can't place an order in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.",
