    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi. My name is Raymond Neel. I ordered the ABC or whatever that is called.\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered that over two weeks ago. Yeah, well over two weeks ago. I haven't received anything. I wanted to know what was going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Raymond. I can help you out. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-25-49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Okay, it looks like the pharmacy had it. It was too soon to fill, so they had it on hold until today.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me message the pharmacy and tell them to ship it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pharmacy hasn't shipped it yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it was on hold. I think, I don't know why it was on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can order it tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you figure it out?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, order it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, too soon to fill. Hold order until January 26th.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's a controlled substance, so it's regulated by the state.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I guess you can't get so many within a certain quantity, you know, a certain amount of time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: So maybe if you're getting other ED medication from somewhere else, because you know the pharmacy has like, they have your whole record.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe they saw something else in there and that's why they put it on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: But today's the 26th, so I'm going to message them to ship it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long will it take for them to get it to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll ship it out to you tomorrow morning. It ships from Kentucky, so you should get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I promise.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was told when I ordered it, that I would have it in five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: When we place the order, we don't see the pharmacy notes until they update the profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it doesn't notify us unless, you know, you call in and it's like, where the hell is my order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Then it's like, oh, okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: See you tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get a confirmation to that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, hang on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is 5B as in boy, 428375C as in cat, 2.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you repeat that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 5B428375C, 2.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can track the order with that number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the pharmacy will email you a tracking number tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good now.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
