I have a cold now after all this harsh weather.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have been getting the True Blue here for the last couple of months.\n\nSpeaker 2: True Blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait, hold on. What is this called?\n\nSpeaker 2: Score Blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Score Blue. True Blue. I think that's an old cartoon or something from when I was younger.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, gosh, I have too many of them. Is there any way to pause this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can. We can give you anywhere from four or five months on pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, go ahead and do that, like five months. It's been a little bit slow recently.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no worries. I'll take care of that for you now, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. My name is James Ellis, E-L-L-I-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got you pulled up already and I just took care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Was there anything else you needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. No, that's great. I mean, they definitely do work.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, like I said, I just need to go through not such a dry spell.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I hope you do get that figured out as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, sir. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care. Bye-bye.",
