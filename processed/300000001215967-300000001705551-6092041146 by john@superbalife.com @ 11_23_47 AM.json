I ordered some prosthogenics, I don't know, a week or so ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I kind of miscalculated when I ordered it. And I'm going to run out like really soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: It really does help me a lot. So I was very curious about if you had any idea when I'll actually receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Give me a moment to pull up your account, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okie dokie. Central Ave. in Ocean City?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me check the tracking. You know, it's funny. I've talked to multiple people the last couple of weeks that live in Ocean City year-round.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. My grandparents used to have a house down there because they're from Pennsylvania.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've been to Ocean City a million times, but obviously I know how those short towns go.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a small world, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it is. Okay. Yes. I do see when it's going to arrive. It's going to arrive Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know you ordered it on the 18th, but Monday is the day for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's all I needed. I'm just making sure I didn't screw up the order or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. You absolutely did not. Everything went as it should have. Let me just see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's because the 18th was a Sunday. That makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, we couldn't ship it out at least until the 19th, so it probably just took a day or so to ship. That's why.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So it'll be here on the…\n\nSpeaker 1: It says expected by Monday at 9 – by 9 p.m. on Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I guess there's a chance it could show up tomorrow, but by Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
