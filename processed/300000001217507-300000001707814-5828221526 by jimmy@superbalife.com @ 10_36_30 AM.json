This is Jimmy from Viagra, School of Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I know you hung up, but I didn't get a chance to explain to you the options of what we're going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to go ahead and, like I said, again, your ownership hasn't been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will not get any more, and they're also refunding you the charge that just occurred.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, again, other than your yelling, I could explain that to you, but you decided to yell and hang up.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have any questions, it's been taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can take a look at your account, your credit card account, within the next three or four days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should see the credit. Thank you very much, and you have a wonderful day. Bye-bye.",
