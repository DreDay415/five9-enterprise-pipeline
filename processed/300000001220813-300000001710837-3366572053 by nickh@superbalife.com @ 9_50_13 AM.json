    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. My name is Jason Evans, and I have been subscribed to this for a while, and I had actually changed my prescription from the generic Cialis to the Viagra, and that's what it shows on my account, but I'm still receiving Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me take a look here and see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perhaps there's a duplicate account or something like that. Let's get to the bottom of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: So first, can I get your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's January 24th, 1975.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said you've received AGV from us?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is that? What are you saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you moved over to the Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's the generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, AGV is authorized from Pfizer. It is different than general generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I'm just checking here because sometimes what can happen is someone creates a second account\n\nSpeaker 2: in order for them to get the AGV or generic Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and there could be two accounts running at the same time with different information.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at your script right now, and I mean, you have been a patient of ours since 2023.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have VIP status, but all I see here is I've seen a prescription for Cialis\n\nSpeaker 2: that's been active since January of 2025.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see any recent prescriptions for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I have tried to – I changed it a while back,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it still shows when I go to my account and click on prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: It shows the Viagra. It doesn't show Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me look at your dashboard right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're right. That's interesting. I'm looking at your dashboard right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Super interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so to be honest, I've just been taking it in the mouth of the Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: because you take it differently,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's not been effective the past few times, and I thought, what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: But then two hours, three hours later, I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's been a little bit disheartening, to be honest.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah. I'm going to get this fixed for you, and I'll make sure we make this right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've been a patient here for a while, and I'm sorry our website is so –\n\nSpeaker 2: you're having issues with it here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you're right. I'm looking at here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It shows your prescription is for the Viagra for 25 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: and yet online, they're sending you this.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm just – I want to double check here to see if there's any way you could have a second account.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're saying – but you've never received the Viagra yet since switching it, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, never.\n\nSpeaker 2: Never, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's been quite a while since I switched it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. When did you switch it here, Jason?\n\nSpeaker 1: I honestly don't remember. It was probably last year sometime.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So –\n\nSpeaker 2: This is what I'm going to do to make it up for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to physically, on my end, change your prescription to the Viagra, the generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm also going to get you locked in at a special holiday rate that we were running, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So this is going to be 10 pills for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's going to be a little bit cheaper than what you were paying for your last prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So my last prescription was $40 a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. So the Cialis I see here is $74.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, it only turned into $40, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because, yeah, I see here $74.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's –\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I think it's like $10 a pill or something like that, so it was, you know –\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, so $40 – I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, $40 is what you were paying back in 2023.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, no, the past year it's been $74.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, because the $40, that was years ago. That was three years ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, right now, like I said, you've been paying for four pills, $74.95 of the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do is get you on 10 of the Viagra for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you can be locked in at that price.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I'm going to do, though, for you is I'm going to send you 10 for free right now\n\nSpeaker 2: to make up for the inconvenience here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can expect a bottle of 10 Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And these are going to be 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can either break them in half, take them as is.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligrams usually is equivalent to 20 milligrams of Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then any future orders will be actively on the Viagra, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So will this take place on my next billing cycle?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that how that works?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you the replacement right now, but your next billing cycle,\n\nSpeaker 2: so a month from now, that's when the new order would go through for the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: unless you want to start.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get this handled for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That has been adjusted, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I sure appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, yeah, and I'm sorry this was happening for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm glad we took care of it finally for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, it was just one of those things that I finally today, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: after, well, to be honest, I mean, not to be too, you know, personal,\n\nSpeaker 1: but, you know, last night I issued, like, for the fourth or fifth time,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm like, well, maybe it just don't work anymore,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm going to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just went through my account to make sure everything was up to snuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I realized, you know, I'm not getting what I say I'm supposed to.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I've never, yeah, I've never double checked behind it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just get it and put it in the cabinet.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's kind of been where I'm.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so, like, I'm prematurely going in for the pack,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I've got another hour to go before I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: So anyway, yeah, no, but I appreciate you taking care of me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're all set, and if you ever, you know, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: have any questions or you want to make adjustments,\n\nSpeaker 2: please don't hesitate to call us as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I know the website can be a little bit, you know, buggy,\n\nSpeaker 2: so we'd be happy to, you know, handle it for you all directly over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
