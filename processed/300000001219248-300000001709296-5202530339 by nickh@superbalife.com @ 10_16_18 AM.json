    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at Scorblue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I tried this product and it just didn't work at all. It wanted to work but it never lasted more than it just didn't last. They also, I know that it says on the paperwork here that the authorized genetic, what is that called, instead of the actual Viagra it's genetic, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you're talking about the AGV in particular, correct? We sell multiple things here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the AGV is authorized generic Viagra from Pfizer. What that means is it's the exact same drug as the brand name version but sold without the brand name on the label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this allows them to do it at home.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, hold on one second. Come here, Jeff. Jeff, hold on one second, okay? I got to go back to the phone. One second, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be outside.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's over.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway,\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, it'd be better, it'd be easier for me, could I pull up your account and your prescription and I can see, so I can just kind of see how it's organized against your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, give me 20 seconds, I'll say something to the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Jeff, just go, I'm going to be a while. I'm going to be a half hour on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sorry about that. Yeah, I have whatever numbers you want. I have the EES number or the verification code number, which do you want?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can give me any information on that bottle in your hand and I'll be able to pull up your account. So, I could take your full name and date of birth as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Alvin Levine and the date of birth is 11-25-1946.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Yeah, Mr. Levine, I'm looking for the description here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you the Rx number. It's 9951485. That'll probably pull it right up.\n\nSpeaker 1: See, on the advertisement thing that I saw was telling me I was going to get, because I tried generic Viagra or whatever that is, Synthadol or I don't know, and nothing seems to work. But this here one said the AGV was 1,700 times, 170 times more powerful than this and that, and it was a blue pill and the AGV was supposed to be printed on the blue pill, and I got a white pill with nothing on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the label says, but it's...\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's what I want to, I just want to, let's just, I just want to review what you received, what you two expect, and I think where some of the confusion happened here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, first to begin, I think you, so I look at the prescription and you did in fact receive the 100 mg Viagra AGV. There's a few signs that you can tell it's the AGV. On the bottom side of the bottle, you'll see Greenstone LLC. That is the Pfizer Laboratories in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, if your bottle should have that in the bottom right of the white label.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And on the...\n\nSpeaker 1: This says white diamond tablet. Is that where I'm looking? Greenstone LLC?\n\nSpeaker 2: There you go, exactly. So, Greenstone is Pfizer's laboratory in France. So, that's how you...\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you were making this stuff in the United States.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir. The AGV is the highest of quality and it's made in France. Pfizer is a French-based company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Co-Pharma is a generic out of the United States. Now, with the medications in France, they do have higher quality standards and that's what makes this one particularly different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I think where some of the mistakes happened is with our marketing material.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here at Score Blue, we sell AGV and we sell regular name brand Viagra and we sell the generic Viagra, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, on our advertisements, you might see a blue pill, but that's the original Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: The white diamond-shaped pill is the AGV. Now, they don't say AGV on them because they got rid of the food coloring on the stamp. So, your pill should say 100 on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: They do. They do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, that is your receipt. Now, I'm more concerned about the effectiveness for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, so, it is potent and, you know, I'm looking at your health survey and I see here that you've taken Cialis in the past and you said they first worked, but, you know, slowly they get weaker, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was one time and then the next times they didn't do anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh. Now...\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, maybe a little, but obviously not enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And now, on the health survey as well, I do see here you noted that you aren't taking any prescription medications. Is that still the case?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I take some medications, but nothing that would...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was a firefighter paramedic for 24 years in New York City and I make sure that nothing I'm taking is contraindicated with anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That's fine, but I want to let you know here on the health survey that you provided us, you stated that you were not taking any medications.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, at that time I wasn't, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't taking any medication when I bought the product. I am taking Percocet now for pain.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Sure. Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Percocet is not really contraindicated with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. No, but it can affect blood pressure and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, are you still taking...\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I have my own blood pressure monitor...\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: ...and my blood pressure is generally 128 over 78.\n\nSpeaker 1: Listen, I'm just explaining what...\n\nSpeaker 2: I know. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: ...a Viagra is safe for you to take. I'm just explaining what could affect the results of the Viagra, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you still taking the Alpha-1 Adrenergic Blocker, the Prazososin Hydrochloride as well?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You noted on here that you were taking Prazososin Hydrochloride Mini Press.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't tell you that. I don't even know what that is.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is just what I'm looking on your health survey. So...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'm sorry, sir. Somebody made a mistake and it's no big deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I've never had that issue, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: For a 79-year-old guy, I'm really healthy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So you're not taking an Alpha Blocker?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I might need an Alpha Blocker. I was getting chest pains. That's why I stopped trying it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What happened the first time I tried it...\n\nSpeaker 2: Alpha Blockers are traditionally used for PTSD or for dizziness, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I'm just double-checking on your health stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: which could be conflicting with the results of what you're expecting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, Mr. Levine, given that your prescription here has gone through, and you just got it this month, can I ask, did you take it with food?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or did you take it on an empty stomach?\n\nSpeaker 2: I always take medicine with food.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, herein lies the issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you notice on the directions with the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: it does specifically say to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is a major factor in the effectiveness of medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait a minute. Where does it say that, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Where does it say that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It says it on the label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, take one tablet by mouth, you know, before sex,\n\nSpeaker 1: and neither do not take more than one dose in 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the original paperwork that came with it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, it says, it says, the dental fill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is the leading ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the leading ingredient.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the HEV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Generic for Viagra, take one tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: The paperwork that came with it, it says, go-go meds on the top.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a white sheet that says, uses, how to use.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I got this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You look at the directions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it says there, on there, it says, take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I didn't, I got to be honest with you,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I had taken Sinanadil or whatever the other one is,\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't even remember their names.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't going to read all this.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like when you go buy a new car.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to spend three months out in the frickin' lobby.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Going through all the legal stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not even, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Legal stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't read it all.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't read it all because I had, I knew what I was taking,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I knew I wasn't taking anything contraindicated to that drug.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, but Alvin, any doctor will tell you to take the medication on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any type of Sidenafil or Cadalafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, if I would recommend here, for better results,\n\nSpeaker 1: maybe try to take it on an empty stomach next time you're planning on being intimate\n\nSpeaker 2: and seeing how the results factor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me ask you a question.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to take these anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had severe chest pains.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought I was having an MI.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what an MI is?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but the fact that you weren't taking it as directed could definitely be a factor there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't taking it as directed, so that's why I'm not going to be able to get my money back, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no, we can.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to see if we can get these to work for you, Alvin.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't want to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just saying you didn't take it as directed,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you've got some side effects and you didn't see the results you're seeing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm saying if we can get you to take it as directed, you know, and it works for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: that would be the best-case scenario, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it would be.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, I would have to take it again to find out.\n\nSpeaker 1: And after having the pains I had, I almost went to the hospital, to the ER.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the pains were long and they were severe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why would I?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Levine, well, what I'm assuming here then is the milligram dosage might be a little high.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I recommend doing is taking 50 milligrams, cutting it in half,\n\nSpeaker 1: and take it on an empty stomach and see if that helps with the erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I could do that, but I think it's wasting your time and mine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, my job here is to help you in trying to get the medication to work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't want to waste your time either,\n\nSpeaker 2: so we can go any direction you want with this, but I'm just trying to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, and I appreciate that. I really am.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was the doctor's name that told my prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have that information?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So this was Dr.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did the doctor speak to me or did a nurse speak to me about when I ordered the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you ordered this, you did a health survey online.\n\nSpeaker 1: That health survey was then submitted to one of our doctors who's certified in your state of Arizona.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pulling up the doctor information right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in other words, the doctor didn't give you a prescription without talking to the patient and explaining what it is?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if somebody would have explained it, I'm just saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pull me out. My father was, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your name? I forgot.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm Al.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not trying to frustrate you, Nick. It's just frustrating to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I would love an answer. I would.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, Al, I'm looking at all this.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the telehealth service in which this is, everything's done digitally.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the doctor sent you a message to your cell phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. That's the number ending in 0339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. I have that information.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Outlining.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, do not take one overdose for 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do not use this in combination with illegal drugs, with the side effects and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's directly from the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you mention that, you know, a doctor didn't speak with you, you could have responded to that message.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that allows you to talk to the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor is writing you this prescription with the health survey that you provided.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's why I just kind of like to reiterate on the health survey,\n\nSpeaker 2: because it is a very vital part with telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, to tell you the truth, I do want to try it again,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I got a couple of guidelines besides an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: What type of meds am I not supposed to take?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm only taking Percocet right now, and that's not even one a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's definitely fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: The biggest thing is nitric boosters, anything that affects oxygen in the blood.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're not taking anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I would recommend here is, you know, cut one in half.\n\nSpeaker 1: Next time you're planning on being intimate, take half of one on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: See if you have better results there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't think you'll have the side effects that you had.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes as potent as it can be, it can cause those things.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just because it's stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: But try taking half on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me ask you a question, Nick. Was it Nick?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, no, I forget stuff sometimes because I'm 79.\n\nSpeaker 1: It happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: At least I tell my wife I forget.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, can I call you back on your extension, like, whatever,\n\nSpeaker 2: in, say, a week or so and tell you how I'm doing or how it's working out?\n\nSpeaker 1: You sure can, and I would prefer that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So then we can, yeah, so I can help you out further.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the number 424-238-3054, that's a generic number for the company.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there a number I can get right to you with or no?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'd rather give you a direct phone number and not that phone number\n\nSpeaker 2: so then you can use my extension and get in contact with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's what I'd love to do, Nick. Where are you guys located?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm based out of Los Angeles, California.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy, the telehealth pharmacy is based out of Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm in New York.\n\nSpeaker 1: What part of LA, I mean, what part of California are you in?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm in Los Angeles. I live in Marina Del Rey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah, you guys got all Dodgers, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the deal with that?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I was raised a Cubs fan, so, you know, don't get me started on the Dodgers.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I got news for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Cubs stadium is my favorite in the National League.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't remember it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw also a, what was it called, a really beautiful park where the Baltimore Orioles play.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went to an American League game there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I went to the Yankees once, but, man, I'm a National League guy.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, the Giants, I was a New York Giants fan when I was a kid,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then they jumped up and left, and the Dodgers left, flipping bums, we called them,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, they pissed me off.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I took up with the Mets a couple of years later in 62,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I was mad at all the damn sports people.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it's our team.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's like getting up Christmas morning,\n\nSpeaker 1: and when you're all excited, you know, with your siblings,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're all jumping and yelling, and you went up there\n\nSpeaker 1: and you tried to look in the mirror, didn't put the presents out yet,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you went back to sleep.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got up, you woke up, and they were there saying,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, you're messing with your stuff, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you remember any of that stuff happening in your life?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, unfortunately not, but I recall.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know about it for sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: What my wife and I did, we did because it's old school.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was 49 when my youngest daughter was born.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was married once before, and that was for lust, not love,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, people make mistakes.\n\nSpeaker 1: You get the wrong partner, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the way it is, but you move on,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I moved on to the greatest person for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife is great, but my kids,\n\nSpeaker 1: I've talked so much about them already.\n\nSpeaker 2: What were we just saying about?\n\nSpeaker 1: What were we just talking about?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have any remembering?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was about to give you the phone number so you could call me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, let's say that'll work better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, something about my kids I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, Christmas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, Christmas, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Real quick, Nick, and that could be a tongue twister.\n\nSpeaker 1: Real quick, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, what we used to do was we didn't put up a Christmas tree.\n\nSpeaker 1: My mother was Catholic, not Catholic, Christian,\n\nSpeaker 2: and my father was Jewish,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I didn't really get brought up with anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, we used to have a Christmas tree,\n\nSpeaker 1: and what my dad used to do was what we did to our children.\n\nSpeaker 2: We didn't put up the Christmas tree.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some people put it up like two weeks before Christmas,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they put presents and everything all underneath.\n\nSpeaker 1: My kids would go to everybody's house and say,\n\nSpeaker 2: oh, look at this, we don't even have a Christmas tree.\n\nSpeaker 1: When they woke up Christmas morning, there was a tree.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even though there were girls,\n\nSpeaker 1: there was a train going around the base of the tree in circles,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they had probably 15, you know, I have two daughters,\n\nSpeaker 1: so actually three, one on the first marriage.\n\nSpeaker 2: They would wake up in the morning and it was like a fairyland,\n\nSpeaker 1: or like a dream, you know, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the greatest thing in the world for kids.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Nick, give me your number before you hang up on me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Phone number is 800-700-4197.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4197. You have an extension?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. Extension is 0042.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll run it back. 800-700-4197-0042.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Nick, I know I'm a pain in the ass. I'm sorry, bro.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get frustrated, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm also a Vietnam vet, so I have certain issues that I, you know, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: I deal with stuff in different ways than people, most people.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm not nasty.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would never put my hands on my wife.\n\nSpeaker 1: If somebody puts my hands on my wife, I got to go to jail, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't care what your preferences are.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's your family, it doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't matter. If it's your family, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do what you got to do to take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I, anyway, I don't want to take up another hour and a half.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure there's people waiting for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nick, thank you very much. I thought, you know, we could do.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just remember, take half an empty stomach and see how that is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure you drink plenty of water.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I wrote that down.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything you told me, yeah, everything you told me, I wrote down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks, Nick. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
