I ordered the AVG Viagra, and y'all did not send me AVG Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your date of birth, Mr. Bush?\n\nSpeaker 2: 11-02-1965.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what? I see you called this morning, Mr. Bush, and spoke to another agent,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it looks like he's taking care of you already.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's gonna reship you another order, and he sent it priority mail for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll see that go out, and it'll go out and get there quickly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, um, am I supposed to get a tracking number, or...?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, won't have it yet, though. Actually, it might be there already.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll have to...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you'll have to, um, wait until I reach out to the pharmacy and get that from them.\n\nSpeaker 1: They don't populate automatically. We have to, like, manually ask them for it, so it'll take a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I'll have it by Monday morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, no problem. Just look out Monday morning, and you'll see that email, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.",
