This number didn't pull up an account.\n\nSpeaker 1: It might be 304-290-4616.\n\nSpeaker 2: 290-4616?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: 304, oh it changed it back, sorry, 290 and 1696?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, 4616.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4616, I do apologize for that. Here we are. Okay sir, sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have your account pulled up here. I see that you're a VIP status customer and how can I assist you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I do see your most recent order here and what was the reason for the cancellation?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just, I don't like the product and it's not working that well anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not working? Okay. What I wanted to, because I see that you're a VIP status customer of ours and you've been with us since 2022.\n\nSpeaker 1: So since you're a VIP sir, what I can send you as a courtesy at absolutely no cost is our new AGV Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you've heard of it. It's been in high demand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's been the big rave as Pfizer Pharmaceuticals has modified and improved their Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV has been modified to have fewer to no side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: It also just works faster and lasts longer so it's more effective.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want me to send you a sample of 10 of them to try?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, they're FDA approved. Like I said, they're in high demand. Our customers love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know you've been taking Cialis for a while so sometimes when you've been taking the medication for a long time,\n\nSpeaker 2: it could, you know, not work as well because your body just gets used to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it might be worth trying the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: The difference with Viagra, I don't know if you've ever taken it before, you do want to take it on an empty stomach\n\nSpeaker 1: and you will take it like 30 minutes prior to intercourse.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll send you, it comes in three different milligrams, 25, 50 or 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: How many milligrams would you like?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, what do you recommend?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, have you ever taken it before?\n\nSpeaker 1: Years ago but I had side effects from it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's very common which is why the new AGV is so popular.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I would say start at 50 milligrams right there in between.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can always break it in half and start with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can also increase it to 100 milligrams to take two in a 24-hour period.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll get you a sample of 10 sent out to you today and I'll go ahead\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll put your account on a pause for six months until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you have plenty of time to determine how you want to set up your account going forward\n\nSpeaker 1: and see how you like the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir, for being a VIP status customer and I'm so excited for you to try out the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
