I had canceled that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me pull up your account, Marshall. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you just tell me your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1-7-50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I just pulled up tracking. That refill is going to be delivered to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't need it, don't open it up. Just write return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just write return to sender on the front.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pop it back in your mailbox. That way you don't have to pay for postage.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it already has a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then...\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I just put it back in the mailbox?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just write return to sender and put it back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And were you trying to order the AGV or did you order the generic on purpose?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I ordered it, but not this...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I didn't order it this time. The first time I did, I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did the doctor put you on monthly refills, which you do not need?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I see you ordered the generic Viagra and not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that what you wanted, the generic and not the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV is the latest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's what I had. I ordered the latest formula the first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you just...\n\nSpeaker 1: Remember the latest formula I had the first time?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, you ordered generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was supposed to be.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I didn't order the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to send you out a replacement free of charge\n\nSpeaker 2: to get you the correct AGV for your initial order.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what I can do is I'll go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it allows the pharmacy to push through your replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, you know, with your VIP status, a lot of people just like to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just put return to send and put it in the mailbox, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, gentlemen.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.",
