    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Lydia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Mitch Marks. I'm your ex.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Mitch. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a question first. I ordered the new Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your advertisement says, you know, you take it 11 minutes before and it lasts 14 hours, whatever the advertisement says.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when I got the pills on the bottle, it says, it doesn't say it's Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says it's Sidenafil and it says to take one hour before.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if I got the right stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I can definitely look into this for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your date of birth, Mitch?\n\nSpeaker 2: October 9, 1953.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 2 South Lakeshore Drive, Lake Worth, Florida, 33462?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. So do you have your pills with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can go look. I can get them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the other, I mean, this is another thing, but another thing, I need to put a hold on the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just charged me for another refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I've only used one of the first batch, and I'm having abdominal surgery this week,\n\nSpeaker 1: and so I probably won't even be able to have sex for about a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need all these pills, for one thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I've got the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you need the Rx number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I can see I've confirmed that you're Mitch Marks, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. So I'm looking at your profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So I don't need any other info.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So what do the pills say on them?\n\nSpeaker 2: It says Cidenafil Citrix 50-milligram tablet, generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take one or two tablets by mouth one hour before sex as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got the new Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do the pills say on them, the physical pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get one out.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does say AC339, AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you are correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here's what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to see with shipping, but I think we're in a good spot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm really crossing my fingers if we can just cancel and refund this refill for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did already message them, so they should get back to me soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: The trouble is maybe they get back to me in the next 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe it's three hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I will make sure to revisit and take care of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they have already sent it, I will just send you an e-mail with the instructions\n\nSpeaker 2: that we're about to talk about right here, right now, which is just, hey,\n\nSpeaker 1: like I understand you're having surgery.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you receive this, just write return to sender on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as long as you do not open the package, you can put it right back in your mailbox\n\nSpeaker 2: and they will bring it right back to us and we can refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't think that will be an issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think they will be able to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll see what I can do.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then regarding receiving the generic, I will send you out a replacement of the\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV right now on us because I do understand that you already paid for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we will make it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship this replacement to 2 South Lakeshore Drive, Lake Worth, Florida,\n\nSpeaker 2: 33462?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is going to be out to you probably in the next three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually I would say, you know, Wednesday or Thursday,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that winter storm is pretty crazy, so, you know, we'll see.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: especially because of that surgery, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can place your prescription on hold for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I can do up to six months just because six months is when the\n\nSpeaker 1: prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when is your surgery over?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like how long do you think your healing time will be?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, my surgery is this coming Thursday,\n\nSpeaker 1: and my paperwork says I shouldn't do anything strenuous for six weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you want to just leave it on hold until do you want to do June,\n\nSpeaker 1: do you want to do July, and then whenever you are ready,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can also call before then to order if you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, why don't we just put it on hold and then I'll call.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're going to send me the new one, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I wanted to try that out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and when I just got the regular Sidenafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need that because I have plenty of that already on hand.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just wanted to try the new one and see how it worked and go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I'll place it on hold for you for the full duration.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you need anything before the end of July, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're always at December Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the AGV will be on its way to you very soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I do have high hopes that they're going to be able to cancel your\n\nSpeaker 1: resale from yesterday, and then I'll just be able to refund you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if there's an issue, you'll get an email from me within the next 48 hours,\n\nSpeaker 1: but probably today at themichmarksataol.com,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it'll just say, hey, you're going to receive a product in, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: five, six days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just write, or even three to four days, just write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: leave it in the box, and as long as you don't open it,\n\nSpeaker 2: they'll just bring it back to us and it'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you, Mitch.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry for the trouble.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you do too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
