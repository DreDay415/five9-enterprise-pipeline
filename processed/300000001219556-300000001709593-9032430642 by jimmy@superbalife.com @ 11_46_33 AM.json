How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is Daniel Wilson, and I'd like to cancel my order of Philbenephile.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Wilson, let me go ahead and pull you up here, see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I was able to pull you up. I see that you are currently getting the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you're getting the AGV, which is a good one for your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: How you get them once every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going on? Is that too often for you? You want me to pause your subscription, or what's happening?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think I need it anymore, and I'll just do it as I need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, to keep your subscription active, we can pause your order so you're not getting them every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can postpone it for like five or six months, so therefore you keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, postpone it for, yeah, that'd be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll go and take care of that for you. I'm doing that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're looking at, I'll give you a date so you can look, and since you are a VIP.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that date come up too soon, all you have to do is just give us a call and say, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not ready for it yet, or if you like, you can order before then because your prescription will still be active.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're looking at June 17th.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as you know, like I said, you can call before then, or you can push it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's up to you, but that keeps you active for your prescription, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bet.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye.",
