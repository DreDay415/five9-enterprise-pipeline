    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, looking, what kind of a deal can you make me on a refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, give me just a second, let me see what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name, please, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Randall Davidson.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Davidson, it looks like...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you sent me an email...\n\nSpeaker 2: The order was placed here on the 28th, I'm not sure if you meant to place it, of this\n\nSpeaker 1: year.\n\nSpeaker 2: So 36 pills for $63.95, that was today, actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't finalize that order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it did go through, did you want it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, not at that price, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what price were you looking to get it for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think you gave me, if I'm not mistaken, on my first order, it was 50 pills for around\n\nSpeaker 2: $75?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was $88.95 for the 54 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want to do that again?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I could send you 18 more pills and charge you another $25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, what's, uh, what's your best deal on that?\n\nSpeaker 2: The biggest deal, 150 pills, it's like $1.49 plus the fee, it comes out to like $160, it's\n\nSpeaker 1: like dollar a pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it just depends how many you wanted to get, there's like, it's like a quantity\n\nSpeaker 2: thing and there's so many different quantities you can get because that's the smallest dose\n\nSpeaker 1: we offer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I really don't need that many on there, I'm just looking at something kind of in between,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you, uh, do you show us?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can take $10 off of this, if you wanted to do it for 36 pills, I can get it to you\n\nSpeaker 2: for $53.95 if that helps you, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, why don't we go ahead and do that, that would work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can take $10 off for you, Mr. Davidson, as a courtesy, not an issue at all, I can't\n\nSpeaker 1: guarantee that this is going to be something we can do all the time, but my name's Leo\n\nSpeaker 2: I helped you out today, it sounds like, you know, you just need a little bit of a break\n\nSpeaker 1: today, so I can assist you with that, um, since the order's already been placed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do, as a matter of fact, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: We all do out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it happens sometimes, I can definitely understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, I'll get you that $10 back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay, so, you're on the American Express card and the final charges will be, again?\n\nSpeaker 1: $53.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: $53.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: For $36?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me double check that, that may be a different Amex card from what you have on\n\nSpeaker 2: file, because I had somebody that tried to hack my account, so I had to get a different\n\nSpeaker 1: card on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's a, uh, it is a different expiration date on the card, as a matter of fact.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so that's no issue, um, the dot, or the bank, your financing company, will, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: know how to handle that, so even if it's like a new card, it'll go back into the same account,\n\nSpeaker 2: the card number so much doesn't matter, it'll go back to the same account it was pulled\n\nSpeaker 1: from.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll see that on the card.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it doesn't matter as to the expiration date on the card on there?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not in terms of like processing refunds back into it, you'll be fine, there's no issue\n\nSpeaker 1: there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because a lot of times, like, when people, like, commit fraud, they'll cancel the account\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the money will still go back into that same account, you know, they'll cancel\n\nSpeaker 2: that card out or what have you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's a similar process, so you'll be fine, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just look for that to come back in the next few days, Mr. Davidson, and then look\n\nSpeaker 2: for that order to come out in the next few days as well, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'll, I'll give an email on that then?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, um, no, not on this, you won't, you'll just see that money come back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, so just give it a few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That works then, so we'll have the money, well, you're going to go ahead and charge\n\nSpeaker 2: for the 36.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've already been charged for that and I gave you a little refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're good then.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that should be here in, what, about a week or so?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're good then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, so you're all set, Mr. Davidson, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye now.",
