    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. This is Derwood Lancaster. How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm well, Derwood. How are you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Doing pretty good, pretty good. I had sent you a letter to your company,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they had replied back from Erica.\n\nSpeaker 2: They had sent me a letter back and told me to give you guys a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what it is is unfortunately the Viagra program that you got, it's not working for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have to go with a peniline injection.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyhow, I told her, well, I told you guys last time I spoke to you about a month and a half ago\n\nSpeaker 2: that I needed to cancel out of the program.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I appreciate if I need to cancel out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the 24th of Saturday, I believe, yeah, Saturday,\n\nSpeaker 1: I was charged Saturday night for another prescription for the same stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I contacted her, and she told me to give you a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm trying to look at this letter.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's more or less says to cancel, to call you and tell you I need to cancel from the prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can notify the pharmacy to halt the doctor-authorized refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I do apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just because of HIPAA laws we do require to confirm identity.\n\nSpeaker 2: That being said, Mr. Lancaster, can you just confirm your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's March 7, 1959.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah, thanks for the calls here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see that most recent order went through on the 24th.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am able to cancel it because it has not been assigned a tracking number just yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'm going to do here is reach out to the pharmacy and then confirm that cancellation.\n\nSpeaker 2: That means, you know, so make sure they don't ship it out here today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Upon confirmation of that, I will be able to issue that refund of the $63.95, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that being said, you know, so I see that they sent you the AGV replacements, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's what you tried, and it was proven ineffective?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or were you sticking with the generic?\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't work at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: It don't work at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I notice that can be frustrating, especially when you're getting to the point where you have to do the injections.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I appreciate you guys' personality, and working with you guys has been really great.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's a product that unfortunately is not working for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, Mr. Lancaster, so like I said, I was able to put a cancellation request in there for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, the script in general, it does show here that you have about 10 more refills accessible to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted, you could put this on a pause, and then eventually when you did the penal injections,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you felt comfortable combining the two, that is always an option.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you could keep the prescription active and open in case you wanted to get refills of this later down the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate you saying that, but if I do change my mind, I'll just contact you again.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to cancel all the way, and I definitely want the automatic credit card payment to stop.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was kind of surprised because the credit card you had on file expired, but y'all somehow got my updated card.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know how that happened, but either way, I need that everything totaled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want no more automatic refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Peter?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just making notes here for the cancellation on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I went ahead and closed it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, the current prescription is officially closed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Refills aren't even accessible under this account anymore, so you will not receive any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, and if things get better, and I'd like to get back with you guys, I sure will give you a call,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I do appreciate y'all's attitude and everything about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Lancaster, that's all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, once I'm able to confirm with the pharmacy that's canceled, I'll be able to issue that refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And who am I talking to?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got something on my letter, kid.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to talk to you again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think Nick, you helped me out before.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nick, so did I.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you've got a great personality, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for helping me in this.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
