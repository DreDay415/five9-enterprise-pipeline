My name is Demetrius Woods.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a prescription with y'all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just checked my e-mail. I've been trying to call y'all.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ain't been getting no answer.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got a different credit card, so I want to change the credit card on my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Let me help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Demetrius. Demetrius, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Woods.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Woods. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-28-1971.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You want to do another quantity of 2,500 milligrams AGD?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I got an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: One point that came out on the first, I changed my credit card and everything, so it didn't go up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. They tried to send you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are we using the same card, the MasterCard?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no. That card is no good no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No problem. All right. I'm ready for the new number.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. 4-8-2-8-2-1. No, 2,100.\n\nSpeaker 2: 32-65-0670.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 2: 12-29.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three digits on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: 6-29. Okay. You said that for sending out Friday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is Friday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That did not go through. Let's try that card number again. Hold on. Let me get back to the screen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's the card number again?\n\nSpeaker 1: 4-8-2-8-2-1-0-0-3-2-6-5-0670.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-29.\n\nSpeaker 2: 12-29. And three digits on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6-29.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. That didn't go through. I think your bank might think it's fraud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you just have to call your bank and tell them you authorized the charge by ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. It might be because it's a Chime card. Y'all do Chime?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why. Okay. That's what I got, a Chime.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do I do?\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I ain't closing my account. I can just transfer my money. I can just transfer money over there on that card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's 113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. So set that up for Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Use that card. I can just transfer money over there so I can't use Chime.\n\nSpeaker 1: You actually just have to call us back on Friday. I can't set it to take out on a specific day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. So call back Friday?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Call back Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's our hours?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. We're Pacific Standard Time, so we open 8 to 5 our time.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's like 11 to 8 p.m. your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we're closed on the weekends. Yeah, we're closed on the weekends.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, and I'll call on the weekends, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. There you go. That's why. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. So I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Monday mornings are always super busy.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Friday. I'll call you Friday. I'm off Friday, so I'll call Friday morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Perfect. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too. Bye-bye.",
