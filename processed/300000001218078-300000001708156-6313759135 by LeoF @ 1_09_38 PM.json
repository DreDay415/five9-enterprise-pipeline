I only bought it one time.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Everton Muna.\n\nSpeaker 2: Check on this for you, Mr. Muna. See what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it looks like you got set up on our VIP prescription, Mr. Muna.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why they're sending the refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can pause this service for you if you needed time, if you wanted to place the orders manually online or over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way they won't be automatic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, how much am I being charged for each of these?\n\nSpeaker 2: So for those pills, it's $63.95 for the 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh man, I need a refund. I mean, if you don't want, you can send them back if you don't want to keep them.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'll do this. So it's a return today with $63.00 taken?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me what credit card you have on file for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can, yes, sir. That's a Discover card that ends in 8027.\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.00. All right, please cancel that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem. You don't want to pause it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, just cancel it. What does a pause mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Basically, I can pause this prescription for you for up to six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way if you ever want to call, place a refill, tell us you need more time, anything like that,\n\nSpeaker 1: You can just reach out to us and say hey, you know, I want an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want it yet, and then set a new date or get it sooner.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so nothing would be charged until I've made the call?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yeah, but if you don't call before July, then it will go out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you have to call us before then, though, and say hey, I want it or I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you've got to reach out to us before July.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, after July, it would just be canceled?\n\nSpeaker 2: After July, it'll send you ten more pills if you don't call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, that's it. Okay, you can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect, perfect. So I'll set that up, and then I'll send you the email.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want to send those pills back for a refund, you can, Mr. Muno, that's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send that to your email here, I have rossglobe at yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and is this the real company?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so we're the face, I'm the customer service for the company, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you call here, this is basically a direct line, yeah, I know the owner, I know the CEO.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I mean the product, is this the real product?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, absolutely, so we get these pills from Pfizer, yeah, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought they were blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so we have the blue pills too, but not the Nuvivar AGV, that's not blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can't put the blue coating on those, they charge more for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We sell those blue pills as well, but these ones are not those.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so no more till July then, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, and then check your email for those return instructions, and you're all set, Mr. Everton.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and no billing, I might just keep them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, yeah, so no billing either, same deal, just give us a call whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, bye now.",
