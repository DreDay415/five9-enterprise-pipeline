You'll get a receipt there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, how many were you looking to order today, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, just the one. I want to try it first. Uh, and I think you get one free today.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right. I was just going to say we have a special so I can get you one for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whenever you're ready, I can take your card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Uh, what I'm using is a, uh, Visa debit. It's a prepaid card. Uh, this one, the number on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: the number on it is 4143-9806-1951-4535.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.

Yeah, it's, uh, well, hold on a second. I'm seeing it. 014.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I did get a decline on that, sir. It doesn't mean that there's not enough money.\n\nSpeaker 2: It could just be something with, on their end because you've never ordered from us before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, what I would, what I would suggest is you call, there's a customer service phone number on the back of that card somewhere.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can call them and ask them and say, hey, I just tried to make a purchase for $49.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you tell me why it didn't go through?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me why it didn't go through?\n\nSpeaker 1: And they'll give you more information if they, and it could be just as simple as we did that to protect you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you could say, oh, please let it go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call us back and we'll put the deal through.\n\nSpeaker 2: If, if for whatever reason, I just want to say one thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: If for whatever reason you're not able to get this sorted out today,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll put a note in your profile that you're on, we'll honor the deal for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we'll still give you the deal, but just call us back once you've talked to them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do I need to ask for you or any?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you'd like to, my name is John and I'm happy to help you again.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to because I'm going to put a note, but I, my name is John and you can ask directly for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. But it's showing that it's not enough money or?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it doesn't show that. It just says soft decline.\n\nSpeaker 2: A soft decline means that the, the card company or whatever it's tied to declined it for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could be as simple as they think it's fraud.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to call them and tell them, no, that's me making a purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: The total on it is what now?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was for $49.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: $49.95. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
