    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello. Hello. Hi there. Sorry, you couldn't hear me. Thank you for calling Viagra. This\n\nSpeaker 2: is Joanna. How can I help you today? I just got my pills in and I got these pills. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name and date of birth so I can reference your account? I figured you\n\nSpeaker 2: might. No worries. My birthday is June 24th. Okay, thank you. Let's see what happened here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the Viagra in front of you? I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you pull out one of the tablets and tell me what it says on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I need a hold of it. Let's see what's on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, can you, are you able to read what it says on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's got a number on it. 339. Is it an AC something? AC, AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's what I suspected. So it looks like the pharmacy made an error, sir, and they sent you\n\nSpeaker 1: the incorrect one. What you have there is generic Viagra. It's FDA approved, but it's not the new\n\nSpeaker 2: and improved AGV. But not to worry. I'm going to send you a replacement order of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: How you're going to know that it's the AGV, it's going to say 100 on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it will also say AGV in parentheses on the prescription label. So I'll get\n\nSpeaker 1: that sent out to you today. So we're not a prescription, sir. We actually, we're a telehealth\n\nSpeaker 2: and we cover the cost of the doctor fee and then the doctor writes the prescription and makes it\n\nSpeaker 1: available with refills. And you as our customer can determine how often and how many you want to\n\nSpeaker 2: get at any time. At any time you can modify that. You can also put a pause on your account for up\n\nSpeaker 1: to six months. So currently you are set up to receive refills on a monthly reoccurring basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll go ahead and remove that. I can place a pause on your account. And I'll put a hold on your\n\nSpeaker 1: account until July. That way, that'll give you plenty of time. Yep. I'll send you, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 2: the replacement order. You'll get that in just a couple of days. Okay. I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Remember to take it on an empty stomach and preferably not with any alcohol.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm glad these ones don't work with my other pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was that? I'm glad these pills don't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You're going to love the AGV. I'm sorry the pharmacist didn't get that to you. But\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to notice a significant difference in how well it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: They really do. They really, really do. You're going to love it. So thank you for calling in\n\nSpeaker 1: to let us know about that. I'm happy I was able to assist you. And thank you for being a VIP\n\nSpeaker 2: status customer. Thanks, ma'am. God bless you. You too.",
