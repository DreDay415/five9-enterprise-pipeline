One moment while I notify the caller.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Carl Lupiana.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Carl. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. How can I help you today, Carl?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I have a recurring subscription that I'd like to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: January 5, 1963.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And you're located at 2610 East Plano Vista Court, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86005?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Yeah, so I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Carl.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option with your prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then, so that would be like the end of July, July 27th,\n\nSpeaker 1: you could, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but I want to cancel. I don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, then that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: In that case, it is my job to let you know, and if you're open to it, great, and if not, no worries,\n\nSpeaker 2: is that if this current prescription doesn't work for you, obviously you don't need it,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it looks like you do qualify for a free sample of our newest highest quality product,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is a superior prescription, and we are currently offering a free sample of that product exclusively to folks\n\nSpeaker 1: whose current script isn't working for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the free sample, it would be 10 pills of our fastest-acting, longest-lasting, and newest product\n\nSpeaker 1: that comes straight from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is we've specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation\n\nSpeaker 1: and headache, and the way it would work is we'd send you 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: It comes with sort of like a five-month free trial where the prescription would start with the 10 free pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: the free sample, and it would be placed on hold for you until June while you try it out, make sure you love it,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you prefer it to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe that you would based off of the reviews and the data, and we believe that you'd give us a call\n\nSpeaker 2: in two to five months to order some, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if not, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's our newest product, and it's definitely a superior prescription to your current one\n\nSpeaker 1: if you were interested in trying it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could send you a free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send it to you at 50 milligrams because that's what you're already approved for,\n\nSpeaker 2: and like I mentioned, it's 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship it to 2610 East Plano Vista Court, Flagstaff, Arizona, 86005?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just sent that to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Normally I'd say you're going to get it by Thursday or Friday, but you know this winter storm is crazy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's probably Saturday, Monday, or Tuesday at the very latest.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, if you need anything before June, the prescription is completely on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give us a call at this phone number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here, even some holidays.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, anything you need, we're around, and I hope you love these, and I think you will,\n\nSpeaker 2: and your old script, of course, is canceled out because they don't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you so much, Carl.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
