    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Hi, Jimmy. I sent a message yesterday that I wanted to cancel the monthly subscription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll just order it as needed. And they said to call this number.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the other thing was that the order had gone out, and I went and tracked it\n\nSpeaker 1: and said it was delivered yesterday, and I have no record of receiving it yesterday or even today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me double check on that. But first of all, let me take care of your first request.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me check on your order first of all to see what's going on with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, okay. I don't show that one that was delivered yet. I have a tracking number for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I don't show that it has been delivered.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see it's still moving through the network with the United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I give you that tracking number if you want to have it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I have that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it's not showing that it was delivered yesterday,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I just want to make sure you have the correct tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me get a pen. Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'm going to give it to you four digits at a time\n\nSpeaker 2: because you know those tracking numbers are kind of long.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9400.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9362.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0769.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9276.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: 7195.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 92.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, quite a long number. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you had a wrong number out there?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I was just looking to see what number it originally had\n\nSpeaker 2: because it said it was delivered yesterday, and I know it wasn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll double check that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's no problem right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, Paul.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get back to your other situation now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I see that you are set up to get them every month as far as a Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're getting the AGB, which is the best Viagra that's out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you, Paul, to keep you getting them at discount price,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can postpone your next order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can put you on like a twice-a-year schedule.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll keep your account active with us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it'll keep you at this discounted price\n\nSpeaker 2: because I know you're going to probably want to get the AGB in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can set up like a postponement for like six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we're very lenient, Paul.\n\nSpeaker 1: If six months is even too long, you just give us a call like you're doing now\n\nSpeaker 2: and say push me back another three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what this also does for you, if you ever want to order in between that time,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can with no problem and still get it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it'll keep you at that six-month intervene,\n\nSpeaker 2: so therefore they're not coming so often,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're keeping that grandfathered in price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let's do that because I had some surgery,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I really haven't been able to use anything until I've had a few weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me give you a date, Paul.\n\nSpeaker 1: The date I have is going to be like August the 5th,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if that comes up too soon for you, just give us a call because we're very lenient\n\nSpeaker 1: with our VIPs and you are a VIP with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And basically with that being said, you can always push it back,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we can do that for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that'll keep you in the system and keep you at the discount price.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you say the other just is still out for delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that one's still out for delivery.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have ten more, and you're getting the AGB, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: the new and improved one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does the AGB have that listed on the pill itself or it's just a number that's on there?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be the number.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you can tell it's the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be the 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you can tell it's the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: And plus the results of the PL2 as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a great day there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
