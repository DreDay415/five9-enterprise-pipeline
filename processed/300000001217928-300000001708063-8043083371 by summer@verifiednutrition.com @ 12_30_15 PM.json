And my wife had passed in April, and I just wanted to experiment. And your pills are okay, but mentally and emotionally, I'm just not there. And the lady sent the second batch, and then I called her and talked to her, and she was real nice. And she said, well, I'll set it up for February, and we won't ship you anymore until February. Well, I've still got three-quarters of a bottle left.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you want to push it out again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ma'am, I've got your number.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I set it where you don't send me anymore, could I call the number and get it reinstated?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull you up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am, 23237.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what is your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael Rivers, RIVERS.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't use it, I don't have to have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just have to use it at the most.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we can cancel it, but you'll pay the regular pricing versus getting the discount, or I can just push you out closer to the end of the year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's do that, because I've got your number. And, again, if I were to, again, I'm 68. I have no prospects, and I'm not actively doing any of that nonsense online and all that stuff. I'm just working on it, and I don't know how it's all going to go. I may have rode the last wave for all I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: But push it back as far as you can, and I've got your number.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I remembered that she was going to send it in February, and mentally I'm still there. So you tell me when it will come as far back as you can push it, and if something were to come up, I'd call you, or if it came the other way, I'd call you and say don't do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So do you know how far you can push it back?\n\nSpeaker 1: I pushed it out to August.\n\nSpeaker 2: August?\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be perfect, ma'am, because if anything, I'd start moving around once it gets summertime and it's warm and you're active and moving more, and that gives me a wider window to maybe meet somebody.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who knows? Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very helpful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
