My name's Lawrence Hughes.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is my third phone call about canceling my prescription, and I just got another one in the mail. Now I want a return label to send it back to you because I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So let me pull up your account and see what's going on here, because if it was canceled, you shouldn't be getting these anymore. Could I get the phone number associated with the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. 914-434-5528.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Lawrence, what they did was, no, you received—they sent you that for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they sent you... I'm looking here, that you called to cancel because you were unhappy with the medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you received is different, and that was free of charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't get the AG, whatever, I didn't get that. I got another prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. The pills, the bottles look similar, but it is different what you just received.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're saying... because I'm saying—\n\nSpeaker 1: It has like 10 pills in it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's what you received yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is different than the medication you received in the past.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can show you on the bottle why it's different.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you look at the pills, those will say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The ones you had prior had something like AC340.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll check them out and see what it says.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it—\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it have 100 on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those say 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: The bottle itself will say Greenstone LLC in the bottom right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's to ensure you that's from Pfizer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you'll see Sidenafil AGV on the front.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they are different medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, it is canceled until I call you back, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is currently paused.\n\nSpeaker 2: Canceling it closes it all together so you don't have access to refills anymore, but—\n\nSpeaker 1: Your account is currently paused.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it looks like, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
