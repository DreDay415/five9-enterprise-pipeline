I need that removed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's fix it. Oh yeah, I see what happened. So Mr. Cooper?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so what happened was in July you paused your account for six months and I think you were up for a refill, but I can reverse that for you, okay, if you're still not ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I canceled it a long time ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you don't want to pause it to reorder?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't want anything to do with it. Just please cancel it and reverse the charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, so you're going to receive your refund of $63.95. I canceled everything. Just keep in mind if you try to reorder, the price will be different. They're going to have to get you a new doctor or consultation, which has a cost. So you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
