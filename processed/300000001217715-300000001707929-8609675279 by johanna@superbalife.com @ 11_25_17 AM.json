And according to your program, they were guaranteed. So I was refunded\n\nSpeaker 1: for one of the prescriptions, but not the other.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I do see here that both were refunded to you. So let me check on the date of that\n\nSpeaker 1: a moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, there's only been one that's been processed.\n\nSpeaker 1: On our end, both have been processed. It may just be something on the bank side. So this\n\nSpeaker 2: refund was issued. This was issued on the 13th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, and there's only one that's been issued. One was issued on the 13th, and it\n\nSpeaker 2: was for $63. There should be two of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, one moment.",
