    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you? Hi, John. I just got my, I\n\nSpeaker 2: ordered score blue from you guys. Yes, sir. All right. I had ordered your ad and\n\nSpeaker 1: what I ordered online was the new blue pill that was the AG whatever it's\n\nSpeaker 2: called. That's not what I received. Okay. I can help you. I do want to let you know\n\nSpeaker 1: the AGV is not blue. It is still white, but I can help you, sir. I need your name\n\nSpeaker 2: and zip code. Charles Frayden, F-R-A-D-I-N. And the zip code is 91604. Thank you. And\n\nSpeaker 1: if we made the mistake like you're saying, which you probably, I'm not\n\nSpeaker 2: doubting you, but if we did we will just fix it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: 160 and a half South Sycamore Avenue. Yes. You mind just... I ordered it and then I\n\nSpeaker 2: also ordered the second bonus, you know, for less money for the extra whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: All I got was 20 pills. Well, that's what you paid for. You bought 10 and then\n\nSpeaker 2: bought 10 more. So the total was... Okay. I wasn't sure if it was 20 plus 10, but\n\nSpeaker 1: okay. No, no, it's okay. Yeah, that's a common question. So that's what that is.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't mind, can you just take out a single pill and tell me what's\n\nSpeaker 1: stamped on it? That'll just help me confirm. Okay, hold on. On the bottle it\n\nSpeaker 2: just says that it's sidenafil citrate 50 milligram tablet. It's... So the AGV is\n\nSpeaker 1: also sidenafil, but it should say AGV, but the pill itself, there's no way the\n\nSpeaker 2: pill can be wrong. So it's it's either wrong or right. There's no great... Hold on\n\nSpeaker 1: one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says AC339. Okay, your pill should have said 50 on it. So that confirms it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna get you 20 of the right ones sent out right away. All right, what do\n\nSpeaker 2: you want me to do with these? If you don't want them, you can throw them away. They\n\nSpeaker 1: are safe to take, but you don't have to keep them if you don't want them. All\n\nSpeaker 2: right, but what was your name again? My name is John, sir. All right, John, so but\n\nSpeaker 1: then what is this that you just sent me? That's just a standard generic like you\n\nSpeaker 2: could get at your pharmacy. We sell both types, so there was a mix-up somewhere in\n\nSpeaker 1: the filling process that they put that one in there instead. So it's still FDA\n\nSpeaker 2: approved. It's still safe. It's just not the AGV. It's just a standard generic\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra. And if I went to use it, so it doesn't start in 15 minutes like the\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV, right? This one is going to be closer to an hour, but it would still be safe\n\nSpeaker 1: and effective. It should still be effective and it's definitely still safe,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it would be closer to an hour if you did use it. And the AGV one said\n\nSpeaker 1: that it was 100 milligrams, didn't it? Well, you put in for 50. If you want me to\n\nSpeaker 2: change it to 100, I can. It's not going to charge you anything\n\nSpeaker 1: different. I just would have to change it. It's 100 a lot. You know, I used to take\n\nSpeaker 2: 20, so I'm not sure. If you're not sure, the doctor usually does suggest start at\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 and see how that goes for you, because a lot of people think they might\n\nSpeaker 2: need 100, but they actually only need 50. And if you do need two, you can take two\n\nSpeaker 1: and we can always bump you up in the future. If you want me to switch it to\n\nSpeaker 2: 100, I can. You can also cut those in half. It just really depends on what you\n\nSpeaker 1: want, sir, because I'm just going to get it for you. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd give me\n\nSpeaker 2: the 100 and if you get those right out to me. I'd appreciate it. I don't think I\n\nSpeaker 1: want to take these. I'm nervous about that, all right? Okay, that's fine. You\n\nSpeaker 2: don't have to take them. I promise you they're safe, but you do not have to take\n\nSpeaker 1: them, so I'm going to get you the right one. All right, John. Thanks a lot. So that'll\n\nSpeaker 2: come out to me? Yes, exactly. It'll be shipped to you just like this one was, and I\n\nSpeaker 1: will keep an eye on it to make sure there's nothing delaying it. Thanks for\n\nSpeaker 2: being so kind. All right. Of course. Have a good one, Charles. Bye.",
