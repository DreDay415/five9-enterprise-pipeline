    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Robert Beckstopper.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Robert. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm fine. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today, Robert?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm calling about RX number 9905115.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. So I just need you to confirm your date of birth because I think I already have you pulled up.\n\nSpeaker 2: 090952.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And you're located at 2020 Fledge Street in Richmond, Virginia?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. I love Richmond. Okay. Yeah. So how can I help you today, Robert?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I ordered this product back on 12-4, and I got some extra ones all on 12-4.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never signed up for repeat, you know, deliveries.\n\nSpeaker 2: I only wanted the one-time purchase and delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: And in the mail today, I don't know if it was today.\n\nSpeaker 2: It might have been the other day because I was on vacation.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I've gotten a repeat delivery, and I don't want any repeats.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So if you don't want to receive those regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to want to get any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I really don't want this repeat that they sent me that costs $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just assume they pick them up or send a return delivery thing or something and get credited for that $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So the pills, they didn't – yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pills, they didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they actually worked okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I went and I have a doctor for this stuff, and he wrote me a prescription for the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, I mean, I was trying them at first, but he wrote me a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when I get that filled through Medicare and all that kind of stuff, it doesn't cost me anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, they work okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I only was intending to buy it that one time, PC, back on 12-4.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, the last part of my job is just to let you know, and if you're into it, great,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if not, no worries, that you do qualify, if you were interested,\n\nSpeaker 1: for a free sample of our newest highest quality stuff because it looks like you haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So our newest –\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm really – I appreciate the offer, but I'm okay. I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't need to try anything else, even for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, that's totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So I can send you an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: The e-mail we have on file is robertatbextoffer, like your last name, dot com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Dot com. That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: With the return instructions.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then once we receive the product back, we can refund it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Great. So you'll get that e-mail in the next few minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, I hope you have a great day, and your script is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Appreciate it. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Okay. Bye, Robert.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
