    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Chris Lincoln.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Chris. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How can I help you today, Chris?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to cancel my subscription or membership or whatever it's called.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can certainly help you with this. Okay, Chris, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4-5-86.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 34 Cobra Road, Harleyville, Pennsylvania, 19438.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Chris, well, just so you know, because it looks like you've been with us for a while, you do always have the option with your prescription, if you don't want to receive those regular refills anymore,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to, you always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to order at any point before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's okay. I just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, everything's fine. I just want to cancel the subscription or membership or whatever we're calling it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, it's my job to let you know we do only pay for that pharmacy fee once,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because we do offer the option to place the prescription on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if I decide to whatever, get another subscription or membership or prescription or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you just have to pay the whole additional $30 pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be on top of your regular rate.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last part of my job is to let you know about, and if you're interested, great, and if not, no worries,\n\nSpeaker 1: is if the pills were not working for you, you do qualify for a free sample of our newest,\n\nSpeaker 1: highest quality product that comes with a five-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it looks like you haven't tried it before, which is why you qualify.\n\nSpeaker 1: So our newest product would be, it would be 10 pills that I'd send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it is the fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then my favorite thing about it is that we specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you did want to try it, I'd send you 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd probably get them by next Wednesday, depending on that crazy winter storm stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's wild.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then you'd have until June to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe you would, based off of the data, and we believe you'd give us a call two to five months from now to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that would make it worth it to us to be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if they didn't work for any reason, that's totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to call this number.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, they are a superior prescription of what you have now, and they are the best product in the U.S., at least.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are the only sellers of them, and we sell them directly through the Pfizer labs in France,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we paid a few million dollars to be able to say that and do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Same active ingredient?\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's a great question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pildenafil is going to be the active ingredient in every Viagra product ever made\n\nSpeaker 1: and probably ever made until the end of time, including the branded Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you send me the free sample, you're saying it's just a free sample and that I can still decide to...\n\nSpeaker 1: It would be placed on hold until June, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'd have kind of like a five-month free trial where basically, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't exactly say free trial only because prescriptions are, you know, they're legal.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not like we're throwing pills around, like it would be a new prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the prescription would be placed on hold for you during that duration of time while you try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're saying five months free, or is it one free trial?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that's also a good question.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's one, and it's ten pills, and you get them like next week,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you just have until June to try them out, run out of them, love them, ideally.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so you send one until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, okay, yeah, I guess that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll have to go through this again if I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if they didn't work for you, you didn't like them, whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to send them out to you at 100 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ship these to 34 Cobra Road, Harleysville, Pennsylvania, 19438?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just placed that so you should receive those by next week, Thursday, Friday, the very latest, but probably Monday or Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yeah, just let us know by June.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just a reminder, if you want to get the most out of them, Chris, just make sure you take them on an empty stomach, that's very important, and that you avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not as much for safety concerns, but more so because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I hope you love these, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
