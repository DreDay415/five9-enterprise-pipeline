    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have a question about the new AGV at Viagra. What's the price of that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. Price, yes. So there's three options.\n\nSpeaker 2: Forty pills, $149, $25, $99, and then $10 is $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I have an account. Can you pull me up and see if I'm still in there? It's been a lot of years.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bobby Barr, 37620.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okey dokey, 386 Sinking Springs Road?\n\nSpeaker 2: Extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Bristol, Tennessee, 37620?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. I do see that you ordered with us 2022, so yeah, it's been a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's been a while. I would like to try the new one, but I don't want to do a whole bunch just in case it doesn't work like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you want to try the $10 to start?\n\nSpeaker 2: How much was the $10?\n\nSpeaker 1: That was the $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it was $100 for how many?\n\nSpeaker 1: $25.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, I got confused. $25 for $100, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, $25 pills is $99. $10 pills is $49. Everything comes with a money back guarantee.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you're looking to get your better value, the $25 pills is going to be better value.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if it doesn't work, you can still get a refund on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's just try the $25 pills then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you want to do 100 milligrams on those though?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, whenever you're ready, I just need an updated card, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me go over here. It should be – I know it's been changed since then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 4096291000005423.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 2: 127.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the security code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 102.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we're all set, Bobby.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what happens next is your prescription just gets renewed, and then we'll ship this out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would expect it to get to you in about a week's time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know how it goes, if that works out better for you than before.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have any issues or questions, just call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you are all set and good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you give me the – did you get the extension on the address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you don't, the extension won't show up.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is on there, yes. That is on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know I didn't say it, but it is on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's exactly where it's going to be mailed out to.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you do have questions along the way, just call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, sir.
