I'll pull up your profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maceo? Is that how I say your name? Maceo. Maceo.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maceo. Can you just confirm your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-21-74.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. And how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It did not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think I see the problem. Do you happen to have them on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: On me? I mean, they're...\n\nSpeaker 2: I have the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just want to... Can you take out one pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to know if it says AC imprinted on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, yes, AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay. So the pharmacy made an error and just sent you regular generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why they're not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second. I'm going to get you out a replacement\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to send you 100 milligrams instead.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could just break them in half if you need to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. All right, that went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so when you get this new bottle in the mail,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's going to say AGB on the bottle, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now, yeah, your pill say AC and on the bottle it says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 1: So those are just regular generics.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it till July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way the pharmacy will be able to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll give you my extension so you can call me back and let me know how the AGB works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: AGB 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my name's Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: One L or two L's?\n\nSpeaker 1: Two.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then AGB 100 and you said Bluestone?\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Bluestone on the bottle and the only thing imprinted on the pill is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then July, sorry, June or July?\n\nSpeaker 2: July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
