    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quinn speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was given this number as a contact because I was not happy with my order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Am I speaking to Scott?\n\nSpeaker 1: You are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Scott, I do see you are a VIP customer here getting a Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you identify what the issue is?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, you guys advertise this new fancy Viagra, A, G, V, or B, or whatever it is on your pages, and I had sent, I already get a prescription for the Cedela fill from my provider, and I pay less than 50 cents a pill when I get it filled at Costco for a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, these were very expensive pills of the same thing I'm taking.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I even told the provider.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's not the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Cedela fill is just a medical term for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any, doesn't matter what Viagra you get, it's going to have that name on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just what it is called, but the quality of the medication you are taking is why it does cost more.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pretty sure that stuff you're getting so far cheap, if you go check the back of those bottles, probably says it's coming from India or China, which has very low regulatory systems for their medications, not where the stuff you're getting from us is actually coming from the United States, or we do have our A, G, V that is coming from France, from the original Viagra facilities, because that's where it was created, so you're paying for quality and you're paying for safety, not just, I mean, there's a difference, a car is a car, but obviously there's a higher quality car than something that may be cheaper.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yes, it is cheap, but it does not mean it's safe, or that it may not damage things because who knows what they're putting in it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nobody does, because they don't have systems to regulate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I do see you were supposed to get the A, G, V here, and if you did not get that, I do not mind reshipping it to you, sir, I'm not sure why that happened here.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do, I can just simply reship that out to you, free of charge, say that's what you were supposed to order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the bottle says Sidenafil 100mg tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's supposed to say A, G, V on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does not, I don't, where would it say A, G, V?\n\nSpeaker 2: I assume it would be right by the name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, like right around by the, like the milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, it does not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can simply just contact the pharmacy to actually confirm, but I'm not going to make you do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just going to reship this out to you, sir, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, it doesn't say A, G, V, hold on, let me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so this bottle, this will also be white in diamond shape, that is our trademark from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this will be, only have the milligram dosage on one side of the pill, which would be a 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: It won't have anything else on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, let me look at these.\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe those probably say like AC390 or something like that on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get a flashlight here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nah, no worries here, I don't want to make you have to do all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just let me make sure I reship you out the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know you're getting the white ones this time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to make you have to do all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it says AC, yeah, yeah, 340.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, yes, that is incorrect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why that went out that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will change this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'd like, I can even give you my name and extension, you know, if you have any issues in the future, I can always, you know, help you out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I am going to make sure that this doesn't also happen again, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, what's your name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: So the name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my extension is going to be 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Quinn, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'll ship that out, let's not do a reorder right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would like to see how they work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you want, I could just, like, pause it for about, like, four months or so and give you some time and call me back at that same number and, you know, let me know how you want to proceed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hey, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much for your assistance.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, yeah, you're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give me a ring when you try them out and, like I said, we'll pick back up from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll look forward to getting those.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you have a great day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
