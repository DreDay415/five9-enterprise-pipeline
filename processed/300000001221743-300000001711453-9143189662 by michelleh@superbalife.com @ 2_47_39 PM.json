    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just received a bill on my Amex for a shipment. I never ordered, I never signed up for a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me a second. I'm going to pull up your profile and get you help. All right, Jeffrey, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-10-48.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Is your VIP status customer? Oh, I see you on, they put you on automatic refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second. I'm going to cancel that out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect. Jeffrey, I was able to cancel out that refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you'll be seeing $63.95 back on your credit card in about five business days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then how is the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't tried it yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah, so with your VIP status, you don't have to have your refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause that for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in anytime you need a refill. And it keeps your price rate locked in.\n\nSpeaker 2: So prices go up, yours stays the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could pause that for you until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's okay, if they'll notify me in advance.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's the only thing, they don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, then I don't want to freeze it, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and canceled you out. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a great evening. Bye.",
