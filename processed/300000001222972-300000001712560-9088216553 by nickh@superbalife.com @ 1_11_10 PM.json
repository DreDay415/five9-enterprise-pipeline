    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, just calling. I wanted to stop my, um, you know, the monthly, uh—\n\nSpeaker 1: Charges to my credit card. I don't need them this often. So I'm just gonna, I want to just—\n\nSpeaker 2: Do it on my own schedule and not have this automatic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Yeah, it's perfectly adjustable here. Let me take a look at your prescription and see how it was organized by the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could I get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: John Bogle, July 19th, 1959.\n\nSpeaker 1: So John, I see that prescription was originally written in December. That's for the 50 milligram Viagra, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the doctor here wrote it with refills and that was due to the lower milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so that being said John, um, yeah, you're not required or obligated to get these monthly. It's not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a perfectly adjustable prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want, I could put this on an extended pause and that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be much better. Thank you. I would like that because I, I don't need them that often.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anything else I need to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I went ahead and put that pause on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the next time you're running low you can just give us a call and we can effectively put that—\n\nSpeaker 1: You know and order it for you. You have a few refills left under the script still.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, have a nice day. Bye. Thank you.",
