    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Facilite. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, good morning. I just didn't know if I needed to speak to a supervisor or a manager or something, but I'm kind of unhappy with the results of my ordering and then wanted to reorder. So can I talk to you about that, or should I get a manager online?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, on the 21st, I think it was a Thursday or Friday of November, I placed an order for just one bottle just to try it out. And anyways, I didn't get anything like a response on, which you guys don't do. I made a call then on Monday after that weekend because I hadn't seen anything like, you know, an acknowledgment that the order went through or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when I called in on that Monday, a gentleman had answered, and he said, no, there's no problem, it's already been processed today.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. And he said, and it's going out. All right. So I'm there thinking, okay, well, you know, if it's processed and going out, it's going to take maybe three or four days, you know, to get there, which I was okay with. And then I got some kind of thing about a text message, or I can't remember if it was a text or an email, but it said, you know, to track my order. And so I looked at that, and it says December 6th.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. So I wasn't real happy about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then on Friday here, I'll tell you what happened. I saw that you had the two-for-one special for whatever, Black Friday or something like that, I guess it was. Are you familiar with that? Okay. So I thought, well, you know, all the advertisements sounded real good. I haven't got my first bottle yet, so I haven't, you know, I was kind of upset about that. So Friday afternoon, I mean, here on the East Coast, it was probably like around 5 o'clock. I'm not sure. Okay. I called to order the two bottles. All right. And when I called, it was, I don't know, the hours weren't right or something. You guys were closed. So then I couldn't even place that order. I don't know if you understand what I'm saying, but I guess you guys close, like, Friday, you know, early. And then you're closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So your first order, you should be receiving it on Thursday, December 4th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it normally take that long to get an order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Two to seven business days for you to receive it, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because of the holiday, obviously, there were going to be some delays when shipping your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the post office doesn't work for holidays.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I know that. Believe me.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm flexible there, but then when I hit this, where I missed getting the order in, does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you want to go ahead and place that order for the Black Friday?\n\nSpeaker 2: Which one are you interested in?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just so I was going to get the two bottles.\n\nSpeaker 2: You buy one, you get another one, half price.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's buy one, get one free for $49.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or buy two, get two free for $99.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or the buy three, get three free for $149.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or buy six, get six free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which one do you want so that I can go ahead and assist you with placing the order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I can't right now because I'm driving. You know, but I just wanted to place the call. I didn't even know if you were open today, you know, because it's Super Monday or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, go ahead and just give me a call back once you stop driving.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Gabriela.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gabriela.\n\nSpeaker 2: Boy, that's a pretty name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll remember that name.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a pretty name.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I will call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to take me some time here, about a half hour, 45 minutes before I get off the road here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I should still be here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can give me a call and then just ask for me when you call.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I can go ahead and give you that special.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, that makes me feel good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And hopefully I'll be happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to start trying it when it comes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the first bottle here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you should be receiving it on Thursday, your first bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, Lawrence.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
