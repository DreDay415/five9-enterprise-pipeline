    "text": "Speaker 1: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who is this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Ronald Fantone.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just a little bit ago signed up for a – I heard the commercial on the radio, so I signed\n\nSpeaker 2: up for the trial and stuff to get the pills sent to me, and then I took the offer for\n\nSpeaker 1: the additional discount on the second 40 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So after I was – after I sent the order and stuff, I was looking at the website,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I went into my account, and I noticed that there's nowhere to turn off auto shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I started looking online, and I see there's multiple complaints to the Better Business\n\nSpeaker 1: Bureau about –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Before you even – go ahead, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order this as needed, or you can get it exactly when you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's totally up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in my account, there's things for auto shipment, like next shipment, and I can't\n\nSpeaker 2: turn it off.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're blocked.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was my concern, that I couldn't stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can stop and postpone orders, but you can only do it on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anything larger than that has to be done on this end, so we can contact the pharmacy to\n\nSpeaker 1: do so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to postpone.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just – I don't want any more shipments after this.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you can order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to have to – I just want it sent.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want it stopped, because I don't want it – if I forget, it gets auto-shipped,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I – you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, if I do it one month, and then –\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not what I stated.\n\nSpeaker 2: So basically, we would just keep your prescription open, and you would call when you need your\n\nSpeaker 1: orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: Simple.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got done reading, like, 50 complaints of people were told the same thing, and then\n\nSpeaker 1: –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Compared to the thousands of customers we get a day, that's really not a large number.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, but it does – I mean, it has to work – I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Listen, I'm a district manager myself, and if I have, like, my business, if I had 50\n\nSpeaker 2: to 60 complaints, obviously, it's happening.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I have six storage facilities I run.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's about 800 tenants in each facility, so –\n\nSpeaker 1: And I only ask because we do have a lot of older customers that really aren't tech-savvy\n\nSpeaker 2: a lot, and they do order things, and they don't really read everything through, and\n\nSpeaker 1: then by the time we get on the phone with them to help them, they're just pissed off.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're cussing us out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go to bed.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm not going to –\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not even –\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to cuss you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's generally something that we could have helped with, or, like, they go dispute\n\nSpeaker 2: it, and it's like, you could have just called us, we could have refunded it, we – first,\n\nSpeaker 1: we tell them, you could have always set it up the way you wanted to, we're actually\n\nSpeaker 2: very flexible, we're very transparent, but, you know, some people have issues of sometimes\n\nSpeaker 1: being online, or we get, like, asked because we have a lot of older customers, guys in\n\nSpeaker 2: their 70s, their 80s, we have 90-odd customers, and I guess I could say that maybe they're\n\nSpeaker 1: not always tech-savvy, and things happen, things are missed, and, you know, that's\n\nSpeaker 2: how we end up with, you know, some of those reviews there, but, I mean, we're actually\n\nSpeaker 1: very flexible with the way –\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my question is then, because, like, when I'm in my account, where it says about your\n\nSpeaker 2: next prescription and to put it off or to delay it, it – the boxes are, like, you\n\nSpeaker 1: get, like, the circle with the red line, like, the old Ghostbuster thing, like, it won't\n\nSpeaker 2: let me do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you – what browser are you on?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have an – yeah, I have a work laptop.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on – I know it's an updated, I think, like, 11, I think, but everything's all new.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's my company laptop, so everything –\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it is on there, you know, definitely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, once you log in and you go to your prescription, maybe it was just, like, a – I'm not sure\n\nSpeaker 1: what happened here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let me do it one more time, and I'll tell you what I see, because that's\n\nSpeaker 1: what I always feel, which is, like, I – you know, is these two doses are going to last\n\nSpeaker 2: me – what I ordered is going to last me a long time, so I'm not worried about having\n\nSpeaker 1: to order for a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, generally –\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't want to forget three months down the road and –\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but those reviews, I was, like, damn, I wonder if there's something to this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, there is a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I wasn't even – I'm not even arguing with you, but a lot of times I feel\n\nSpeaker 2: like it's just misinformation and frustrated people that, you know – and I get it, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: There are a lot of companies that have really bad practices out there, so a lot of guys\n\nSpeaker 1: have already experienced bad stuff, and it's kind of –\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I log in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on the page that says, welcome back, Ronald.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I log in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go to your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I see quick refill, and then I see get a refill now, change next auto shipment, change\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: It should give you the option under your prescription right there to just stop auto shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the last button on the bottom right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I got a red box that says, with an exclamation point, ordering transit, please contact customer\n\nSpeaker 1: service to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, but if you go to your page and you go to – you click on the link, your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you – let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because the auto ship box is there.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does say, every three months, it says next order date April 28th, and then it says delay\n\nSpeaker 1: to next month and stop auto shipment, but when I click on stop auto shipment –\n\nSpeaker 2: That's stop auto shipment.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you would stop it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is the button.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and it says, are you sure you want to stop?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I click yes, and then I get the pop-up box that says, please contact customer service\n\nSpeaker 2: to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's when we – they ask to give us a call so we can make sure, you know, that\n\nSpeaker 1: you are canceling, because believe it or not, we get a lot of wives and stuff like that\n\nSpeaker 2: that cancel guys' accounts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe they didn't tell their –\n\nSpeaker 2: See, that was a couple of complaints, too, that I read, was like, they make it so, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: they put this button on here.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says you can stop it, but you never can.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have to call someone, and then there were complaints no one answers, or it doesn't\n\nSpeaker 2: get done, or it takes a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what's worrying me, because now this is what's happening to me, because I'm clicking\n\nSpeaker 2: the button, and it won't let me stop it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it is getting stopped, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just referring – it's referring you to us to go ahead and, you know, just stop\n\nSpeaker 1: it for you, because we do get those alerts there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so are you going to stop it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that's what you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'll order again if I need it, but I don't want to be locked in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so maybe the whole locked in – it's just a prescription, and it doesn't last\n\nSpeaker 2: forever, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, people pay for prescriptions, you know, pharmacy –\n\nSpeaker 2: I get that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want this shipment stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, I want it stopped.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the order that you have coming out.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: The next auto shipment, which is in April.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want that one stopped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, I'll pay for – I'm not debating.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not – like, I'll pay for what I just ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: See, generally, what we do, we will keep the prescription open, and you can call for your\n\nSpeaker 2: orders in a six-month period.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can't get it every six months, but we have to keep – you've got to have a\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription to get a medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: You get what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you cancel a prescription, there's no medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm not canceling the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to stop the next auto shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has nothing to do with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just trying to follow.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm on the same page with you there, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just trying to make sure I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's how we'll set it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we can keep the prescription open.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will have to call for your orders in the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will not get anything unless you call for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can even give you my extension, if you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can make sure that's in order for you and even place your next order for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is going to be 0035 at the same phone number that you called in at.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I do appreciate your time, and let me try to explain some of that to you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just, like, I'm not trying to be difficult.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, I mean, I would expect something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, now if I refresh my account, like, it's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now it pushed it out to July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it just keeps pushing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that is just keeping your prescription available.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we're not going to send anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're just going to, we're just keeping your prescription open.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you call for your next order, basically what we'll do is we'll push it out six months from the next day you call,\n\nSpeaker 1: and just kind of repeat that process so we can just keep it open and you call for your next one.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how do you, like, if I get this stuff and I'm, like, I'm not going to order anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, there's nothing on here to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me at that same extension, and I'll delete your whole prescription and account, and you'll never be billed again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or I just keep pushing this out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so basically we would keep it open six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: You would call whenever you want in that time period.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whenever you do call, we'll push it out six months from that day.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you would call again when you want it, and we would just keep pushing it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that way you can call when you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we're keeping your prescription available so you can get it whenever you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not having to make a whole other, you know, doctor's visit and prescription every time you want a few pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's totally up to you, sir. I totally understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, if I can, I'll definitely do what I can to help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just, like I said, I feel like it's, because I did use HIMSS.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, like, you could go on there, same thing, delay, delay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, like, as far as closing it out, like, I literally, when I signed up for this,\n\nSpeaker 2: I just went on there, it says manage subscriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: At the bottom it says cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: I asked you, are you sure? I hit yes, and it was done.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got an email confirmation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Generally, we don't, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, because you need the prescription, but we'll do this.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, if you want to just use it and try it first, you have my extension and my number.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will stop all this, not even a six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will put, I will stop it all.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you call me back and you let me know that you actually like it,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can reset everything up for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Would that make you feel more comfortable?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that would be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I will stop it, but don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: We will reset it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I really want you to feel more comfortable.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, if you go back on there now, you will see that everything is stopped.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you got my number, got my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: Use them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me back when you feel comfortable.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll give you my word.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll reset this up for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's like down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, I see this quick refill thing here.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I hit this, would this automatically start the auto-ship and all that stuff again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, which is another reason why we always state to call us and not put the orders in online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because when we do it on this side, we can make sure it stays the way that you want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes, we put an order online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'll just, that's what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like that better than working online.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just call every time and order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, and you have my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have the notes here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told you so I can make sure that, you know, it stays this way for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I see the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: The problem doesn't seem like the reviews.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, everyone generally, this shit works.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, honestly, all the complaints are about the, I don't know if you can pass that on to your boss.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, all about the...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I sure will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Every complaint that I read, there was nothing about the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: I read like 60 reviews.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was put on auto-pay without my consent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, HIMSS, when I signed up, you go through a couple screens where it's like,\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, you're going to be, this will be auto-shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you consent?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you hit yes or no?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you hit no, then it tells you, well, you'll have to order month by month.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, and you have to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, like, with this, there was nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why when I got to the end, I was kind of like,\n\nSpeaker 2: So, when's my next shipment coming?\n\nSpeaker 1: It won't go out that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unless...\n\nSpeaker 1: Because there's options on there to choose, like, as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I was saying, like, the six months you order it yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the frequency.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if that's not chosen,\n\nSpeaker 2: then that's the only way it'll go out the way...\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just call and order from now on.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll be easier.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you got my extension actually helps you when you call in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I hope you're working there a long time.\n\nSpeaker 1: In my business, like, one person does an extension for about a month.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they call and it's like, we get that complaint.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're like, I talked to this nice person\n\nSpeaker 2: and gave me his number and I called the extension\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're like, they don't work here anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's like, oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, trust me, I'm part of the family here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, man, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've been very helpful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, I hope you enjoy them, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.",
