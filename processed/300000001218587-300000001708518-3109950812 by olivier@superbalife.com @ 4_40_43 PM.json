You may have used a different one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we'll try 562-233-9418.\n\nSpeaker 2: There we go, Mr. Gilbert Estrada.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so I see that you have a Rescoblue VIP account for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a prescription for Viagra 100 mg from Dr. Green, 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need your refill as often?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just don't need it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have the pharmacy pausing everything. You can order as needed. Monthly is not required.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's okay. I'd just like to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, just keep in mind, if something changes, because I'm cancelling the doctor consultation,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to have a different price because, of course, they're going to have to refinance a new doctor evaluation,\n\nSpeaker 2: which could have an impact on your price in the future if you try to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why they offer to pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm cancelling the doctor prescription and the new VIP account.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Estrada, I cancelled everything. Consultation cancelled and account is cancelled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get a confirmation sent to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can have a confirmation number over the phone if you like, if you have a pen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set. Bye-bye.",
