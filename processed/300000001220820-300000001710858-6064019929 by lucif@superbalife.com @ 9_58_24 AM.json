    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey bud, I need to cancel this. I got a surprise prescription in the mail today. I need to cancel this thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's see what's going on. Is your name Mark?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty Mark, I do see you are a VIP with us here at Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do not have to order it like that sir. You can order this as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to get it automatically.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't ever want to get it automatically. I don't know why I'm getting it automatically to be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that happens in your knucklehead like me you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It only happens that way if you basically don't choose how you want it to come out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you first order it you can choose as needed or you can set it to day or month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure I goofed it up. But anyway, I need to try to fix it. I can't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well I can set it up for you now so you can order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, if you would do that that would be great. Don't send me any more surprises.\n\nSpeaker 1: So basically how it works is the next six months we're going to keep this prescription open.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're going to have to call in for your next order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good to me buddy. So I call this number and say send me some or whatever?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can take my name and extension as well. Yes, call this number and I can also make sure it stays like this for you too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, and what is your name sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Q-U-I-N-N, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your extension number bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you. Alright bud, I'll put that on my contacts.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to need some more I'll just give you a call, okay bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you my friend. You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You as well. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
