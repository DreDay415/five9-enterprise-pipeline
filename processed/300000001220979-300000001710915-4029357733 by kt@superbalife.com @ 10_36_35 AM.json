    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Mr. Bud, John, hey, thank you so much for your demeanor, your class, and your style,\n\nSpeaker 2: sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did is I did my due diligence, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's no fault of your own, and it's just, it's what it is, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is what I did is I contacted on my behalf, your behalf, and the company, I contacted\n\nSpeaker 2: our pharmacy, I did my due diligence, they checked the cameras, and I went into the chart,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they cross-verified.\n\nSpeaker 2: When we looked at the drugs and the cameras, they saw that it was 20 quantities that was\n\nSpeaker 1: sent to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you please look into the bottle again and look and verify if you got 20?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, give me a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm about to take the bottle out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm about to take the bottle out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm about to take the bottle out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm about to take the bottle out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm about to take the bottle out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm about to take the bottle out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me tell them, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just know, Mr. Bud, that we're a team.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's work together, and whatever we come upon will make it good for you, will make\n\nSpeaker 1: it right for you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll try to do our best, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all about integrity and nobility for us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's my mistake, because I did get 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've only used one.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here's what I'll do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've used one of these, and really, I don't see a difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is what we'll do.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't know if I should be telling things.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is what we'll do to make things right, because especially the weather, we're getting\n\nSpeaker 2: a lot of pushback with clients that the weather's getting really bad, tough, people are getting\n\nSpeaker 1: snowed in, and then we just want to be about safety and security and to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there's two things we could do.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they're not working at this point because the bottles already didn't open and all that,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they tried it, that's good to know that it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'll do now is what we can do is I can send you something that's been, that will\n\nSpeaker 2: for you, right, that for no charge, and I'll bill the actual doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it won't cost you anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you pill for pill 20 to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if these things don't work and they don't, we cross that bridge in a month or two, then\n\nSpeaker 2: we start to talk about at least half a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we'll be upside down at that point, but the idea is to get the vitality that you deserve,\n\nSpeaker 2: right, and then that you're not upside down, so it's a win-win-win.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if those things don't work, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I'm a diabetic and that kind of stuff, too, so I have high blood pressure.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, and I do see your chart, and the stuff that I have that is beautiful, it's for cases like you,\n\nSpeaker 2: right, nine out of 10, when someone has some type of diabetes or prostate problem\n\nSpeaker 1: and certain viagras, even our new and improved ADV doesn't work, we have a reserve.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is our golden goose.\n\nSpeaker 1: The way you take it is with no ultra-processed foods or oils, no heavy foods that are highly processed.\n\nSpeaker 2: It goes smooth down your esophagus, and with no acid reflex, right, no heartburn or indigestion,\n\nSpeaker 1: it slides down.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill is a little sandy on top and smooth at the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to look identical.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be diamond-shaped, but it's going to have a 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what happens is it goes down.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you take it with water, no soda, no wine, no alcohol, what it does,\n\nSpeaker 1: it drops to the bottom of your gut like a bowling ball, and it disperses like a hand grenade,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pill shoots a web around the inner lining of your gut membrane.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then your gut membrane sends a message to your hippocampus.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then your brain tells your heart where your arc of the aorta is to disperse 70% of blood\n\nSpeaker 1: to the two chambers in your penile arteries, which is the arteries that create that spongy tissue\n\nSpeaker 2: resulting into the erection.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's run this play.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take down my number, Mr. Butts.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way if things don't work out, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can just bow out, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But don't worry about any charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about any monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am worried about charges because I cannot afford $63.95 a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't realize that was going to cost me that much.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that part is where I'm trying to get taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need that to go away.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need that out of my bill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if that's the case, I completely understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: What we can do is the best we can do, because you already have those pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can maybe remove $10.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if it's a $63.95 that you never intended, let me put you on a refold\n\nSpeaker 1: and try to find other solutions because I never crossed a bridge like this.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's try to find something out, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's work with what we have here.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what we do.\n\nSpeaker 2: We create solutions as Americans, and we're the best.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're the best, and we're going to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two minds are better than one, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me go to work for you and figure this out, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And if it's about the money, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll make it right because we're all suffering here.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're all just trying to get by.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're living 20 cents to the dollar, and we'll make it right, all right, Bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me figure this out, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me walk down the hall.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me walk down the hall.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, there's no such thing as a reoccurring.\n\nSpeaker 1: What it could be is the doc.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so let's just work on this first, first things first, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go to BAP for you, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment.",
