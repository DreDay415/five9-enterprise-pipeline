Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, because that lasts me for six months, you know, it's not like I…\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have to call every day, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, I mean for six months, it should be plenty.\n\nSpeaker 2: And for some reason, if it changes, then I'll be glad to call back and say, hey…\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, let's do it every four months before right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have a lot from before.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got another container to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I think I'm going to be definitely okay for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you can put a…\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that way you lock your pricing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and that way you lock your pricing.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you don't pay a new price as well when you get to refill or reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, that's a good part about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I'd advise the pharmacy, you know, nothing to worry about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Deposit the prescription for you and you can reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: In six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And thank you for making the time to call and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great weekend coming up and be safe, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: You too as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
