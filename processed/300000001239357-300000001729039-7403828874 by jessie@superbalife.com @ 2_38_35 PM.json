    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Harold Simpkins.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. And Mr. Simpkins, what is your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 43302.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Are you still at 1129 Richland Road in Marion, Ohio?\n\nSpeaker 2: I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty then. Let's take a quick look. And then what can I help you with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I must have hit the wrong button there. They sent me another prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I must be on a monthly bill or something. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Yeah. Now, would you like me to turn that off?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me go ahead and do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a quick question, though. Would you prefer that it be on demand, meaning you can just order whenever you feel like it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to set it up like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me do that. And hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is on demand. You can order whenever you, you know, you won't get anything in the mail, nothing random.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear in mind, though, to keep your prescription active if you do not order anything after six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does say one refill, and that's it. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
