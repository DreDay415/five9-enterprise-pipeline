    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Beckwell.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, um, I had a charge put on my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, I made a purchase in November, and then this was January,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you had put another charge on my card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what happened?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I didn't order anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a Philcox, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I know what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: So basically, you had a prescription for Viagra AEDV 100 milligram,\n\nSpeaker 2: and Dr. Tariq wrote your prescription with refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it was, I think, two to three months after,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they sent you a refill because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's the initial prescription, assuming that you're active.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you're not active, sir, I can advise the pharmacy to pause\n\nSpeaker 1: so you're going to order as needed instead\n\nSpeaker 2: because you're not required to get it as often.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just the initial prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have to go based on that moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can tell the pharmacy to stop the initial writing,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you're going to get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be off for half a year, and you can get it once or twice a year\n\nSpeaker 2: if you're not that active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it didn't really, it didn't work for me,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I didn't order another one.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that was your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you took Cialis in the past?\n\nSpeaker 1: Was Cialis more effective for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not really.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, both don't really work?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: This was the first time to try yours.\n\nSpeaker 2: But do you think the Viagra was slightly better than Cialis experience?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not that I could tell.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're kind of equal as far as the results?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's unusual.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually one's going to be in favor but more\n\nSpeaker 2: because they work with body chemistry,\n\nSpeaker 1: so usually body for men works either with Cialis or Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to assess and see where you were standing at with your meds.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I can pause you if you feel like it's not really working,\n\nSpeaker 2: and instead of getting 25 you can get 10 pills once or twice\n\nSpeaker 1: just as a backup little support.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I have patients who told me a couple of times\n\nSpeaker 1: that when they get into the new meds,\n\nSpeaker 2: what happens is the body doesn't really recognize what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's new, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what they did, because that's the only pill they had,\n\nSpeaker 1: they were micro-dosing it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's say they got 100, they were cutting half,\n\nSpeaker 1: or they got 50, they cut half,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they keep taking it here and there\n\nSpeaker 1: even though they didn't necessarily perform.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they noticed that the pickup time and the erection was getting better\n\nSpeaker 1: because the body learned and registered the trigger from the medicine\n\nSpeaker 2: and started acting because basically you push your body\n\nSpeaker 1: to do what it's supposed to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's a little trick here as well with the pill you already have\n\nSpeaker 1: that you could try.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just from feedback that I have that I can share with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can micro-dose it, take half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then in three days you take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then over time the body is going to kind of have that mechanism,\n\nSpeaker 2: be familiar with that mechanism.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because sometimes it doesn't work because the body doesn't understand\n\nSpeaker 2: what's happening, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: And some people react better as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to cancel the order that you sent me\n\nSpeaker 1: and just put the money back in my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, when you get it, just return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get it, just return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to refund you, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's in Texas already.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's in Fort Worth, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just write refuse return on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the two words you've got to put the amendment.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to take that back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And do you want me to pause your prescription so you don't lose it\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I was asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: I heard that part, but I was saying,\n\nSpeaker 2: do you want me to pause it so you don't lose your price?\n\nSpeaker 1: You just don't receive anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in the future, if anything is different,\n\nSpeaker 2: at least you can access a good deal, a decent price,\n\nSpeaker 1: and get your pill once or twice a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: but no more 25 pill every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we'll just pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I said, what you have, try to microdose it\n\nSpeaker 2: just to kind of get you going in your system,\n\nSpeaker 1: and over time, the medicine tends to pick up\n\nSpeaker 2: and be more connected with the body chemistry that you have,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you might see that things are working a little better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have patients telling me stuff like that,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I just want to share that.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you know, I'll be happy to have you calling,\n\nSpeaker 1: telling me that that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: So when it gets here, I just write refuse on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, refuse return on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to give you money that wasn't ready,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're taking a break to try the first 25\n\nSpeaker 2: and see if you can make them work.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll pause the account so you don't lose your current deal,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can reorder your 10 pill once or twice a year\n\nSpeaker 1: to lock that price in, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: But you don't necessarily need 25 every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to do that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, they didn't send none last month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the reason is because 25...\n\nSpeaker 2: This is January.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason is because 25, you cannot get 25 for 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got to be, like, 45 days by the law.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get 40 pills, you cannot get it every month,\n\nSpeaker 1: even if you wanted to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got to get it every 3 months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there is limitation.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only one you can get every month is 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are potent medications, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: so we got to follow that line.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if you wanted to order a lot,\n\nSpeaker 1: we're not going to be able to.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have some limitations, you know, that we need to follow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, everything is paused, and then, you know...\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I changed the quantity.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to reorder, I put that, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you probably will need 10 instead of 25 in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you can change that, and it's not set in stone.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can change that to convenience.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want more, get more, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you are set.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then do that, write, refuse, return.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to get you a refund when we get that back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
