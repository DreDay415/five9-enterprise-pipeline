    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ronnie Bradford.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. And Mr. Bradford, let's take a look. We wanted to call about your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I please get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 78717.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 78717.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And are you at 16806 Village Oak Loop in Austin, Texas, Mr. Bradford?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. Sure am.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So you're checking up on your order. You placed the order today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No, I'm not checking on my order.\n\nSpeaker 2: This ain't on automatic where they send it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whenever I need it, I just go on and order it from you every time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely. So this is as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good. That's why I wanted to make sure I did it right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Just one quick thing, though, Mr. Bradford.\n\nSpeaker 1: To keep your prescription open, because the doctor writes out refills for these, but you get to order whenever you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you do need to place an order, give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we can place an order for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the easiest way to do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, just bear in mind, if after six months you do not order anything, you get one refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does charge you one refill to keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's it. Other than that, you don't get anything else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just order whenever you feel like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say that again. What did you say about in six months? What happens?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you do not order anything in six months, after six months, let's say August rolls around, and you've ordered nothing, right,\n\nSpeaker 2: the system will send you one refill to keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, you don't get anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Only if you do not order anything in six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: If somebody is out of order in six months, I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll probably order one just to keep it active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, that's it. That's basically it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Have a good day. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
