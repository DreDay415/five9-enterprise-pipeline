Have you ordered with us before?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm a member.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name is Newman. First name is David. Zip code is 21061.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, when I ordered these, I ordered T-A-D-A-L-A-F-I-L.\n\nSpeaker 2: D-A-L-A-F-I-L? Yeah, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, what they did last time, I kept them because they charged me a hundred and some dollars,\n\nSpeaker 2: when it's only supposed to be like $64 and change.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that happened back on November 21st, and they issued a refund of $46 back to you already during that time frame.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, they did. They said it was a glitch on their end, which is no problem. It happens.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, I'd like to order another cycle of 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. It's going to be a 6895 or a Billingman MasterCard that ends in 9649?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, it's the one followed.\n\nSpeaker 2: 6895, and it's going to, let me see here, 899 Gordon Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set. That order has been processed out. You'll receive it in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: If any questions come up whatsoever, feel free to reach out to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, I've got a question again. I didn't hear the amount. 60 what?\n\nSpeaker 2: $68.95, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6895. Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
