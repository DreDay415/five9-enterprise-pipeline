Okay, Bay City, Michigan, 1401 North Henry Street. Yes. All right. Looking for 40 pills again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Gotcha. Are we still charging on the Visa card ending in 9094 that expires on 11 of 27? Or do we need a new card?\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a new card, but I don't have it with me right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Like at all, you don't have it with you? Or do you just need to go downstairs and get it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, somebody took it, and they're gone. I don't know when they'll be back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Give us a call either later today. We're here for like another hour and a half today. If not, call us tomorrow morning, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. All right. All right, brother. Thank you.",
