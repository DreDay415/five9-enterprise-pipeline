    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Raymond Nati. Yes, hi. My name is Raymond Nati, and I'm calling in regards – I got a statement from PayPal, and I'm a little confused.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was told when I first ordered ScoreBlue Viagra from you guys,\n\nSpeaker 2: they never told me that I was on a recurrent order,\n\nSpeaker 1: where they'll be charging me and sending me stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: When they sent me something which wasn't right,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they sent me the right one that had the AG something, whatever, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when I called NAC Emerson, I don't worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not on a recurrent charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: The problem you call in when you need it, you place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I just got a notification on the 26th I was charged $63 for something I never ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, hmm, that's weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: They never told me I was locked into something because I still have POS left.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, why would they send this or charge my PayPal account when I never placed an order?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I was hoping someone can help me with that and find out is this accurate,\n\nSpeaker 2: is I'm locked into something because I never signed up for nothing like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought I can call in and place an order.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you absolutely can call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just need to adjust it properly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Regarding the prescription as a whole, Ray,\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to be able to pull up your account to more accurately give you some information.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you provide me with your full name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me, I have your full name, excuse me, Ray, and then just your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my full name is Raymond Nottie, N-O-T-T-I-E, date of birth 2-27-70.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I see the initial prescription for the 50 mg Viagra was back in July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then that was the incorrect medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then they sent you replacements in August for a quantity of 10 of the 50 mg Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then they recommended you toss the old ones, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so then you had 10 pills and that was about 5 months ago, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so this is what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when they wrote your new script, for some reason that date reset, okay,\n\nSpeaker 2: to keep the prescription active and the refill went through on the 26th.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we have a few options that we can do here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that one was already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Looks like it is set to be arrived on the 2nd.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want it, okay, you can simply put a return to sender, RTS, on that label.\n\nSpeaker 1: And once that's filed back with us, you'll be issued a refund, right, to your PayPal.\n\nSpeaker 2: And PayPal, it is convenient because the refund is immediate, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then that being said, though, the prescription as a whole, right,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you wanted, we could put this on a pause and then that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, an order would need to be placed before August 1st to keep it active.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that gives you 6 months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So after, let's say, after 6 months and I don't, then I need to re-register or something like that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, go ahead and put that on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So once the post office sends it to me and wherever it comes, it is sent to the post office,\n\nSpeaker 2: I will take it back to the post office and have them to return.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you return it, it would close out the prescription, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you're going to return it, I'm just going to cancel it out and then you can call and place orders in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So great.\n\nSpeaker 2: That covered it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess I misunderstood and now that you made it more clear, that makes more sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if it says, do it through the post office, I keep my eyes open, excuse me,\n\nSpeaker 1: for the postman who comes by and I interact with him and then that is a return item.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that all I need to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. I appreciate you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
