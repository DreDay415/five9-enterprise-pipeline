    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. How are you doing, sir? My name is Angel Velez and I want to cancel\n\nSpeaker 2: my subscription to Scorablue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay Mr. Angel, you have a prescription for Viagra 100mg written by Dr. Bottoni on 30 day supply, 25 pills. You just don't need\n\nSpeaker 2: the refill or any health concern or you want to order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well what happened was $113 went out of my account recently and I got the pills and I had totally forgot about\n\nSpeaker 2: that, that I had to, I ordered the first time and I still had pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Makes sense, you don't need refill for a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, right exactly. So take me off the concurrent one and I'll\n\nSpeaker 1: go back and I'll order when I'm done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to advise the pharmacy to stop the original prescription for every month refill and then they're going\n\nSpeaker 1: to pause the prescription so you're going to order as needed so that way they don't\n\nSpeaker 2: have to pay for a new doctor consultation when you reorder and they don't have to charge\n\nSpeaker 1: you a new price either, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly. So I'm going to advise them to stop, you have\n\nSpeaker 1: pill left and then they're going to pause the prescription. Usually they pause up to\n\nSpeaker 2: half a year because monthly is not required anyway and then you can order once or twice\n\nSpeaker 1: a year maybe.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll do it on my own, yeah that'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me put you on a brief hold.",
