    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Keith Hilliard for Pfizer-Score Blue. I don't see who's calling, but I'm going to use this number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, sir. I'm going to use your number to look up your chart, pull up your account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm going to have you verify some things so I can help you put a stop to this. All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So when I pull this up, Robert, wait a minute. Actually, we've been working together.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: People call it – yeah, people usually call it because they don't want the marketing drips on the text.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me read what I see. But how's everything going? Thanks for calling back, Rob.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Everything is not going so good. The product is good. Your product is good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't get me wrong. I just don't have – I have a little bit of a financial difficulty.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you guys tried to make the charge for this month, it came up as insufficient funds because I don't have the money in my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need to – go ahead. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so I said, no, no, no worries. Let's help you. I'll help you out, but I'm always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the last time we ever charged you was in 6-22.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, but there was an attempt to charge on my account like a day or two ago, and it was – it came up as insufficient.\n\nSpeaker 2: To me, I got a notification to charge with the client because I didn't have enough in the account to cover it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so let me actually see. I don't see – honestly, let me just – let's just bear with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me try to just type in your name and see if you have another account with us somewhere.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on. Sometimes people have two accounts, Rob. Let me just type you in. Robert Ingram.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for calling in, bud, and asking for me. Did you use my extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, actually, the woman I was speaking to said, hey, let me get you over to the guy you spoke to before.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was like, okay. I mean –\n\nSpeaker 1: Slicksters, huh? No, it's okay. I would rather – yeah, I would rather deal with all the people I've ever touched and put my fingers on.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me just bear with me. So when I'm looking at it, bud, and I'm seeing it, everything I see is on your dashboard, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll show you when you get off the call because it sounds like you're driving, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me just share with you. On June 22nd, you ordered 20 pills. You did a 10-pill upgrade. It was $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And for 10 pills, it's 70% off. It's $29.40. So when you go to scoreblue.com and you log in with your Gmail account, there's a category that says Receipts.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see everything there that you ever had. When you called in and we spoke, I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I made it where we will revisit this because you're testing out the product and all that, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't have to worry about any charges. I don't know where that's coming from because it's definitely not us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It said on the email that it was a scoreblue charge. So that's why I'm calling you guys back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I had thought there was a hold on it, and the woman who switched me over to you said, no, there was only a six-month hold on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was like, okay, well, I don't know if that's what we discussed, but okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I did is when I paused it, what it does is it's not a hold. I paused it, and then I set up your dashboard where you can have more control to click it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you click it, it pushes the timer out another six months. So there are no charges at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's not going to happen if you click that button, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so this is what I got. I got an email from the bank saying scoreblue LLC for $63.95, Thursday, January 22nd.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was declined. They didn't pay the charge because I had insufficient funds in the account to cover it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know. Let me just do my due diligence. Let me put you on a brief hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll walk around to the, what is it called, to the admin team, and then I'll ask the admin team about this to go on the back end and see on their side if there's anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got an email, all right? Bear with me real quick, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stay with me, all right? Just drive safe. I don't want you to crash or anything. Health is wealth, bud, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Health is wealth.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment. Standby.",
