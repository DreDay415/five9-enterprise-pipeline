I want to make sure it's going to stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you need an Rx number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what was your last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: My last name is Doering, spelled D-E-A-R-I-N-G.\n\nSpeaker 1: First name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Peter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Peter, and you said you wanted to get this thing stopped?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, quite frankly, I don't know how it happened. I got some shipment in the other day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got an order and it just kept coming?\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 1: You got an order and a few more just showed up?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't really recall, to tell you the truth. So I got this without realizing it was coming. I don't really need any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, have you been charging me for this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you definitely were charged for it, $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95, that's ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get these through my – go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if you don't want to keep it, you definitely can send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause the account for you if you did want to place orders in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should be getting our new Viagra AGB, which other doctors definitely aren't able to prescribe.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're the only FDA-approved vendor of that medicine, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you want, like I said, I can pause it for you, Peter.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you did want to cancel, I can help you out with that as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just won't be able to fill these orders from you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just won't be able to fill these orders from you in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, we are the only FDA-approved company that gets these pills from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, kind of hard to hear and I can't hear you well.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can or cannot cancel for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I was letting you know, we are the only FDA-approved company that sells this medicine.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you get it from your doctor, it could be coming from China or India or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just want to make you aware before I finalize the cancel for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm aware of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm taking care of that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you are all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to get anything else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Peter?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any way to get a confirming email or something on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can send you a confirmation email.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll see that come by in just the next minute or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
