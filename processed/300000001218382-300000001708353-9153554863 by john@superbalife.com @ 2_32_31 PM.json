help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'd like to place an order of the pills, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, have you ordered before?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just sent an email this weekend, and I got an answer from you guys yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, did it tell you just to call?\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 2: What did they tell you, to call us to order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, they gave me all the specifications of the item and the prices.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the advertisement they sent me, there's this phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can give you my email so you can look for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that would be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just want to look for the email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's J-O-Y, Joy, Rivas, R-I-V-S-M-V-I-C-T-O-R-A-S-4774 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I see what they – okay, yes, those prices are all accurate.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, if you want to get signed up, I'm happy to get you signed up, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just takes a couple minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got to ask you some basic questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what is your first name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Carlos, C-A-R-L-O-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is Rivas your last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6-20-55.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-0-2-4-2.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the next part I've got to ask you just some basic medical questions,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we'll place your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long have you been concerned about\n\nSpeaker 1: or wanted to improve the hardness and duration of your erections?\n\nSpeaker 2: Less than three months, three to six months, seven to 12 months,\n\nSpeaker 1: one to two years, or more than two years?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say that again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: The connection is cutting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long have you been concerned about\n\nSpeaker 2: or wanted to improve the hardness and duration of your erections?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go outside because the signal is real weak here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I bet you can understand what you say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's try it right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long have you been worried about having ED?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you ever gotten this medicine from a doctor before?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: When was the last time you had a physical?\n\nSpeaker 1: Less than a year, less than three years, between three and five,\n\nSpeaker 2: or more than five?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything was okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your blood pressure, is it normal, elevated, high, very high,\n\nSpeaker 1: or normally low?\n\nSpeaker 2: Normal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Normal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you take any prescription medications?\n\nSpeaker 2: Cholesterol.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it atorvastatin that you take?\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it atorvastatin?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know what it's called?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't, but it's just over-the-counter medicine I take.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, is it over-the-counter or is it prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, over-the-counter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't take anything prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That clears it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have any allergies, sir, that you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, not at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Only a few questions left.\n\nSpeaker 2: In the past few months, have you passed out, had dizziness, seizures, or chest pains?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two left.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the last few months, have you used any of the following, methamphetamine,\n\nSpeaker 2: marijuana, poppers, heroin, molly, or cocaine?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a little.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last one is a list of medical conditions.\n\nSpeaker 1: You seem to be in good health, so I don't know if you have any,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if you hear one, stop me, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, vascular disease, emotional problems, hormone problems,\n\nSpeaker 1: kidney disease, neurological problems, trauma or injury to your penis, pelvis,\n\nSpeaker 2: perineum, testes, or rectum, prostate problems, urinary problems, sleep apnea,\n\nSpeaker 1: chronic fatigue or weakness, retinitis pigmentosa, a significant bend in your penis,\n\nSpeaker 2: pain with an erection, problems ejaculating not related to hardness, cancer,\n\nSpeaker 1: radiation of your bladder, prostate, or rectum, unexplained weight loss,\n\nSpeaker 2: joint pain, sexually transmitted disease, heart disease, or urological surgeries.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on your Pilser, what package did you want to get, the 10, 25, or 40?\n\nSpeaker 2: The 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, in 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is going to be the first time I've ever bought them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I used to get one spoon.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if it's your first time, the doctors usually suggest start at 50,\n\nSpeaker 1: so do you want to start there?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the middle of the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the milligrams of those?\n\nSpeaker 2: 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you needed to take two, you could, but it just would be 50 instead of a full 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to go with 25 of the 50s?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, go ahead like this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to hire one in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if it doesn't work properly, you say I can take two of them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can take a second one if it's not working how you want it to.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do you recommend?\n\nSpeaker 1: What I would recommend, the 50 is good because then you can take a 50 and you see if that's going to work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it feels like you need a little more power, we'll just up your prescription on the next refill to be for 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the 50 and the 100, both of them are the same price?\n\nSpeaker 2: They're the same price, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's go with 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can also cut those in half if you want, so that's another option.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was thinking that for the first time I'm going to cut one of them in half, try it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if it's not enough, I'm going to do the second one, but the next time I'm going to do the whole pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's smart.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you do need 50s, you can double your pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Carlos.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your address, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you said 8325 Everest Street, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: 8325, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just wanted to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I will take your card when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's going to be 4147-4004-8380-0270.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: 1130.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 110.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your order went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: This will be approved by a doctor here in California over the next day,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then once you're approved, we'll mail it out to your home directly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set and good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get an email updating you as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how long it will take?\n\nSpeaker 1: Approximately a week or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's usually from the day you order it to the day you receive it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's usually about seven days or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes it's a little faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be waiting for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day, sir.",
