    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi there. I canceled my subscription through email and I guess you guys wanted me to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys and ask for a reason why am I canceling?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we don't cancel over email because it could be somebody's wife trying to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: On your behalf. We have it all the time. We try to cancel over email and the guy never.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wants to cancel in the first place so it's a whole discrepancy thing so we'd rather.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everybody just call in and confirm everything over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I have Benedict Bisling in Frisco, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It does look like you are a VIP member here. Do you just not need the pills as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: As you've been getting them?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no. I'm taking some heart medication. My doctor told me to stop taking anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Other than what they gave me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Okay. Does he want you off of everything for the time being?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I'll resume it later. I'll call you guys back in a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. If you'd like, I can pause everything for half a year. We won't charge you or send.\n\nSpeaker 2: You anything and then whenever he gives you the green light, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, just cancel it for now because I might forget.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. If you're able to write it down, I mean, it'd be for August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Say that again?\n\nSpeaker 2: August 1st.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's okay. Go ahead and cancel it for now, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. All right. Good luck. Good luck in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.",
