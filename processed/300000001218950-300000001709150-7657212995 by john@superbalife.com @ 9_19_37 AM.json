How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Matt Winslow, and I ordered some pills several weeks ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they wanted to know what kind of medication I was on. They emailed me. I filled it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Twice. I sent them a photo of my prescription bottle, and they still tell me I'm not filling out the stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm like, I don't know what more—\n\nSpeaker 2: I need your zip code.\n\nSpeaker 1: 46135.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got you, so I—\n\nSpeaker 2: See, where you answered, if you didn't answer in the email, which is where we were asking for, but I got it here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take care of it for you, the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I even thinking, but let me finish speaking. Where you sent it to is directly to the doctor. The pharmacy also needs to know this—\n\nSpeaker 2: Information. They don't see where you sent it to, so when they emailed you, it's so we could tell the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm telling the pharmacy right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, and I—they call—I called them and talked to them. I've sent them—\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent them some stuff too, and I—the doctor—\n\nSpeaker 2: Messaged me. I—I understand. I just explained it, where you sent your response. Hey, you don't have to get angry with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm the one spending the money.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't raise your voice at me ever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Explained it. You don't understand it. Have a good day.",
