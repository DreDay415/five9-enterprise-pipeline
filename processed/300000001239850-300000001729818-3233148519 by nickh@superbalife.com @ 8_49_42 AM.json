These are adjustable prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's just see what happened with yours\n\nSpeaker 2: and why you got yours monthly, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So can I get your full name, Mr. Jameson,\n\nSpeaker 2: and your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: My first name is Louis, L-O-U-I-S.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name Jameson, J-A-M-I-S-O-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Date of birth is July 7, 1952.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so I'm looking at the prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: We usually order January 7 for the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 milligrams, quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ah, okay. All right, so I see what happened here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the doctor, Dr. Thomas Petone,\n\nSpeaker 2: wrote your prescription with refills\n\nSpeaker 1: due to the low milligram dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why you saw it go through the following month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so, Mr. Jameson, you're not required\n\nSpeaker 2: or obligated to get these every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a prescription, not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you wanted, you could retain access\n\nSpeaker 1: to the remaining refills under the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: which I see here are 10 refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted, you could just pause it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then that would allow you to call in\n\nSpeaker 1: and place orders as needed,\n\nSpeaker 2: should you want the prescription in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, on cancellation, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that's why I just wanted to make sure,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because you can either cancel it or pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Canceling it closes out the prescription altogether,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you would lose access to the remaining refills\n\nSpeaker 2: under the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any future orders would require a new health consultation survey\n\nSpeaker 2: and separate approval by doctor, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'll take care of that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
