    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey Quinn, this is Tom Rattigan calling. You and I talked about a week ago, a week and a half ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: You sent me some more pills because the ones that I got weren't working for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just want to let you know that the ones that you sent also aren't working for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's pull up your account and see what's going on, see how I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'd say your name is Tom, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Tom Rattigan, R-A-T-T-I-G-A-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty, and you said the new pills wasn't working either, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I think I had just two obes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Tom, I mean, we got guys well into their 90s, not necessarily an AIDS thing, it could be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, but were you taking it on an empty stomach, that is the question?\n\nSpeaker 1: I take them in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you are taking them on an empty stomach and you're taking them before you actually have the intercourse, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alright, well, yeah, I understand. And you have tried Cialis before?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, Cialis you said?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, have you ever tried that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you have like the same reaction?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, because usually that's a good indication that something's kind of blocking maybe, you know, something's blocking the medication from actually working.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've taken two or three Cialis pills at a time. Not just the one, but two or three. And it's just not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's not the amount, it's just generally if you take Cialis and you have tried Viagra and they're not working,\n\nSpeaker 1: then it's usually a good indication that something in your body is blocking it. No matter how much of it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a good indication that if both of those aren't working, that it's something else that's the culprit that's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you may want to go get that checked out. I'm not sure if you want to, but you know, it's always a good idea if these are both not working for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: to go get something checked out because it could be something blocking it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty. Well, I mean, if you want, we do have a supplement that helps with that, but that would be totally up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is something I could send for free, but like I said, that's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll try anything just to see, you know, what happens. If you want to do that, do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had ordered 20 to begin with. I still have 18 left and the one that you just sent, I have out of the 10, I still have 9 left.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So what this is, it's called an activator. Basically, what it is is a supplement.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's just something that you would, it's a 30-day run of it. You just take two every day in the morning when your body's absorbing it the most.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you would still take the Viagra as needed, but you don't want to take these together.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just want to take these when you wake up, get in your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, the longer you take it, the more it's going to build up in your system.\n\nSpeaker 1: So like I said, it's like a 30-day dosage. I definitely want to use it for about three weeks before you see the results from the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I said, I'm going to send that out to you now. Don't worry. And then try that with what you already have.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you got my number and my extension there, so you can call me back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully, this does work for you. If it doesn't, then I'll go ahead and take care of this stuff for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Well, like I said, I'd rather have the monkey than the money, so I'll try anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I am trying to help you out there, so don't worry. And this is all free, too, so I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. Okay. I look forward to it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome, sir. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
