    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Steve Lemay. I just received an order from Score Blue. I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got one. It didn't work. I thought I canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can take a look and see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay. Well, if it's not working, sir, you know, we can always send you some more for free\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if that's working for you better, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to cancel automatically at all, sir. You can choose when you get your orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's up to you. You don't have to get them when you're not ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to return what I got or do I have to get these?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's up to you, sir, but, I mean, if they're not working,\n\nSpeaker 2: why would you not want to try something else for free?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I want to give you these back. I haven't opened them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I took them out of the package, but I didn't open them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was asking about sending you something for free, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do understand you have those and they're not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're on the same page.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to send you some more for free to see if they work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not going to bill you or send you anything else until we find something to work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's a different one?\n\nSpeaker 1: This would be a different manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is going to be our AGV that comes from France,\n\nSpeaker 1: not the one that was in America, the one that you received.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure if you're aware how Viagra works.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a vasomedication, which is about moving blood flow through your body,\n\nSpeaker 2: which ultimately gives you an erection.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very, very subject to body chemistry.\n\nSpeaker 1: So certain pills, this pill, just seems like it's not a good fit for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why we do offer, we'll send you another one for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's usually the case. This will be a better fit for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a different manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually it is the case that you're trying to find something that fits best for your body,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is why, like I said, we won't send you this one anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll stop the billing, and we'll send you this one more for free of the newest stuff we have.\n\nSpeaker 2: All we do is ask that you give me a phone call.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give you my extension and let me know if it's working for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: When it is, you can let me know when you'd like to receive it or order as needed, whatever you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, if I've already got one shipment, this is a second shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to return the second shipment unopened.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that possible?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine. That is totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to try this new stuff or not?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try it one time, yeah, the new stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll still send you this back for credit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, if it works, I mean, if I send you the new stuff and it actually works, which more than likely it will,\n\nSpeaker 1: I could just simply replace it with the stuff that works for you so you don't have to worry about shipping that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll use the same value that you paid, and I'll send you more bills.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's no reason keeping this bottle because it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I've gone through the first bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just listen to me, sir. Just listen.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I said that when I send you the new pills, if the new pills work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: then I would simply just tell you I'll throw those away,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we will replace the money that you spent with the stuff that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're not going to reship you the stuff that's not working.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to send you more of the pills that are working for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that way you don't have to worry about shipping those back and dealing with all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you're more than willing to. You can.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm just letting you know that it is okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't mind exchanging and swapping those out for the ones that actually work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you can just send them back, sir. We'll give you your money. It's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll send them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, just send them back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I need an RF, a return authorization number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no. I don't need any of that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't send any kind of return slips or anything like that either.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got an address of shipping manager 525 Alexandria Pike, Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I return it to there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that what I send it back to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That will do. I appreciate the help.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good day.",
