    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, how are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, good afternoon. I'm doing okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Iswar Prasad.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you, sir? Yes, sir. How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my credit card. Just call me and say you got to take out $163 and charge my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I did not order anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me see what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what happened was, from what I can see, Mr. Iswar, you got a refill with your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you don't need it, you can return it. It got delivered yesterday in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: I pick up mail right now, but I did not receive anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my credit card company just called me and told me I got a charge for $163.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, for what?\n\nSpeaker 1: If somebody answers your mail, because the person who said they delivered yesterday at 12.35 p.m.,\n\nSpeaker 2: did somebody have access to your mailbox?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, only me and my wife here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And she's sick. She's sick. She cannot go outside. Only me. I pick up the mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, I mean, try to look around, I don't know if you can, or check.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a tracking number. Are you sure it was delivered?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can return it and we can refund you. That's not a problem. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I didn't order anything. Why you guys charge me credit card?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what happened was, so when you got your original prescription, the doctor writes the prescription with refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you had your pills in October, so it would generate three months later.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when they write refill, it's for you to not call and ask for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: They assume you're active. If you're not active now, you call saying,\n\nSpeaker 1: hey, you know what, I don't need much, you know, pause my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So now you can order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Initially, they assumed that you need Viagra, you need ED medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they sent you your refill three months later, thinking that you're running out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now that you're saying that, hey, I don't need refill like that, I can have the pharmacy pausing\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can order as needed. You can even order less.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can order 10 pills once or twice a year if you're not that active. You know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I have. Can you cancel that order for me, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to tell the pharmacy to pause\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can just order as needed. So they're not going to send you a refill, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can get 10 pills once or twice a year. Order some.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, but what will happen to my $163 now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I was saying, because there's a tracking number, I can provide it in your email\n\nSpeaker 2: so you will see what I'm talking about. They say it was delivered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just return that and you're going to get your refund. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I just pick up mail, but I didn't see nothing inside my mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, who is accessing your mailbox? Because I can't give you a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Office of Federal Administration says that you received the mail at 12.30 yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I went to work yesterday. I come home. I pick up mail. I didn't see anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just pick up mail and then my credit card just calls me and tells me I have charged $163.\n\nSpeaker 1: I say, for what? And then they tell me, so I call this number.\n\nSpeaker 2: They give me this number to call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Yes, so like I said, there's a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you can ask maybe in your building, I don't know who is managing,\n\nSpeaker 1: but they said it was delivered so you can get your refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to refund you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I find this stuff now, what will happen?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to have to talk to my manager.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually you just have to return to get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't return, I'm going to have to have them have the permission\n\nSpeaker 1: and see what's going on, explain the situation.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the tracking number shows it was delivered to your address yesterday at 12.35 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's from the Post Office themselves, Administration.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent an update. There was a tracking number available that I can give you over the phone\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can see what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Hold on. Can you write down this tracking number for me, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you cancel everything from my name, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You don't want to reorder in the later future?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I need later future, I will call you guys back.\n\nSpeaker 1: But right now I cannot do anything, man, because my wife is in the hospital.\n\nSpeaker 2: And she just got home right now. And I am taking care of she.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, of course. So what we're going to do, we're going to pause you.\n\nSpeaker 2: They pause you up to half a year so you don't get monthly anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can reorder yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way when you reorder, you don't pay a more expensive price\n\nSpeaker 1: because they've got to get you a new doctor consultation. Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. But you think I can get back my $163?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, absolutely. Just get the tracking number, check it for me, and then call me back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to also talk to my manager and let him check in your property.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get your money back. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: We just got to be able to see if you can find at least the package\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's a lot of pills, 40 pills. You know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get your money. No problem, sir. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you give me the tracking number, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's 9400...\n\nSpeaker 2: 9400...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, 1362...\n\nSpeaker 2: 13...\n\nSpeaker 1: 62?\n\nSpeaker 2: 62?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0769...\n\nSpeaker 2: 0769...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9276...\n\nSpeaker 1: 9276...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2851...\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: What...\n\nSpeaker 2: What is this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Where did you stop?\n\nSpeaker 2: The 7-6.\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-6?\n\nSpeaker 2: 28...\n\nSpeaker 1: 2851...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-6.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-6?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, 9400...\n\nSpeaker 2: 1362...\n\nSpeaker 1: 0769...\n\nSpeaker 2: 9276...\n\nSpeaker 1: 285196.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on. Hold on, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9400...\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: 13...\n\nSpeaker 2: 13...\n\nSpeaker 1: 62?\n\nSpeaker 2: 62?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0769...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9276...\n\nSpeaker 1: 9276...\n\nSpeaker 2: 2851...\n\nSpeaker 1: 2851...\n\nSpeaker 2: And 9-6.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-6.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, um...\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to have the pharmacy pausing so that way, um...\n\nSpeaker 1: you don't have to pay a more expensive price because the company got to get you a new doctor consultation, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You lock your price in and that allows you to not get monthly refill anymore, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you can get 10 pills once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Um...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because, uh, my wife gets sick, you know, at work, and right now I'm the only son-in-law to pay the bill, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't afford to pay all this money, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to close you for half a year, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that way, you still have the opportunity to reorder at the same price, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Ollie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ollie?\n\nSpeaker 1: Ollie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call us, uh, you know, if, you know, in June, if things are still complicated, just call us, let us know what's going on or place your order, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But just check that tracking number and see if you can't find those pills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to refund you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not forgetting about you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just, just help us and find those 40 pills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just write refuse return on the package so you can send that back and then, you know, we're going to get you your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing to worry about, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give us a call back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
