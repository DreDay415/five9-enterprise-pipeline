    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I just received my prescription today, but I don't want to take this stuff anymore. It's got too many side effects. I tried taking one and I didn't even get any results on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay sir, so let's pull up your prescription and see what's going on here and what you received. Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Jeffrey D. Embry, 4761.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I see the prescription here is for the 100 mg generic sidenafil. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Did you want to try the Viagra AGV, which has less side effects, or did you just want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I could send you a sample of that for free if you want to try those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll try it, but I want to cancel this one. It has too many side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, so like I said, here at Score Blue we sell multiple versions. There's the generic, there's the name brand Viagra, and then there's the AGV. The AGV is the newest formula, proven with little to no side effects compared to its predecessors.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you would like, I could put your account on a pause, so you won't get these monthly any longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll send you a trial for the 10 of the AGV. You try those out. I'll give you my extension. You could call me back if you want and let me know how you want to proceed, whether or not you want to cancel completely or have access to the AGVs in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the ones that you put under your tongue?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, those aren't FDA approved. No, we don't have those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, can you just cancel my prescription for this? I mean, I just got it today, and now I got... I'm getting charged for this, and I got 10 pills, and I'm not even going to take them. And this is probably like 70-something dollars right here I'm holding in my hand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so let me... That's what I was going to say. I mean, the AGVs are more effective, so I could just send you that to try. I can't send them to you when I cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can pause your account, right? So I can send them to you when I pause your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, just cancel it. Just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem, Jeff. So upon cancellation, the prescription is officially closed out. Any future prescriptions would require new and separate health survey, consultation, and approval, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you so much. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
