I'm pulling your prescription here, Mr. Blackstead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I see that you have a VIP account with Scoblew,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you'll be receiving Viagra, 50 mg, 10 tablets from Dr. Tariq every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need it as often, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. I'd rather just, when I need it, I would rather just redo it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm going to set you up this way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to cancel the original writing prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the doctor wrote it every 30 days because you order only 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to stop that, tell the pharmacy to stop,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're going to pause your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way, when you reorder, you don't pay a higher price\n\nSpeaker 2: because the company got to pay a new doctor evaluation for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can get it once or twice a year, but it's not going to be on the monthly anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay? So you can order and get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. That sounds good to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me advise the pharmacy right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please bear with me. I'm corresponding with the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Blackstead?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was able to advise the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to pause it for half a year, like I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order as needed. It's not going to be on a monthly basis anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay? And your price is locked in.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Consultation, prescription is available to you at any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can press quick refill button in your account, or you can call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'd be happy to hear from you as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sounds good. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Give us a call to reorder, and you have a great week.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
