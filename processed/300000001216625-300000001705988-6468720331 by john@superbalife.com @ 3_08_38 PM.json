I just updated the card and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what was the promotion I got for the Gender Promotion thing I have for the pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need your name and zip code real quick, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Name is Kelvin, K-E-L-V-I-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: And last name Wilkes, W-I-L-K-E-S.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And the zip?\n\nSpeaker 2: 11422.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. One second. I'm pulling up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. 133rd Ave. in Rosedale?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So the last time you ordered, you got five pills at $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: We've actually changed the plan, so you can get ten for that same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: We do have more than ten if you want to get that, but if you're looking to pay something similar, we can get you ten.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ten is good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ten is good? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You updated the card, so...\n\nSpeaker 2: The Discover card is the one you want me to use, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right. 0373.\n\nSpeaker 2: It did update properly, so I'll go ahead and charge that card for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You're getting ten of the AGV, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: These should ship out on Monday for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good luck with the storm that's coming through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Me, I just finished having a throat cut, but I won't be doing none of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm in the house for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, well...\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if it was going to snow you in any way, it doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I hope you recover well, sir, and you'll get these in about a week or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Appreciate you. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Bye-bye.",
