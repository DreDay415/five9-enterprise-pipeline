How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. I'm glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Steve?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to cancel my prescription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that. What is your date of birth, Steve?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5-15-72.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 204 Sterling Road, Hendersonville, Tennessee, 37075?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Yeah, so I see you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Well, just so you know, Steve, you do always have the option with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you don't want to receive those regular refills, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time,\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to place it on hold,\n\nSpeaker 2: but then you did want to order something within the next six months, you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I think I'd like to just go ahead and cancel it, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, and I'm having terrible headaches with them, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's completely understandable.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, well, yeah, if the prescription doesn't work for you and you're having side effects,\n\nSpeaker 1: then it makes sense that you don't need this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is my job to let you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do qualify, just because it looks like you haven't tried it,\n\nSpeaker 1: if your current prescription isn't working for you and it is giving you side effects,\n\nSpeaker 2: you qualify for a free sample of our newest, highest-quality product,\n\nSpeaker 1: which we have specifically formulated to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it comes directly from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is FDA-approved, third-party tested, all that good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's their fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my favorite thing about it is that it's been formulated to cut out those two side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if those are the ones that you experienced exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, and the free sample, it's 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way it would work is you want to think about it as kind of like a free trial\n\nSpeaker 1: where the prescription is started with the free sample of 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it's placed on hold for you until June while you try it out, make sure you love it,\n\nSpeaker 1: make sure you prefer it to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, and we believe that you'd give us a call at some point\n\nSpeaker 1: within the next two to five months to order some, and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if not, you'd just have that period, you'd have until June to let us know,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'd just have 10 free pills to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is a great prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's definitely a superior prescription to your current one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you did end up liking them, we would be willing to price match your old price\n\nSpeaker 2: if you did want to call in and order them at a later date.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I think I wouldn't be interested at this time, but I appreciate you telling me about it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if something changes, I may give you a call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we're always here, and we are the only sellers of that product in the world.\n\nSpeaker 2: We paid a lot of money with Pfizer to be able to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, keep us in mind at a later date, and you know where to find us,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'd love to have you back to order those.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample at a later date, but that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Steve, yeah, so your script is canceled, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thank you for your time. See you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
