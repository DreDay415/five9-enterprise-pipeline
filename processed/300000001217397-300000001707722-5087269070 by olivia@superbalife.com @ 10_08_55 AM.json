    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Tom Gordon, G-O-L-D-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Tom.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm calling to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Tom, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: April 16, 1948.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're located in Hingham, Massachusetts, 02043?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so do the pills, do they work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not really, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know, if the pills don't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do qualify, if you were interested,\n\nSpeaker 2: for a free sample of our newest, highest-quality product.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is a superior prescription to your current one.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is our fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it\n\nSpeaker 2: to cut out the side effects of the sinus agitation and the headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way it would work is it would be 10 pills total, the free sample,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it would come with kind of like a five-month trial where, obviously,\n\nSpeaker 1: you don't need your current script,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it would be replaced with this new one that is a free sample of 10 pills\n\nSpeaker 1: that is placed on hold for you until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: While you try it out, make sure you love it,\n\nSpeaker 1: make sure you prefer it to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we believe that you'd give us a call in the next two to five months\n\nSpeaker 2: to order some, and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And based off of the reviews and the data, we think that that's really likely.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if not, you just have 10 free pills until June to let us know one way\n\nSpeaker 2: or the other.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, I mean, they are great products,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're better products than your current script.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll try that as long as what I want to do right now is stop the billing\n\nSpeaker 2: that I have for my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I can get that free sample, and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: with the commitment that I call back within, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: whatever, two to five months, as you said,\n\nSpeaker 2: if I like it I get to start a new prescription with that particular product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are those the terms and conditions?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's 10 free pills, and then you have until June,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the other prescription is canceled out\n\nSpeaker 1: and basically replaced with this one that's placed on hold for you\n\nSpeaker 2: by the free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the only thing that would happen is if I did not call by June,\n\nSpeaker 2: that prescription would just automatically kick in for the new product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that what happens?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no, I don't have a problem with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all fine by me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you can also always, like, if you love the product, for instance,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you call us back in, like, two months, four months, whatever, to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can have the script set up the way you want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, if you don't need 10 pills every month,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to receive that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so can I ship this free sample to 35 Franklin Rogers Road\n\nSpeaker 1: in Hingham, Massachusetts, 02043?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send them out to you at 100 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's what you've already been approved for,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just sent them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they'll probably, I mean, you know, that snowstorm or cold storm\n\nSpeaker 2: or whatever pending, usually they would get to you in two to five business days,\n\nSpeaker 1: like maybe even by Wednesday, Thursday, but maybe it will be Friday, who knows.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then just a reminder, you want to take them on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you want to avoid alcohol and caffeine just because caffeine\n\nSpeaker 1: and alcohol restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you so much, Thomas.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And will I get a confirmation that my billing has ceased for this current prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I can send you an email if you like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the email we have on file is golden.tom at outlook.com, is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So look out in the next two minutes for an email from me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll start crafting it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys have a nice policy here.\n\nSpeaker 1: This kind of works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I get to end my billing, and I get another product to try,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if it works, I get to say, great, let's send it out to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good customer service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: We appreciate you, Tom, and I hope you love the product, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for taking my call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
