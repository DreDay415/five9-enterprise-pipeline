    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, this is Jimmy, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, how are you doing, Jimmy? My name is Raul Castillo and I think I ordered some Skor Blue and that was about in November or December.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got it in, they sent me another bottle, is this a subscription or what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me, let me pull up your account, Raul. I do see your account up there, it looks like that you're getting the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 mg and you do have a prescription, it looks like it's set up for every two months to come to you, is that too frequently?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because we can always push that back if it's happening too soon for you, that's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, actually I really don't need a subscription because it doesn't really help me, it gives me a lot of heartburn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it didn't work out for you? But look, let me do something for you, check it out, I do see that I have something I want to do for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just got one sent out to you just the other day with ship, what I'm going to do, I'm going to send out something even better than that one for you with no charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 25 of them, it's a new and improved Viagra that just came out and what it does, it doesn't have those same side effects that the old Viagra used to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me tell you what it's going to look like, it's going to be a white shaped diamond pill and it's going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's going to look very similar to what you've been getting, but it's going to have another 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to charge you for these because you just got the other subscription and I'm going to postpone any orders for you for like about four or five months to give you a chance to try these.\n\nSpeaker 2: To make sure that you don't have any bad reactions to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I'm going to also do, I'm going to set up so when you do call, these will be the ones you're going to get going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the back of the pill, it probably has some letters on the one you have, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It has some letters.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it has a number, it's not the 100 you're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why, okay, so you're going to, so like I said, again, what I just shipped out to you, that one's going to be the same thing you got now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you out one that's going to have the number 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the ones I want you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause your subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to get any more of those pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, again, I'm going to pause it out for like four or five months for you to give you a chance to try the ones I'm going to send you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to get the one I just mentioned, just went out, but it's the one with the 100 is the ones you want to look at and try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what is the price of those?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what, I'm going to keep it at the same price, this kind of price that you have, because you are VIP.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the first batch I'm sending you, I'm not charging you at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to, I just want you to try because you already paid for the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I want you, these I'm not charging you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're getting these for free to replace the ones that you were going to get.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I guarantee these are going to be the ones you're going to like.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of that for you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you forget that, remember, you're going to get the other ones and you're going to get the other ones right behind it because the other ones already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
