May I have the phone number you used for your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to assume it's my phone number of 606-521-0873.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Charles Anders?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so I see you have a VIP account with Scoreblue and you have a prescription from Dr. Tariq for 10 tablets, I think, every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the option, if you don't need those 30 days after initial writing, I can advise the pharmacy to stop the initial writing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're just going to order as needed, meaning that they pause the prescription. You can just call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead of updating that often, you're not required to do it on a monthly as well. It's based on your need, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I really just want to cancel it completely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just wanted to make sure to give you all the options because that allows you to lock your price in.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you cancel, because we're going to cancel that constitution they financed for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That being said, if you try to reorder in the future, be aware of price change because they're going to have to reinvest and get a new doctor evaluation for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why they give you the option to pause when you don't need charge, you don't need refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you can just order as needed and control your refill yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Like I said, I just want to cancel it completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I did already. I canceled the doctor prescription. I was canceling the VIP account while talking to you, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
