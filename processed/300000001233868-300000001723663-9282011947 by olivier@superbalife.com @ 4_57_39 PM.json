    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hello? Hello, are we speaking to Mr. David Lopez? Yes, you are speaking to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Him. Yes, the one and only. Actually, no, my son is also David Lopez. But there is—\n\nSpeaker 1: Only one original one, that's what I mean to say. Yes sir, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, in Kingsman, Arizona, I think. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes sir. Yeah, I see that you have a prescription, a VIP account with ScoreBlue, prescription hundred—\n\nSpeaker 2: Milligram, ten tablets every 30 days. How can I help you today, Mr. David? Well, I am—\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually going to cancel my prescription. Any health concern or you just want—\n\nSpeaker 2: To order as needed instead? Because you can do that too. Well, I just actually—\n\nSpeaker 1: Decided I don't need them and besides I have recently divorced and don't have a—\n\nSpeaker 2: Partner. Okay, yeah, I mean usually when things like that happen, I'm just passing—\n\nSpeaker 1: On to you what people do most, patient here. They pause the prescription so that—\n\nSpeaker 2: Way when they resume or if anything gets resolved or things get better, some—\n\nSpeaker 1: People even have medicals. When they try to reorder, they don't have to pay a—\n\nSpeaker 2: Higher price. They look at the current price because they save the prescription—\n\nSpeaker 1: So company because when the company got to pay again a doctor to evaluate you—\n\nSpeaker 2: That impacts your cost basically. So usually it's good to pause. They pause—\n\nSpeaker 1: You up to half a year and then the caveat is that if you get just ten pills—\n\nSpeaker 2: Twice a year, you stay at the same price point even if it's more—\n\nSpeaker 1: Expensive everywhere or whatever. So usually, you know, it's good to pause and—\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you can resume and order as needed. Basically just stop the monthly because—\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't need it. You don't need it every month. You're not active at the—\n\nSpeaker 2: Moment but, you know, at least you can have that in the future on deck if you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Need to. Well, that's a possibility but I just want to be certain that I will not—\n\nSpeaker 2: Be charged once again. I actually initially only thought and it was my—\n\nSpeaker 1: Mistake that I was only going to try them at that current price. I didn't—\n\nSpeaker 2: Realize that I had subscribed to a monthly subscription. Now it's not a—\n\nSpeaker 1: Subscription. It's a prescription with refills initially but then when you don't—\n\nSpeaker 2: Need a refill maybe you're not that active. You need it here and there. You—\n\nSpeaker 1: Can pause it and then resume and update your account. That way that just allows you—\n\nSpeaker 2: To keep your status and you don't have to pay a higher price when you reorder—\n\nSpeaker 1: And all that. So you can pause for now, like let's say you pause for—\n\nSpeaker 2: Half a year, you work on a couple stuff and then, you know, you might get your ten—\n\nSpeaker 1: Pills here and there. But you don't lose your status. You—\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't lose the price. You don't lose what you already started. You just—\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't get every single month because you're working on other stuff and you're—\n\nSpeaker 2: Not active. How can I be sure that I will not be sent anymore—\n\nSpeaker 1: Until I say so? Yes, so what you do, you pause the prescription. That's the only—\n\nSpeaker 2: Option I have here. I tried to do that on the online website because I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Signed in obviously and it was not working. So I don't know if that was a—\n\nSpeaker 2: Problem on my end or your end but I could not pause it on the website. Okay, I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Mean I don't know why, you know, some accounts need like a general update. We—\n\nSpeaker 2: Have an IT team but that's what we hear on the phone because what you're not—\n\nSpeaker 1: Able to do yourself online, we got to help you out. That's what we hear—\n\nSpeaker 2: On the phone as support, right? So but like I said, you know, I would—\n\nSpeaker 1: Personally advise to pause your prescription for now and then, you know—\n\nSpeaker 2: At least you can work on what you need to work on and see what's going on and—\n\nSpeaker 1: You can always call and make an update to the account, you know what I mean, or place—\n\nSpeaker 2: An order here and there once or twice a year but not every single month—\n\nSpeaker 1: Obviously, you know. Okay, as long as that's an absolute and I don't have to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Worry about a charge of $49 because that can hurt me financially if I'm not—\n\nSpeaker 1: Prepared. Yeah, no, I understand. Like I said, they can pause you up to half a—\n\nSpeaker 2: Year and you can call and let us know, you know, all things going, you know, if—\n\nSpeaker 1: You still want to keep your prescription for Viagra or what's going—\n\nSpeaker 2: On, you want to reorder 10 pills, you know, stuff of that nature because when you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Lose what you have here. Okay, cool. You might feel like, oh, you know what, I'm—\n\nSpeaker 2: Doing something for myself but it catches on to you later because when you're—\n\nSpeaker 1: Going to reorder in the future, the price you're not going to be the same and any—\n\nSpeaker 2: Other ED as well on the market, the price not going to be the same. So if you don't order from us—\n\nSpeaker 1: Everywhere is going to be the same scenario if you see what I'm saying, you—\n\nSpeaker 2: Know. I got your idea. I understand. Okay. I don't mind either or. I'm just passing—\n\nSpeaker 1: Information. No, that makes a lot of—that makes a lot of sense and I know, I know—\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't matter to you. Agreed. Okay, for starters, can I pause it for an—\n\nSpeaker 1: Indefinite amount of time? So you're going to hold it for half a year and that's it for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay, well, you know what, in that case, I'm just going to—\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm canceling the prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, please do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I cancel the prescription here, cancel the VIP account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, when you pause, let's say if you were doing that, even when you get your 10 pills half a year, you don't—\n\nSpeaker 1: Get back on a monthly anyway, you know. 10 pills half a year, another half a year—\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 pills just to keep you on a current market price but that's about it. It's not—\n\nSpeaker 1: Going to be on a monthly unless you reinstated the monthly, that's what I was—\n\nSpeaker 2: Trying to tell you but yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's the important part as I don't want that—\n\nSpeaker 2: To happen monthly and by the way, I was able to break the tablet in half and—\n\nSpeaker 1: Only took 50 milligrams as opposed to the entire 100 and it flushed my face tremendously.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it is and it did not work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you could be a—\n\nSpeaker 1: Cialis person, you could have told me that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, Cialis I have taken.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's good?\n\nSpeaker 2: And yeah, and that actually did not work well at all either, to be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I have high blood pressure, yeah, and I'm fearful for them because it—\n\nSpeaker 2: It made my face extremely hot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand that definitely. Maybe you—\n\nSpeaker 2: Want to take a break and move stuff around, maybe see the doctor, see what's—\n\nSpeaker 1: Because usually either or will work. One of them should work at least.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I would like to see my cardiologist soon. In fact, I have an—\n\nSpeaker 1: Appointment in March but I'm just gonna go ahead and cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I did already.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, it's canceled and that'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you all say okay. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, all right, you have a nice evening.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too as well. Bye bye.",
