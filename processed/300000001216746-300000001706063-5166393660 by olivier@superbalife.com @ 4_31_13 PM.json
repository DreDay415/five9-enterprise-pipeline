    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Yeah, I was told to call this number because you guys initiated a\n\nSpeaker 2: prescription that I didn't authorize.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me put a prescription in here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. James Einhorn?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. From what I can see, you got a prescription for Dr. Mayers\n\nSpeaker 2: for 50 milligram, 25 tablets Viagra. I think from what I can see what happened\n\nSpeaker 1: was the doctor wrote it for you to get a refill, I think every 45 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, but I had called up and asked to take me off of auto refill. I don't need auto refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just call you when I need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm gonna advise the pharmacy to\n\nSpeaker 1: stop the 45 days refill so that way you can order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because that's\n\nSpeaker 1: the initial writing from the doctor but it's not a requirement. You know, I mean\n\nSpeaker 2: okay, so if you have enough left there is no reason to send you more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, you gotta finish what you have first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so I'm gonna advise the pharmacy to pause so\n\nSpeaker 1: that way you kind of lock your price in. You don't pay a new price when you\n\nSpeaker 2: reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think they pause up to half a year so you don't have no more monthly\n\nSpeaker 2: anymore and you can order as needed. Maybe you can order once or twice a year\n\nSpeaker 1: to lock your price in but not anymore every 30 days. You know, I mean so\n\nSpeaker 2: okay, yeah let me do that for you. Give me one moment I'm corresponding with the\n\nSpeaker 1: pharmacy real quick. I'm gonna place you on a refill.",
