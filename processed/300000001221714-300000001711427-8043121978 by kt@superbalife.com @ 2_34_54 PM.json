    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Calvin?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, bud, I did three things for you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did exactly what you wanted, and I did a little bit more to put a smile on your face\n\nSpeaker 1: and spring in your step, but take down my telephone number, my extension, bud, so you\n\nSpeaker 2: don't have to deal with anyone anymore and get weighed on hold and get passed around,\n\nSpeaker 1: bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension, let me know when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is KT, like killer testicle, laughing Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said K?\n\nSpeaker 2: Kilo tank, yeah, KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: KT, okay, KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Amen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so, Calvin, this is what I did, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did three things.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the third thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges, and I paused\n\nSpeaker 1: your prescription, I credited you back for 63.95 for today's batch, and I put a stop\n\nSpeaker 2: to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then I elevated you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I elevated you to the elite status, so what you do now is go to scoreblue.com when you\n\nSpeaker 1: get a chance and log in with your Mr. Rain 2020 at Gmail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you do that, bud, you're going to see under receipts that I refunded you, and then\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to go to a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: In that category, your prescription, I put a red button with white font that says quick\n\nSpeaker 1: refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So now you have total control, and you can get it at your leisure, even when you go from\n\nSpeaker 2: Virginia to Miami Beach or Vegas, you put in the hotel room number and the address,\n\nSpeaker 1: click that button.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send it to your hotel.\n\nSpeaker 1: All you have to do then is tip the butler and have them send the ladies up so you can\n\nSpeaker 2: do a menage a trois.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just make sure to give me a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: I like that shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I also put another button that says quick girlfriend.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just got to give me her measurements, 38, 34, 38, or how do you want it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want it hazel eyes with brown hair or blonde hair?\n\nSpeaker 2: How do you want it, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want it from Louisiana with a cereal or some Brazilian?\n\nSpeaker 2: How do you like it, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll make sure you get that real quick.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like it either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: My wife don't care about anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you said do what now, go to what now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go to your prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you're going to see a red button there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see that red button that says quick refill?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Click that button any time you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need to send it to another address, go back to your profile and put your\n\nSpeaker 1: shipping address, not your billing address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Put your shipping.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just remember, when you're done doing your menage a trois,\n\nSpeaker 2: you got to switch it back so it doesn't send it back to the hotel.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you're okay for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got to go to what now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Go to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Before that, I got to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you go to scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you're going to log in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to log in on my Gmail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when you log in, let me know and I'll guide you from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you log in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you log in already?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm listening.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll write everything down.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you log in, you're going to go to a category that says receipts.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, receipts.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you go to that category, you'll see the refund there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then from there, you're going to go to your category called your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I got that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then draw a line.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when you click on your prescription, there's going to be a red button that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you're game on, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Game on, dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: Game on, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Game on, dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got four bottles in the drawer already.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife already said, you ain't using it in the last couple of months because I've been sick.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been going back and forth to the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm getting a lot better now so I can be able to do something in the next couple of days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I got some already here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just cowboy up and pop that thing and hit into overdrive\n\nSpeaker 2: and let your lady know that you're still king of the jungle, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then just keep in mind that by law in Virginia,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're not legally authorized to send you more than one refill in a 30-day period\n\nSpeaker 1: and then less than two refills in a one-year period.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just keep me in mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0037 and we'll definitely take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need something stronger, let me know, bro.\n\nSpeaker 1: What y'all got stronger?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got something stronger, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me know when you're ready, dude.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me in a few weeks and I'll get you something stronger, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll let you try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know I wrote this shit down.\n\nSpeaker 2: K.T. Goodrich?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know I wrote it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put it all in the pack. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to lose any of my shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wrote it down.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to write it down again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wrote it down.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put everything back in there where it came in.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put everything back in there where it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on. I got it. I got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I ain't crazy. No, no. I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got it. It's called K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Extension 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, call the same damn number and then you get me all the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you don't have to wait in line and use VIP, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: You cut through everything, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to be calling you soon because you got something stronger.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to see what you got stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got something that will make you Donkey Kong, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be like a silverback.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll be hearing me soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dude, you'll be flying,\n\nSpeaker 2: but your wife is going to get on her knees and ask you to marry her again.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know that shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I buck her ass like this, she's going to let me go no goddamn where.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know this for a fact.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's true.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I give you something stronger, you won't leave the house, bro.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll have ball and chains, bro.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be locked up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got it, man. I'll call you soon, then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, call me soon, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take care of you, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. That's what we do, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're Americans.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've got to look out for each other, how we roll.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stay healthy and be well, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stay healthy and be well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
