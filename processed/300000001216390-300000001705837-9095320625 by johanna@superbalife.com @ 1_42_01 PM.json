How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I just made an order and I was waiting on a response from a doctor, I guess they say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is this an ongoing subscription or is it just a one-time order that I'm ordering through Score Blue?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, great question, sir. So we're not a subscription. We're actually a telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the doctor will write a prescription with refills and then you can set up your account however you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: As our customer, we understand that people's needs are different, so at any time you can modify the frequency\n\nSpeaker 1: and quantity of your order or put a pause on your account at any time. So you're not locked in to get...\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be reoccurring or only when I...\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you can set it up however you want. For the time being, since you just placed an order\n\nSpeaker 2: and you haven't had an opportunity to try it yet, did you want me to put like a four-month hold on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, after you try it out, you can determine how you want to set up your account?\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how frequent I would...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so your prescription will just be on hold. I don't want to cancel it because then once you try the AGB\n\nSpeaker 2: and you love it, you're going to want to place a future order.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I cancel that prescription with refills, we're not going to be able to place that order again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for now, I'll just put it on hold for you until May 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then just call us before then if you want to place a refill or if you want to extend that hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, sir. Thanks for calling in. Have a good one. Take care.",
