    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hold on one second, dear. Let me...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, here's the deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: I talked to somebody a while back, and I told them I wanted to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: And evidently, they did not listen because I got a charge on my bank account yesterday for $95.93, I think is what it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I told them I wanted it to cancel, not to put it on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Obviously, they put it on hold, and they did not listen to what I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need my money back in my bank account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I am stranded right here in a snowstorm in North Carolina with no fucking food and no protein to eat.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can't get nothing with no fucking money.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm at wit's end right now, and I just need to be able to get this shit taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry that I am being the way I am, but I know no other way to be because I need to get my fucking point across.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1667.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, James.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, so the reason why you received another order is because you did call a few months ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you did agree to pause your V.A.P. to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I did not agree to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you spoke to an agent, and you agreed to pause it until January.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I did not agree.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need it cancelled, and I want my money back in my bank account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not even...\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, it won't even go to the address anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do not have the post office box.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will not even...\n\nSpeaker 1: So if we were to cancel it, that means that your prescription would be getting cancelled as well, and you wouldn't be able to reorder no more.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's what I told them last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to cancel the fucking thing, and evidently, they do not understand what fucking cancel means.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cancel means cancel the fucking prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do not need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want it cancelled.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want my fucking money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is all I want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I can go ahead and cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just be aware that you're not going to be able to reorder with us, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: $93.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've been refunded.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you should be seeing that refund within the next three to five business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why has it got to be three to five?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why can't it be like y'all take it out in three to five fucking seconds?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why can it not go back right away?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that's how refunds work.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have a question, you can go ahead and call your bank, but that's how refunds work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have control over that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I understand, and I'm not taking this out on you because I did not talk to you the last time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I talked to someone else.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not taking it out on you, but, I mean, I just want to get my issue resolved.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you are canceling it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did cancel, and you did?\n\nSpeaker 2: I refunded you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, James, so you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you do the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
