    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, good afternoon, folks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I just, um, was wondering, um,\n\nSpeaker 2: not how I signed up for this, but, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe it's $50,000.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, your connection is, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: does not sound good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I cannot understand what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait one second. I can't hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry to hear you. Go ahead, again.\n\nSpeaker 1: I say your connection sounds staticky.\n\nSpeaker 2: I cannot understand what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: My connection is bad?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I can hear you a bit better now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, what were you saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, maybe I'll get a little closer to my folks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, just a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: I signed up, but, um...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you would need to give us a call back\n\nSpeaker 2: because I cannot understand what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me take off speaker for a moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: How about now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds better. Okay, you were saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, within a half hour or so,\n\nSpeaker 1: I signed up to get, um,\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe it's 10 pills of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: the new one out,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, I was reading it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm not new to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have had HIMS before,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I know they were having me take three pills with HIMS,\n\nSpeaker 2: and here I was reading on the bottle\n\nSpeaker 1: because it had 10 pills, and I didn't know\n\nSpeaker 2: 60 bucks for 10 pills, $6 a pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: seems a little pricey to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, but anyways, I pulled the trigger and did it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I was reading on the bottle that was on the picture,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it said,\n\nSpeaker 1: take one hour before engaging in sexual activity\n\nSpeaker 2: and only take one,\n\nSpeaker 1: where I just looked at my prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it says three,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it didn't ask for my weight or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me, is it only one pill, um, per...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so we are not like HIMS, we're actually better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, our Viagra is actually a real Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: that's FDA-approved by Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, so the way on how you take it,\n\nSpeaker 1: it looks like you did purchase 10 pills, 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you will only take one pill, um, 11 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 1: 11 minutes to an hour before being, um, sexually active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I didn't say 11 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I was kind of hoping it would be, um,\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, a little quicker now,\n\nSpeaker 1: the advancement in the, uh, ED medicines.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, that's no big deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not a make-or-break anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it is only one pill then,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I should have 10, um,\n\nSpeaker 2: sexual episodes, I guess, um, with that amount.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, um, I just wanted to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to keep it a reoccurring.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to try it before I committed to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I go in and continue it or stop it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so we do allow you to be able to try it for a whole month\n\nSpeaker 2: and see how you love it,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I'm pretty sure you're going to love\n\nSpeaker 2: because it's the best when it comes to ED medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, but yeah, so we do give you a whole month to try it\n\nSpeaker 2: and a whole month to decide, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: whether you want to make any changes.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is a prescription, so, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: it does come with a monthly interval,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we do give you a whole month for you to be able to try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes with a monthly what, a free trial?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not hearing two.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it comes with a monthly interval, the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: um, so we do give you a whole month for you to try it\n\nSpeaker 1: and then, um, you would just have to give us a call before March\n\nSpeaker 2: to make any changes, um,\n\nSpeaker 1: whether you want to adjust the monthly interval or keep it as is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, how do I stop it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Call you guys or do you just not renew it?\n\nSpeaker 2: You would have to give us a call,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'm pretty sure you're going to love it\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm pretty sure you're going to want to continue with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, um, so, um, it is renewing unless I cancel it\n\nSpeaker 2: and I use this phone number\n\nSpeaker 1: or can I go up on a computer and cancel it and get a verification?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you use this phone number\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can always go ahead and adjust that monthly interval.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you do not want it every month,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can always adjust it to your preference\n\nSpeaker 2: where you can do it every two months, every three months,\n\nSpeaker 1: every four months, and so on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's something that I'd like to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would like to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's on the top right-hand bar.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can go ahead and assist you with that right now\n\nSpeaker 2: and take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and so would you prefer to have it every two months\n\nSpeaker 2: or every three months?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I want to try it first.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so we can adjust it right now for every two months\n\nSpeaker 2: and, like I said, you have the flexibility to give us a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm pretty sure you're going to love it\n\nSpeaker 2: because, like I said, the ATV is the best thing that there is right now\n\nSpeaker 1: when it comes to EV medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that personal opinion or is that verified?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's verified from our customers,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I also know people who take it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they've noticed a huge difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, like I said, I had HIMS, Sidellafil,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it was three pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it didn't work in the beginning,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it still kind of works,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I wanted to try something else with this new advanced.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is the safest way to go\n\nSpeaker 1: because it's actually FDA-approved by ACRA.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, that was something that I was slightly concerned about,\n\nSpeaker 1: but now I'm glad that it's FDA-approved,\n\nSpeaker 2: not that the Food and Drug Administration is all that great,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it is a little more comforting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so just take one pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: One pill when you're going to be sexually active, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: For 12 hours or so?\n\nSpeaker 1: It stays in your system for up to 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so that's cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to walk around with a boner for three days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does stay in your system for up to 14 hours,\n\nSpeaker 1: meaning that during that time you're able to get an erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, thank you very much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so you've adjusted that to every two months now, every other month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I adjusted it to every two months for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you should be expecting another order in March, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: But this is already February, almost February already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you want me to push it until April?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, but I'm going to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it works for me, then I'll call you back and I'll have you bump it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set, and it's been pushed until April, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
