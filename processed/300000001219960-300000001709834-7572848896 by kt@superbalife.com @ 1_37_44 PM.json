    "text": "Speaker 1: I want to use your telephone number to pull up your account and pull up your chart so\n\nSpeaker 2: I can help you put a stop to this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just help me verify some information so we can take care of you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when I pull this up, it says that you're working with Dr. Blackwell, one of our Pfizer\n\nSpeaker 2: doctors.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like he set you up with a VIP status and a prescription for, first it was the 50\n\nSpeaker 2: milligrams of the white diamond pill that we asked the FDA to approve, then it switched\n\nSpeaker 1: to 100 milligrams, and then that's the white diamond seed pill that we make at Pfizer-Lazen\n\nSpeaker 2: France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I see that Dr. Blackwell has ordered the pharmacy to send refills on your behalf.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to put a stop to that so you don't get them on a monthly anymore?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not working, so I went through cancer treatments, and that was one of the problems\n\nSpeaker 2: with my chemo.\n\nSpeaker 1: It affected a lot of my nerves and my nervous system.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I figured this was that Viagra AGV, but I guess this is just standard generic\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let's wait.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm so sorry, it must have been, now that you're telling me this, I see it says 100\n\nSpeaker 2: milligrams Viagra, it doesn't say AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'll do is I'll put a stop to this, whatever you're getting, one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Number two is I'll fire this doctor, I'll change your doctor, and I'll replace everything\n\nSpeaker 1: you have because here's the thing is, if you didn't get what you want, this really grinds\n\nSpeaker 2: my gears, but it's a waste of your money and time, and we're Americans, we've definitely\n\nSpeaker 1: got to do your right.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in light of that, too, what I would highly recommend, and just answer three questions,\n\nSpeaker 1: right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because nine out of 10 times when I come across a case like this, just answer three questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, have you ever, based on your chart, have you ever experienced, I'm trying to look\n\nSpeaker 2: at the writing here, it says, experienced any hardness or erection within a 30 to 60\n\nSpeaker 1: minute period while taking this?\n\nSpeaker 2: No?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes or no?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, only if it's stimulated with the wife.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, so that's just taking this, not with the wife.\n\nSpeaker 1: So have you ever experienced any hardness or erection longer than four to six hours\n\nSpeaker 2: while taking the 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, heck no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then have you...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because this is a starting point.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's two things that we would recommend, and it doesn't cost you anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you ever experienced any adverse side effects other than erection or hardness within\n\nSpeaker 2: a 24 hour period?\n\nSpeaker 1: The only thing I got was usually it's within about an hour after I take Viagra that I know\n\nSpeaker 2: it's going to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: My body gets...\n\nSpeaker 2: I get warm in the face, so I know it's ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: I get flushed, and I know it's ready, but I have not gotten flushed on any of this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, with this, you're absolutely right though, Ted, and that's good to hear, because I can\n\nSpeaker 1: add that to your chart.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in light of what you're saying and what I asked you, and then I looked in your chart,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're absolutely right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got the basic Viagra, so I'll replace all of them for free, and I'll bill the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: So don't worry about it, because you're already paid for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you didn't get what you want, this really grinds my gears.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll change your doctor too.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll fire this guy, and we'll get you another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll pay for another doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in light of replacing them too, what I'm going to send you is going to help three things\n\nSpeaker 1: for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: One, it's called an herbal organic activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have prostate issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not a survivor of cancer, but I do have PTSD.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm a veteran, and I use this every 60 days, because sometimes I just think on R&R, I blew\n\nSpeaker 2: my wad.\n\nSpeaker 1: But here's the thing is, one, it helps on a molecular level release the nerve endings\n\nSpeaker 2: in the ephedra cells in the penis, because there's two chambers in the corpora carnivosa,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is one is for your semen, and one is for your urine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we need blood to go through, because it's essentially a muscle.\n\nSpeaker 1: So number two, it increases the muscle relaxation of the cilic gasoline, which produces a response\n\nSpeaker 2: of nitric oxide, which basically shaves off the calcium levels to dilate the penile arteries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then the third thing it does, it enhances the blood flow in the vasculation, which theoretically\n\nSpeaker 2: leads not only to blood flow, but the spongy tissue inside your penis, in the jonson,\n\nSpeaker 1: causing an erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: And a lot of athletes use this for muscle recovery, enhanced endurance, and boosted\n\nSpeaker 1: energy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're a client already of ours, but over the doctor, we'll change your doctor, one.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll put a stop to all this, two.\n\nSpeaker 2: Three, I'll just replace everything you had to the AGV, which you wanted, because this\n\nSpeaker 1: really pisses me off that you didn't get what you wanted, especially you being a cancer\n\nSpeaker 2: survivor.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you're a damn miracle, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me try to brief hold, and I'll do all this real quick, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just hold your line for a minute.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's up?\n\nSpeaker 1: This AGV, now, isn't, now this is the regular generic Viagra, which is the same prep my\n\nSpeaker 2: doctor's been sending me, everybody else.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've tried so many different organizations for the Viagra 100 milligram, and apparently\n\nSpeaker 2: none of it's really working.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's why I said, okay, well, there's this AGV, but that's the, but that's what?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's supposed to give you a, so the way it's supposed to work better, that's what I was\n\nSpeaker 1: getting, but I guess not.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you didn't get it, and I apologize about the snafu, but it's just the doctor didn't\n\nSpeaker 1: write the right prescription that you wanted, and that's why I'm-\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, is that going to cost me more?\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about the cost, because you already paid for two bottles, and you got the wrong\n\nSpeaker 1: one, so we'll replace it for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: In addition to that, I'm going to send you the activator, which, here's what you're going\n\nSpeaker 1: to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing you're going to do is you're going to take the activator two in the morning,\n\nSpeaker 1: two pills at night, and finish the damn bottle to its entirety to flush out your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you're trying all this other stuff, we need to flush them out, because there are\n\nSpeaker 1: some toxicities and some anti-climatic to certain Viagras.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll flush you out, then I'm going to send you the AG, well, I'm going to send it all\n\nSpeaker 1: at once, but I'm going to send you 20 pills to replace everything you've got of 100 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 2: of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The beauty and power of this FDA-approved AGV Viagra is, number one, the patent time\n\nSpeaker 2: release, and that's why we make it in France, because it's so meticulous.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only challenge you would have is your bride asking you to marry you again, and again,\n\nSpeaker 2: and again.\n\nSpeaker 1: In light of this, hold your line.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to make this right, but don't worry about money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your money is no good unless we can't help you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's no good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold your line.",
