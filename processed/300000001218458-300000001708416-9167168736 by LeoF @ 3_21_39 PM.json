How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I got a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I had plates in order, and I thought I was supposed to be getting\n\nSpeaker 2: that one that's supposed to work in 11 minutes and that you can take with food and drinks.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you guys sent me the one that you got to take an hour before.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mark Schroeder.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want the Rx number on my bottle, or? Do you have the bottle there in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Take one of those pills out for me and let me know what the markings on both sides say of the medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it says\n\nSpeaker 1: AC 340, and the other side has nothing on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so that is wrong. You're right about that, Mr. Schroeder. So I'll have to send you another order out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll have to send you a replacement of additional 40 pills. Those pills that you got, they're very similar like what the guys get\n\nSpeaker 1: from the VA and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they're not the AGV, so I'll have to send you a replacement order out. Are you still there at\n\nSpeaker 1: 8505 Great Iron Court?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's the billing address. I had you send them to...\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, 309 Hamilcourt. Sorry about that, Roseville.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I read the wrong thing there. Yep, so I'm sorry about that. I'm gonna send you out this replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see it on its way tomorrow, and it'll be there by like the end of the week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. And you'll notice the pills, the markings on them will be different, and the label, you'll see that AGV indication, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's what I was hoping to get. Yeah, no, I'm really sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've had a few of these guys go out the wrong way, but you'll see that replacement order come in a few days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and there's no charge for that, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no worries at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
