    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Vasel's Ike Customer Service.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you doing, Jimmy?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael Hockaday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Michael, let me see if I can pull your information up with the number that you're calling from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear with me one second here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Mr. Hockaday, I have you up right here. Let me just confirm, are you still at 7312 Auburn Lane in Hampton, Virginia?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got the right address.\n\nSpeaker 2: And look, man, I'm going to try this.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do you pronounce it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Vasel's Ike, whatever it's called.\n\nSpeaker 1: Vasel's Ike.\n\nSpeaker 2: Vasel's Ike?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I want to try the $3.00, $3.00, $100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can get that for you. Give me one second. Let me get you started.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I got you there for the three bottles for $99.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like the last time, okay, it looks like the last time you ordered with us, you used—\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't have a card or a file for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you can provide me with the credit card information, I can go and take that order for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. How long would it take to get it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the regular shipping usually takes about five to seven business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That'll work.\n\nSpeaker 2: What did I say?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't remember ordering.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wasn't there last time I ordered something with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you must have called in because I was able to pull your information up.\n\nSpeaker 2: You didn't place an order, but you did call us and give us your information.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how I was able to have your address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, I called in, but nobody—\n\nSpeaker 1: Somebody didn't answer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I got your information up, so that's fine. So are you ready for the credit card?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I am, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Four zero zero zero two two three one eighty-seven thirty-seven—\n\nSpeaker 2: Ninety-eight ninety-nine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: And can I get the three-digit security code on the back of the card?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Eight nine four.\n\nSpeaker 2: Eight nine four.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just need the expiration date on the card as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: September 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: September 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'll go ahead and try to process that order for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know the card—\n\nSpeaker 1: I know it's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just I have to go through the process.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You know what it's not liking is a, do you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you like to provide me with the email address at all? Or do you have it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, man, I get so much, I get so much email, man. I just don't even look at that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and indicate no email address available.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got my number.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got me.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds like a plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Go ahead and process that for you again.\n\nSpeaker 1: If this works, I'm going to be calling you out for a subscription more.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds like a plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you get good replies on this?\n\nSpeaker 2: We do. But let me explain to you the scenario that we get.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You know, it did like the credit card number.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me confirm that number that you gave me. Make sure I put it in correctly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me put it back up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Put it back in the wire.\n\nSpeaker 1: Put the wire back in the dargum bag.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to do, too, when you give me four digits at a time, what I do, I'll repeat them back to you to make sure I have everything correct that you're telling me. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: The first four digits is 4,000.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4,000. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. The next one is 2231.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2231.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. And then the next is 8737.\n\nSpeaker 1: 8737.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then 9888.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9888.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the security code I put down was 894.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get it right.\n\nSpeaker 1: 894. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're right on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And expiration is September 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0928. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me try it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0928.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I use this card for everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know you still have no problem with this card.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had to go back to Navy Federal and see what the hell is going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: It went through just fine that time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was doing a raise in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're fine, Mr. Hockaday.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let me explain something to you, Mr. Hockaday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Since this is the, the, the Vasocyte is an all-natural product, the product works really well,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's not a medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's an all-natural supplement.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what that means is that it takes time, a little time to get into your system for you to actually start to see.\n\nSpeaker 2: I use it on two or three weeks myself.\n\nSpeaker 1: For some people, depending on the, how the shape they're in or whatever the case may be,\n\nSpeaker 2: some can take up to a month, a month and a half.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why we do all the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm going to try three bottles for 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have a 90-day return policy.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't see the desired results within those two or three weeks, keep using the product\n\nSpeaker 1: and you will see it happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why we do all the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many of you have to take a day?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have to take them every day?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. You take them every day.\n\nSpeaker 2: What, one a day?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's on the bottle, how many you take a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you look at the bottle for the Vasocyte, I just want to confirm,\n\nSpeaker 2: to make sure that's the case, it's on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Vasocyte.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a V-A-S-O-Z-Y-T-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: V-Y-T-E, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Vasocyte, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw it on YouTube and I said, let me try this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like knowing it's the best one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. And each bottle is a month's supply, so you would take two days.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take two of them daily.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you take two a day?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, two a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, two a day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Both of them at the same time?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I recommend you take both at the same time and I recommend you take them before you go to sleep at night, because that's when your body's...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, take them at night?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's when your body's...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, don't take them in the morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because it absorbs them better in your body when you're resting.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's when most of them get absorbed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good day then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be looking for the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Like I said, it should take about five to seven business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you have a good day now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
