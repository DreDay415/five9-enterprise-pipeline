    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Bruce, KT Goodrich again. Thanks for holding. As a veteran, I take a lot of pride in all\n\nSpeaker 2: of my work, bud, and this really grinds my gears, but I did exactly what you wanted. First thing\n\nSpeaker 1: I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments. I overrode the system and I put\n\nSpeaker 2: a stop to any and all monthly refills and I also put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: I paused your prescription and I noticed in your chart that what he sent you, I don't\n\nSpeaker 2: know what you wanted. Did you want the basic Viagra? Because that's what it says on your\n\nSpeaker 1: chart. Do you want the AGV? Because if they weren't working and you paid for all this,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's not fair to you, bud. But on your chart, it doesn't say. It doesn't say AGV. Most nine\n\nSpeaker 1: out of ten men that work with us want the AGV, not the basic Viagra. This damn thing\n\nSpeaker 2: says, and I read it to you, it said FDA approved 50 milligrams Viagra, Pfizer Viagra. But we\n\nSpeaker 1: have three Viagras. We have the blue pill, $100 pill. We had the basic Viagra, which\n\nSpeaker 2: you got 30 of them over the last three months. And then we have the AGV, the one that's a\n\nSpeaker 1: time release that no one has exclusive. So since you're already baked into about what\n\nSpeaker 2: three refills that weren't working, I'll just replace those to make you whole. Don't worry\n\nSpeaker 1: about any money. I'll send a bill to Dr. Tu and let him eat that. You know, I'll have\n\nSpeaker 2: him, I'll fill his clinic and then I'll replace everything and just take down my extension\n\nSpeaker 1: and just deal with me. Don't worry about any monthly or any charges at all. I put a stop\n\nSpeaker 2: to that. I'm just going to send you 30 to make you whole, bud, because we're Americans,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, and this as a veteran, you know, like I, huh? What was I being charged for\n\nSpeaker 2: this that I didn't ask for? So you, you were, there's a prescription for 50 milligrams of\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra. It doesn't say the AGV, but I can, I'm making a replace and that's what it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you wanted, what am I being billed? It was 63 bucks. I didn't authorize that. It\n\nSpeaker 1: says here, when I looked at the terms and conditions further down, there's a clause\n\nSpeaker 2: there and Dr. Tu has ordered the pharmacy to send you refills on his behalf. It's a\n\nSpeaker 1: standard practice. But I, the care, the question is, I can't refund this because we're just\n\nSpeaker 2: hearing about this now. And when I'm doing my due diligence, I'd be happy to do replacements\n\nSpeaker 1: because we can of what you want in right for free and we can call it a day. I don't want\n\nSpeaker 2: anything and I don't want to pay for anything. That's exactly. I don't want to do bills.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly right. And I don't even know who they're billing. Are they, are they billing\n\nSpeaker 2: a credit card of mine? I didn't know they had a credit card. Wait, wait a minute. So\n\nSpeaker 1: Bruce Wagner, can you confirm your date of birth, sir? February 20th, 1954. And then\n\nSpeaker 2: your day, your shipping address. 1539 Riverside Drive North Hudson, Wisconsin, 54016. And\n\nSpeaker 1: then one last thing, your email. Cause maybe you've been compromised. Who knows? Bruce,\n\nSpeaker 2: Bruce.c.wangeratgmail.com. I see a Bruce.c.wangeratgmail.com. That's correct. That is correct. I don't know\n\nSpeaker 1: why. Have you ever, ever at all wanted the AGV bag or the one that releases in 11 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 2: 12 minutes, it goes about 13, 14 hours. It's the new white diamond pill that, that no one\n\nSpeaker 1: else can make except Pfizer. And we're exclusive to prescribe them to our doctors. Cause that's\n\nSpeaker 2: what I wanted. I wanted to try one pill to see how it worked. I never asked for refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hmm. I completely understand. And that's why I was expressing to you. I put a stop to that\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't want to be, I don't want to be billed this $60 times three. No, what I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: saying to you is that you have received refills and you're saying that you wanted to try them,\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to try one pill. I didn't want to try 30 pills. Well, with all due respect. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: but with all due respect, sir, with pharma, it's not a supplement with pharmaceuticals.\n\nSpeaker 2: When a doctor writes a prescription, they can't write a prescription for one pill. They write\n\nSpeaker 1: you for a 30 day supply, which is the minimum is 10 pills. And you, you probably know that you\n\nSpeaker 2: probably know that with any medication out there in the world. But they keep sending me refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I've had two refills since the original order. Correct. And that's why I put a stop to\n\nSpeaker 2: that. And I don't want to pay for the refills. Of course you don't because, but there is a clause\n\nSpeaker 1: saying that you agreed to, and I, I'm not trying to butt heads with you. I'm here to support you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the best I could do is exactly what you want. And I put a stop to any and all month\n\nSpeaker 1: refills. And then I pause your prescription and you're saying I'm sensing that these didn't work\n\nSpeaker 2: within a 30 minute period or go longer than six hours, right? I didn't even try it yet. Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So try these out, but I'm not sure what you got. If it was the basic or was the AGE,\n\nSpeaker 2: which one did you want? I don't want anything. You just said you wanted to try one. So it's,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's conflicting information. I changed my mind. I don't want to try anything. Sure. I mainly don't\n\nSpeaker 2: want to bill anything. I don't have $60 times three. I'm broke. I completely understand. We're\n\nSpeaker 1: living 20 cents to the dollar. Look, sir. And I, I get that. I completely understand. I'm glad\n\nSpeaker 2: that you're calling in to address this because you haven't tried it. Try it out. See, see how\n\nSpeaker 1: you love it. Then we can go from there. Here's the main thing is I don't want any new pills to\n\nSpeaker 2: be sent at all, which you said you've stopped. I don't want to be billed $60 anymore. And I don't\n\nSpeaker 1: want to be billed for the last two times that you've billed me $60. So if you have those pills\n\nSpeaker 2: and you haven't opened up the package, yes, do you be how I'll be happy to guide you Bruce through\n\nSpeaker 1: the process. And all I'm saying is I'd be happy and thrilled and to support you through the\n\nSpeaker 2: process. And I'll instruct you on how to get that back and you stay with me and I'll get you back\n\nSpeaker 1: that money. Copy that. Are you in line with that? So I can help you. This is a, how we serve one\n\nSpeaker 2: another, sir. We're Americans, you know, we definitely not going to Venezuela, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: and, and, you know, when doctors write a prescription, you know how it goes. They just\n\nSpeaker 2: tell the damn pharmacy to fill these refills and they go, but, um, I don't know. I don't have\n\nSpeaker 1: access. I don't have access to that, bud. There's not enough money in my checking account to cover\n\nSpeaker 2: this. Hmm. Let me see if I can hold your line and see if I can access that information by my admin\n\nSpeaker 1: team. All right. One moment. Hold your line for 30 seconds. We'll work through this. All right,\n\nSpeaker 2: Bruce. Okay. All right. Thank you. One moment.",
