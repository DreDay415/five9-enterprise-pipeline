Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: This message has been transcribed.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment while I notify.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello? Hi, thank you for calling Viagra Escort Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I have been sent two, I guess, two refills and I didn't ask for them. I was going to call you the first time I got one. And by the time I thought about calling you, I got another, you know, package. So I was going to stop this, I guess, automatic refilling. And of course, I was going to get credit. I wanted to get my money back for the second one, at least, that you sent me last week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if we can get that sponsored or not, but I want to try. Okay. So, yes, sir, I can pull up your account. Can I just get the full name and date of birth and let's see how it's organized by the doctor?\n\nSpeaker 2: First name is A-M-I-R. Last name is K-H-A-J-E-H-N-O-O-R-I. And birthday is July 7th, July 8th, 1957.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I see the initial prescription is from November and that was the 50 milligram Viagra, AGV, quantity of 10, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And it looks like the doctor, because it's a 50 milligrams, which is a lower dosage, they wrote it with refills and that's why you saw those recurring like that on monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, this is not a subscription. You're not required to get this every month. It is perfectly adjustable.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you wanted, I could put an extended pause on this and that would allow you to call in and place orders later down the road as needed if you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. If I needed it, I would call. I don't want to get any more to charge for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So let me go ahead and put this on a pause and then when you're ready for a refill, you just give us a call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And as a, I guess, just a feedback, it's really not doing anything for me that I can tell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm not, I'm not in need of it very bad, but I just thought it would be something I can... and vary in something more than normal is really not effective for me to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Have you taken two pills in a sitting yet?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I haven't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought about one and a half, but I didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: So like I said, 50 is a lower milligram dosage. It is perfectly safe for you to take 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'll...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. What I'll, what, yeah, what, that's the average dose normally.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what I'll do for you is I'll go ahead, so on any future orders, because the 50s aren't, you know, I can honor your pricing for any future orders, and I'm just going to go ahead and change your prescription to 100 milligrams, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then so the next time you call and place an order, it should be 100, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Is this, you also have 50, 75, 100, or is it just 50, 100?\n\nSpeaker 1: There's 25, there's 50, and 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, just change it to 100, and if I need to, I will call back and get that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you're all set, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
