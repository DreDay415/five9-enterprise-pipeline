    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello, my name is Daniel, I was answering an advertisement on Facebook for Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: the new Viagra, and I paid for it, I received the package just now, and when I opened the\n\nSpeaker 1: package up, it looks like it's just generic Viagra, not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's just see what happened there, sir, and I can get a list of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name and your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Daniel, my last name is J-I-S-K-O-O-T, date of birth is 12-20-19-59.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and do you have the prescription in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you be able to read to me what it says on one of the tablets?\n\nSpeaker 2: Read to you what?\n\nSpeaker 1: On the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 2: What it says on the tablet, that way I can confirm what the pharmacy sent you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hang on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you there?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm hearing the speakerphone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you want me to open this bottle up?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, please, what does it say on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, on the pill itself, it says AC340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you for confirming that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like the pharmacy did in fact send you the generic Viagra and not the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I will be sending you a replacement order of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, how you're going to know the difference is that, see how I had you read what was on\n\nSpeaker 1: the tablet itself?\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV is going to say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's still going to be a white diamond-shaped pill, but the imprint on the pill will be\n\nSpeaker 2: different, as well as the effect that you're going to experience when you take it, because\n\nSpeaker 1: they've altered it in active ingredients.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Sildenafil is the active ingredient in all of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the inactive ingredient in the new AGV that has been altered, primarily affecting\n\nSpeaker 2: the delivery mechanism system and how it releases in the body.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do take it on an empty stomach for the best results.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a quantity of 20 to replace the ones you have there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can keep the ones you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's nothing wrong with them, per se.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're still FDA-approved, generic Viagra, but the ones I'll be sending you in the\n\nSpeaker 2: mail are by far the superior ones because of all the modifications they've made to\n\nSpeaker 1: improve it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if I heard you correctly, it's going to say 100 on it, not AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will say AGV on the prescription label, but it will also say Sildenafil because that\n\nSpeaker 1: is the active ingredient in all Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it will say AGV on the label.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to make sure, because on the photos that they showed on Facebook, it said Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV, not 100 AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: They do that for marketing purposes because the pill is white, and they want to make it\n\nSpeaker 2: stand out and show that it is the AGV Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've seen that, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I think it confuses our customers because they expect to see blue writing on the pill\n\nSpeaker 2: that says AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: It won't have that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And will this be updated in your database, too?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I do in fact like this and I want to get a refill, I want to make sure I get\n\nSpeaker 1: the right one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Going forward, you won't have any issues with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to message the pharmacy and make sure that the prescription is changed so that\n\nSpeaker 1: you never receive the generic going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then the other question I need to ask you is about billing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Am I going to be billed for a new order of Viagra AGV or no?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this order I'm sending you, obviously, I'm sending to you at no cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: Zero cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I'm replacing the order that you have there that you should have received.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I wanted to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: So zero cost for that, for the new order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then moving forward, is it the same price or is there a different price or anything\n\nSpeaker 1: like that that I need to be aware of?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it'll be the same price going forward if you just wish to continue.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your prescription comes with refills available.\n\nSpeaker 2: So as our customer, we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can set up your account however works best for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that my next question?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: We do have customers that like to get their refills once a month, but we have customers\n\nSpeaker 2: that only get it twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: One order of 10 every six months and everything in between.\n\nSpeaker 2: And at any time, you can modify or change or delay an order or put a pause on your account\n\nSpeaker 1: for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're really flexible in terms of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just recommend not canceling entirely because what that does, it cancels your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you call in again to place an order, we have to pay a doctor fee again to get a\n\nSpeaker 2: new prescription written.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you do call in to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to mail in to get a refill, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what I'm hearing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can call in or I believe you can do it online, but I recommend calling in.\n\nSpeaker 1: But for now, what I'm going to do, I'm going to put a hold on it until August.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have an opportunity to try the AGD and then you can determine how you want to\n\nSpeaker 1: set up your account going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that answers all my questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Should I still, I mean, I've tried Viagra before and I've tried CLS before and I've\n\nSpeaker 1: not had very much success with either.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to try these because maybe these are better than the ones that I had received\n\nSpeaker 1: before.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I just, I don't know, I'm leery about taking pills because I know that sometimes\n\nSpeaker 1: they have complications, health complications.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there anything I need to be aware of or look for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you came to the right place because I understand that concern.\n\nSpeaker 2: There are so many things now in the market.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is really hard to figure out what you're getting and the legitimacy of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But again, I assure you that we are FDA approved and so we are regulated.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the Viagra that we sell, there's no risk in terms of what you've probably heard\n\nSpeaker 2: about other pills out there that are very dangerous.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've heard of heart palpitations, color changes in your eyesight and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to make sure that this is safe and I'm not doing myself any harm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is safe to take.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, with the new AGV, they've eliminated those side effects that people used to experience.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there shouldn't be any risk to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So once the AGV does arrive, I should probably just toss these?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the ones you have there are also FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can toss them if you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: If anything, they just may not work as well, but they're not harmful at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy Valentine's and have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Happy Valentine's.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.",
