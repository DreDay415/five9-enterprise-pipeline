    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, Clint speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm calling to cancel my subscription or prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Copy that. Let me go ahead and pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what is your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 49033\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, what's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: John Cleveland, like the city in Ohio.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alrighty, and I do see your VIP here. Do you mind if I ask why it is you're canceling?\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't work. It doesn't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well it's just a body chemistry type of medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: It could just be trying another pill that's manufactured differently. It could be the answer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So basically what we can do is stop sending you this one and I can send you some of our newest Viagra from France, our newest AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to cancel it completely. I've tried Cialis, I've tried this one. Both of them give me very serious headaches, cluster headaches.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm offering has actually been formulated over the last 10 years, clinical trials to not have those type of side effects that usually gets associated with Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like the headaches, runny nose, stuffy, blurry vision, flustered feeling.\n\nSpeaker 2: This has actually been made to eliminate those side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I can send it for free. You can see for yourself. It's totally up to you, but that is something I can do for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I mean I'm okay with that, but I want to cancel the subscription to this Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we don't want to keep sending that to you, sir, if it's not working clearly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we're going to stop that. We're going to send this to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do ask, though, is that you take my number and extension and call me back. Let me know that this is working better for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, hold on. Let me get a pencil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so my name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm hard of hearing.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries. My name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quinn, C-O-I-N-T.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, Q-U-I.\n\nSpeaker 1: Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: N-T.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, N-N, 2-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it. And then the extension is 0-0-3-5.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0-0-3-5. At this number, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. You are all set. I'm getting those out to you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
