    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Kevin Chapman.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was calling Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: She gave me her extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: I used that.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent me over to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, your guys called me for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to know what was the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, let me take a look.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like she's assisting another caller,\n\nSpeaker 1: so let me see if I can help you, Mr. Chapman, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: OK.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you don't mind, can you verify your zip code for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 48218.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think they wanted me to verify my phone number, which\n\nSpeaker 2: is 313-982-2048.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that isn't it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, it looks like the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: that wasn't the reason for asking you to call us in.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor had a question for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can read the doctor's question,\n\nSpeaker 2: and just let me know what the answer is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear with me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so this is from Dr. Sanderson.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to read this verbatim.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says, hello, Kevin.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm Dr. Sanderson, a board-certified physician\n\nSpeaker 2: licensed to practice in your state.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will be taking care of you online today,\n\nSpeaker 2: along with our medical team.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your usual blood pressure\n\nSpeaker 2: when taking your blood pressure medication?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your blood pressure?\n\nSpeaker 2: 173 over 80.\n\nSpeaker 1: 173 over 80?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'll send that over to the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: so then they can continue with the visit.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was pretty much it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, basically, you know, sometimes, I'm a smoker,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that raises it up for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's sometimes it's even a little lower than that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the last time I took my blood pressure,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was 173 over 80.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, let me just send that over to the doctor as well, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that going to make a difference?\n\nSpeaker 2: It gives a bit of an explanation,\n\nSpeaker 1: so he understands that maybe there's external factors that\n\nSpeaker 2: might affect your blood pressure.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, so I took down what you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm a smoker.\n\nSpeaker 1: It raises it for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's usually a little lower than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that OK for me to send to him?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the answer, for real.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, there you go.\n\nSpeaker 1: That gives him some context, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, just how long is it going to take for the product to come?\n\nSpeaker 2: If they're going, now I'm wondering if they're even\n\nSpeaker 1: going to send it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's completely up to the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't tell you one way or another.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but usually it's pretty quick.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, once the doctor, let me see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me take a quick look at something.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they sent this message on the 26th.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's now the 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it took us a couple of days to get an answer, which is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they normally spit out an answer within 24 hours\n\nSpeaker 1: or much less.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's always contingent on how quickly people can respond.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, once they have a determination\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's an A-OK, pharmacy ships it out in 24 to 48 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then where are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're in Michigan.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's shipping from Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not even that far from you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Except for the weather, apparently.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hope you guys aren't buried under snow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we're not buried, but we are definitely snowed in.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, there are other states that are far worse.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I think that we probably, in the last week or two,\n\nSpeaker 2: have about eight inches of snow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Eight inches of snow?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's not considered buried?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my god.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, 24 inches is buried.\n\nSpeaker 2: You look like you live in igloo at that point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, Michigan definitely produces that kind of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, eight inches is no big deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's on the grass, you know what I'm saying,\n\nSpeaker 2: with the accumulation building up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But on the sidewalk, you know, you\n\nSpeaker 1: don't clean the sidewalk up.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it just looks like a road with walls on it, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my god.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, my god.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my god.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you know, like you're walking through a maze,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's wild.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're in California.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're in Southern California, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I used to live in California.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have no time when it's in the snow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I tell you what, I tell you\n\nSpeaker 2: what, your basketball team sure, I mean, our football team\n\nSpeaker 1: sure came here and caught up in this cold weather.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the Rams came here and lost by, you know, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just couldn't believe how they adjusted to the cold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know, Stafford was from here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, he basically know how\n\nSpeaker 1: to weather through the storm.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the other guys is the ones I was impressed with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, anyway, so, OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, good so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you have any other questions,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know where to find us, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
