    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jimmy. I need to cancel my prescription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me see if I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to try to pull up the information with the phone number that you're calling from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this Jimmy I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Jimmy. I do have you up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see you're getting the Viagra, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like your prescription is given to you once a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and take care of your request for you first of all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Jimmy. Thank you for holding.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was able to go in there and I stopped those monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also stopped the monthly refills that were included with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I stopped those monthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you won't be getting that anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me ask you, how are the pills working for you, the Viagra that you're getting?\n\nSpeaker 2: How are they working for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: They work good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't need that many a month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just call and order when I need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do this for you, Jimmy, because Viagra actually costs you a lot more doing it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Rather than just canceling out altogether, what I can do,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can just pause you out for like six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll give you a chance to get caught up.\n\nSpeaker 1: What that'll do, that'll keep you grandfathered in at the price you're paying,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you won't have to pay those tariff prices when they kick in because you're already grandfathered in.\n\nSpeaker 1: And also, if six months isn't long enough for you, you can always call like you did today\n\nSpeaker 2: and say I'm not ready, push me back a few more months so we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you need them before then, you can always call and order before then\n\nSpeaker 2: and get them with no problem because you're already grandfathered in with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that something I can do for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm going to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me give you the date so you know as far as that's concerned.\n\nSpeaker 2: The date that I'm going to have looks like the next one would be July the 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, like I said, again, if you need them before then, just give us a call and you can get them.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need us to push you back, just give us a call and say push you back a few more months,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we'd be more than happy to do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I appreciate it, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Consider it done.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
