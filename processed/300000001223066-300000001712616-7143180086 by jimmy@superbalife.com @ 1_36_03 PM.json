    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Jimmy. Hey, I'm trying to log into your system and stuff like that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it puts me into the setup phase, but as soon as I put my phone number in,\n\nSpeaker 2: it says phone number is already in use. Put it in a different one, but I can't\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's my only number. So what do I do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this Jason I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Jason, I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you're trying to place a new order. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like I have most of your information up already.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to confirm what I have.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have your email at jasoncruze at live.com, L-I-V-E dot com,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I have your phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same number you called, 714-318-0086.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how I was able to pull your information up.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I also have your date of birth, October the 6th, 1971.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything so far so good?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so what I don't have is your actual shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to give me that, I can actually put that in the system too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's 20331 Densmore.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's D-E-N-S-M-O-R-E Lane in Huntington Beach.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I got that at 92646, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct, yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there an apartment number or a suite number on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just that?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the house.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm assuming you were interested in the Viagra AGB?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it looks like that, well, let me just tell you the packages\n\nSpeaker 2: and bundles that come in and how much they cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get 40 pills for $149, 25 pills for $99, or 10 pills for $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this is like the new stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's better than the regular stuff, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: By far, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It works faster, lasts longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it doesn't have those same side effects that a lot of people got\n\nSpeaker 1: with the generic Viagra, a little dizziness or headaches, upset stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's new and improved,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's the best ED medicine that's out on the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there's nothing better as of right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, let's do the one for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you want to do the 40 pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me start on your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it looks like that you tried to do the medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just go through it real quick to see what you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are there any side effects?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, blood pressure, none, none.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it looks like there's a couple of questions that you didn't get,\n\nSpeaker 1: so let me just help you with those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, are you currently taking any medication?\n\nSpeaker 2: The last two words you indicated, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now I just need to get the spelling of the medication,\n\nSpeaker 2: the milligrams, and how often you're taking it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have that available to give to me right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's just the standard Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, I mean your medication, your medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, yeah, no, I don't have that on me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I can go ahead and continue,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I know for a fact the doctor is going to want to know the name of the\n\nSpeaker 1: medication and the milligrams and how often you take it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can continue.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can at least get the order kind of get started for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I do know that they're going to reach out to you for that information\n\nSpeaker 1: because you indicated that you are currently taking medication in the last\n\nSpeaker 2: two weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the one I do know is Benzopril.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there anything other than Benzopril, too, that you're taking?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it some other stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just the Benzopril?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was taking Adderall, but I stopped taking all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, can you spell the name of the one you're taking now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the spelling?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Benzopril, that's B-E-N-Z-P-R-I-L, I believe, Benzopril.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me try it again to see if I didn't write what you said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Spell it one more time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I have it in my notes because I needed it before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope, that's not it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know I have it here somewhere.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they'll probably just have to call me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just trying to pull it up myself for you to see if I see it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said it was –\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like – the name of it's like Benzopril.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go to – actually, let me go to my CVS because that's where I get it from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I think I have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Benzopril is for high blood pressure?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what you're looking for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I think I have the spelling of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I have a B-E-N-A-Z-E-P-R-I-L.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: B-E-N-A-Z-E-P-R-I-L.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do you know the milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know the milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Twenty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Twenty milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Twenty milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how often do you take it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I take one pill once a day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Twenty milligrams daily.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's the only thing that you're taking right now as far as medication?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only thing I'm taking, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I take it to help out.\n\nSpeaker 2: That works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the next question is do you have any allergies to food, drugs?\n\nSpeaker 2: This would include prescriptions, any over-the-counter medications, herbs,\n\nSpeaker 1: diet, vitamins or supplements?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no allergies.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, in the past several months, have you had any of the following?\n\nSpeaker 1: Passing out, dizziness, seizures, or chest pains?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, now it's a little flimsy of the next question,\n\nSpeaker 1: but just bear with me until I get through them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have any of the following medical conditions?\n\nSpeaker 1: Diabetes, hyperlimbema, vascular disease, emotional problems, hormone problems,\n\nSpeaker 2: kidney disease, neurological problems, trauma or injury to the penis, pelvis,\n\nSpeaker 1: hernia, testis, or rectum, prostate problems, urinary problems, sleep apnea,\n\nSpeaker 2: chronic fatigue or weakness, retinospigamotosis,\n\nSpeaker 1: a significant bend in your penis, pain with an erection,\n\nSpeaker 2: problems with ejaculation, orgasms that are not related to hardness,\n\nSpeaker 1: cancer, radiation of the bladder, prostate, or rectum,\n\nSpeaker 2: unexplained weight loss, joint pains, sexually transmitted diseases,\n\nSpeaker 1: heart disease, or any urological surgeons?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing I have is an enlarged prostate.\n\nSpeaker 1: Enlarged prostate?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is not on here, so that's not needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can share that with me at the end if you want to,\n\nSpeaker 2: because it's going to add to anything you want to share with the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the last three months,\n\nSpeaker 2: have you used any of the following drugs recreationally?\n\nSpeaker 1: Crystal meth, marijuana, poppers, heroin, ecstasy, or cocaine?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I have not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, now is the point,\n\nSpeaker 1: is there any additional information you want to share with the doctor\n\nSpeaker 2: to introduce yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can feel free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just an enlarged prostate.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't think that's going to affect it,\n\nSpeaker 1: because normally it would be on the questionnaire, but that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: There was an error in question 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I didn't check.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have any medical issues.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and submit this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you want to go with the Viagra OGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm sorry, I don't recall which amount you went to go with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you say the 40 pills for 149?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get that listed for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't mention the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: They come in 25, 50, and 100, which is the most popular,\n\nSpeaker 2: the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to go with the 100?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have your shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put in a 20331 Dinsmore Lane.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's Huntington Beach, 92646.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, of course, that's in California.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just need a credit or debit card for the purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: 5403-8560-3963.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4982.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the expiration date.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait, wait, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: The card didn't go through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe I didn't hear you right.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is what I have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct me if I don't have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll go again and I'll just follow up with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 5403-8560-3963.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I don't have that three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 4982.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I had a four instead of three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the expiration month and year?\n\nSpeaker 2: 0930.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the three-digit security or CBB code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 470.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll go ahead and process this.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it doesn't go through, it's because Citibank sucks.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, actually, it went through no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: It went through fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this is your first time order.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have an opportunity to upgrade your order to 40 additional pills for\n\nSpeaker 1: additional 89.40.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a one-time, first-time order to do that if you wish to do that at this\n\nSpeaker 1: time.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just got to offer it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just comes up.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Jason, your order has been placed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, again, the doctor is going to go over your survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: If everything is okay, which it looks pretty much good to me, you should\n\nSpeaker 2: receive them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not the doctor, though, but you should receive them within seven to ten\n\nSpeaker 2: working days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And hopefully they come out faster than that, but that's the time frame.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
