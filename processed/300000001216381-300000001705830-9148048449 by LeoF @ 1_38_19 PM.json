    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I got an order that I did not place, and I got it in the mail today.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: David Ryan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry to cut you off there, Mr. Ryan. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, there's nothing to cut off. I just didn't place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I see here. Yeah, it looks like they set you up on our VIP prescription last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, you didn't place this order. It was a while back, your last one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't place this order, yeah. I put everything on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me see. I think it got put on hold for five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why it went out. So the fifth month was this past week or what have you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't confirm this order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I spoke to somebody after the previous order, and they talked me through, and I put it on hold,\n\nSpeaker 2: like indefinite hold until I decide to not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think they were under the impression you wanted it on hold for five.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I would have clearly stated that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, what do you want me to do for you now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to cancel this for you or put it on another hold, or what can I do for you, Mr. Ryan?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want to cancel it. I don't want this. I'll mail this back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll mail this back. I have no use for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can send you instructions on how to get that back to us. No problemo.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send that to your email. And you don't want any orders in the future?\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't want me to keep the account active for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. I can cancel. Once I do, I won't be able to fill the prescription for you in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to make you aware and let you know we are the only FDA-approved vendor of the medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set, Mr. Ryan. I went ahead and canceled that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I sent you the email with the return address. You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so will I be getting a refund? This is my next question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, in the back, we'll give you a full refund on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you emailed me the return stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, that's correct. Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, can I just – I mean, all I did was rip the plastic open to see what this is because there's nothing on the return address.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I didn't open anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, no. So I have the address there for you and the email and all that good stuff. You'll see all that. No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just saying, so I can take the envelope I have now and just put it in a new envelope with a label that I can create from your return.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly. There you go.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll get the refund back after you get this back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
