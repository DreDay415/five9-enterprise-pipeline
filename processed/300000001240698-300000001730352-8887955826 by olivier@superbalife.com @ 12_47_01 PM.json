    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, hello, how are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm fine. I need to cancel the subscription or prescription you've been sending me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I have the phone number used for that prescription, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Two five three eight eight seven nine three two nine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I...\n\nSpeaker 1: Still offer?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I see you have a prescription for Viagra 50 milligram, 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think every 30 days from what I can see. Any health concern or you just don't want the 30 days?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 2: I...\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't want anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Want all of this?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I've tried to cancel this a dozen times and I've got the runaround.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my bank now is asking me to fill out a fraud form.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now that I've got your phone number and stuff, we're doing well?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can put today's date down that I did contact you just to cancel all orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I mean if you don't need it, you could pause it, but if you don't need it, I'm gonna cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just be aware if anything changes, the price will be different because obviously they're gonna have to reinvest in a doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 1: Reimburse you, but yeah, everything is great. Everything's canceled for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the bank will be asking you for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Payments since I've tried for damn near a year to get this thing canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you guys have given me the runaround. Yeah, if you like, you can return the pills for a refund. That's not the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the banks don't want a refunding.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I mean, we're gonna send them, let them know the same thing. If we don't have the product, we can't be found.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, like any other company, right? So...\n\nSpeaker 2: I have all of them. I have, yeah, I...\n\nSpeaker 1: Have all of the pills right here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you usually have a 90-day policy so we can refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, for that matter, just return, refuse on return on a package for those are the 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Supply. When did you start to do the cancel request?\n\nSpeaker 1: Last year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I don't see no...\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course you don't, of course you don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, just return.\n\nSpeaker 1: Know that for sure the last one that you just got, for sure January, and then, you know, if there are more requests...\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, they're gonna look into it because there is a limitation as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, you can get a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you want me to now save the package and send it back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, send it in a fucking plastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has no return labels.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you just... that was all for a package?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: So usually the way it works, you know, when you write on a label because we didn't charge you for shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: We financed that shipping, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you write \"refuse return\" on it, and when the bad men see that, he understands our Mr.\n\nSpeaker 2: Also got the wrong package. I got to send that back to where it came from.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't need to go to the post office. You don't need to repackage it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything is all taken care of. You just put \"refuse return\" on the package. I usually went to what people do.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't say where it came from.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't say what's in the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you have to open the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you have to find out that's not for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just take it nicely and you just write \"refuse return\" because obviously you got to open to see that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want that. I don't need it and you take me nicely, right? \"Refuse return,\" the man may understand our Mr.\n\nSpeaker 1: Also check that's not for him. I got to go back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure I'm getting a runaround again.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is no runaround. It's just returning the product for refund like any company, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's to return it to where?\n\nSpeaker 1: Southgate, Kentucky. It's on the bottle, it's on a label of the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'll continue with my report for fraud with the bank, thank you, okay.",
