    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. I just got a text saying that you needed my phone number updated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your account to see what they're saying, if I have to say anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you get a text or something? Is that what happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, saying you need my phone number updated, but it was texted to my phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: That doesn't sound right, because I have your phone number as 321-522-2646.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just confirm, what's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Troy Berkmeyer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Troy Berkmeyer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I see that under your name. I see that you do have your prescription at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to try to see if there's any notes out there, as far as that's concerned.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no, there's a link. They want you to upload.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, see, the doctor's saying, to complete your medical visit,\n\nSpeaker 1: we require you to upload a photo of your driver's license for patient's verification.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your doctor will not be able to evaluate the treatment until this is completed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You may send us the photo from the clicks on the text.\n\nSpeaker 2: There should be a link that you can click on and upload your driver's license.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what they want you to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, but the problem with that is, if somebody else takes care of it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on somebody else's plan, and it wouldn't let me do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you on someone else's?\n\nSpeaker 1: Me and somebody else share a phone plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when I try to do that, it wouldn't let me do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, your phone is not allowing you to update the driver's license.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send it to you through text.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have pictures of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the problem is, when I want to go do it, they're like, oh,\n\nSpeaker 2: your name doesn't match the subscriber on this phone line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, sometimes that happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the phone company is not letting you send the information to the text.\n\nSpeaker 1: I try to message the doctor to let him know that, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I ran into this with a little phone game that you can buy also,\n\nSpeaker 1: where I can't purchase things on the phone game because it's in his name\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's not going to pay him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even if I have enough money to pay for it, it won't take mine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'll try to get it linked again.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll call back if it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: But all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm making a note now to the doctor to see what suggestions they have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I can go back and try to get it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because I don't know why I wouldn't let you send an attachment to the\n\nSpeaker 1: phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a good point.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if that's a good idea.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says you may send us a photo by clicking the link.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what you can do, I believe you can take a picture of your photo,\n\nSpeaker 2: your ID, click on that link,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can attach the attachment of the picture with that link.\n\nSpeaker 2: By hitting that little paper clip.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've already got pictures of my ID.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've already got pictures of my ID.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so when you –\n\nSpeaker 1: When I have to move into my house and shit, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you click on the link,\n\nSpeaker 2: you don't see that little paper clip where you can attach one of those\n\nSpeaker 1: pictures?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will try it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it should be a little paper clip.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like a paper clip where you can get the attachment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know what attachments look like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just trying to describe it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's what they need.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what the doctor's waiting for.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, he's not letting me.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.",
