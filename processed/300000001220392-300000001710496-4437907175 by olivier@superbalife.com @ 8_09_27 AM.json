Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Logan Starr?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so I see your prescription from Dr. Blackwell for Viagra 100 mg, 20 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need refills? You could put a pause and just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just do that then. Yeah, pause it because I got so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got so much now, I could sell it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see. Yeah, no, that's fine. I wish you would have called us even earlier so we would have stopped.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're just assuming the patient is active, you know what I mean? Because most patients are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I try. I am. I'm just not like I used to and I tried canceling it online a while ago and it just kept on coming.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm going to pause you so that way you don't lose your privilege, perks and price and any promotion because you get to apply automatically to your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you're just not going to receive the monthly. That was the original prescription every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was right up to half a year and then you can get it once or twice a year and or more if you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just got to. Okay, so I could just go online, just go online and just order it like like go back into the profile and.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Okay, that'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: The quick refill button or you call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then when you place your order, if you want to adjust your frequency, you got to call us usually most of the time for do it the right way.\n\nSpeaker 1: So make sure to call us, let's say, if you want to adjust your frequency, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. So as of right now, I'll receive no more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. All right. That's all. That's what I needed to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Yeah. Give us a call to reorder and yeah, good to hear from you and you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Thank you. You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye. Bye. Bye.",
