How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I was changing my prescription that I currently have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get your name or do you need an account number? Yeah, first and last name would be perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Dean Hawley.\n\nSpeaker 1: H-O-L-L-Y?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Hawley, what's going on? How can I help?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I—\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been ordering Viagra, but it kind of doesn't agree with me. So I want to change to Cialis and—\n\nSpeaker 1: I—\n\nSpeaker 2: Did the change and then it kind of got a little confusing.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway, I went to my receipt online here and it shows that in fact, I did order Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Quantity 18 and I got an order ID. So does that mean it changed or am I still going to get the Viagra too?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so you'll get Cialis only. The pharmacy will never send you two prescriptions at one time. So no worries there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it says fulfillment status at pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what that means is that they've got the order and they're working on it and they'll ship that instead of the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, they'll process that, fulfill it, and then send it on out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I don't need to do anything more?\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope. You're all set now. You're just waiting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now a question though is if I decide to stop—\n\nSpeaker 2: Fulfillments that like it doesn't agree with me. This doesn't either.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do I stop my—can I stop it online or do I need to call you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give us a call right back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, very good. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.",
