    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd like to order some Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. What was your first and last name, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: First name is Jeff, J-E-F-F. Last name Hasner, H-A-S-N-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Mr. Hasner, it looks like you were doing the, what, 50 pills at a time, 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: You going to do that same order again today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what about the newer stuff? Tell me what the difference is.\n\nSpeaker 2: The new Viagra A-G-V, it activates in as little as 11 minutes, so it's faster acting,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it lasts up to 14 hours in your system, so it lasts longer and it acts faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it sold in the same kind of dosages?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we have a 100 milligram option if you want to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: What are the other options for it?\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 milligrams and 25 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see. And what's the cost difference?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can actually get you a little price break.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you wanted to try the new Viagra A-G-V just because it's your first time trying it,\n\nSpeaker 1: I can set you up with 40 pills for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I usually get 50, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on just a second. 40 for $163. And how much would 50 be?\n\nSpeaker 2: 50 is $249.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's quite a...\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's do the 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let's try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now what card do you have?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a MasterCard here that ends in 7608.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. Let's use this card here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a Visa.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll take the new card number whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: 4465, 4203, 9260, 1076.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: April of 2028.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the CBV code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 312.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. I'm going to place this order for you now. Give me just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on. This is a different address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's the address on your card?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's my winter address, 777 East Quartz Avenue, number 8007.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sandy Valley, two words, Nevada, 89019.\n\nSpeaker 1: It might come up as Gene, J-E-A-N, Nevada at that zip code, and that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's actually 20 miles away.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries. So you said 777 East Quartz Avenue, number 8007, Sandy Valley, Nevada, 89019.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Give me just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you heard any people, have you talked to anybody who's used them, likes them better, doesn't like them better?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, we're getting a ton of great feedback. People seem to like the pill quite a bit more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some people don't, but that's fewer and far in between. Some people like the regular generic Fiagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the AGB definitely seems to be much more popular.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, give it a chance when you try it and let us know how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now, what's the time limit on ordering this thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, there's a certain amount you can have over a certain amount of time, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I forget how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: For the 40 pills, I think it's like 60 days, so you can place another order in like, I don't even know if it's 60 days,\n\nSpeaker 1: but essentially you would be able to place another order March 26th.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you can always call back to check before then as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Bye-bye.",
