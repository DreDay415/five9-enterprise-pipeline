    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, I want to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't realize I was getting a one-time bill.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I got another bottle in the mail today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Steven Brock?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: From what I can see, Dr. Green wrote you a prescription for 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: The reason you got, from what I can see, you got your refill\n\nSpeaker 2: because you ordered 10 tablets originally,\n\nSpeaker 1: even though you had the pill upgrade, but the original order was 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually in those cases, knowing that there is 30 days in a month,\n\nSpeaker 1: the doctor is assuming that you will run out and provide your refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you don't need it, we advise the pharmacy to put a pause\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you're just going to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you don't have to get it on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just the original script from the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when you're not active, we put a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can say, hey, you know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Brock here paused me for 3 months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need it in 3 months, 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, actually paused me for half a year and I'm going to call as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not required.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is not Netflix.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is a prescription with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you don't need them,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're not going to send you every month 10 pills that you don't need, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, I can advise the pharmacy to pause you for now\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can call to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can get your refill once or twice a year to lock your price in.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way when you reorder, you don't have to pay a new price.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're still a patient.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just don't get billed or receive any refill every month,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you lock your price and keep your privilege active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Prescription available to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how long do you want to be paused for?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got a lot of Viagra, a lot of pills right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, probably six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Six months, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can order sooner than that in case you need something.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, call us to reorder or log into your account,\n\nSpeaker 2: press the quick refill button, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: But the good thing is we lock you at your price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Prescription is available.\n\nSpeaker 1: Company don't have to pay a physician to do a new evaluation, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So can I pause it for, like, a year because I've got, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: two or three bottles of this stuff around.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the system allows to go six months at a time, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I see that you have one bottle here with us where you've got 20\n\nSpeaker 2: pills and you've got a second one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I have a lot from my doctor from here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was hoping I'd get something that was maybe not such bad side effects\n\nSpeaker 1: like headaches and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're experiencing that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you take Cialis in the past or is your first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you take Cialis before?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which one gives you more side effects, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Which one works better?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think the S, the one you said, not the Cialis, that one's worse.\n\nSpeaker 1: You think which one is better, Viagra or Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: Which one you feel better with and you like better?\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're going to keep you on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just going to pause you so you don't get it as often anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get it once or twice a year to have a couple, ten pill here and there,\n\nSpeaker 2: but no more on a 30-day basis anymore, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, but they're not going to, in six months, are they going to send me it\n\nSpeaker 1: automatically or?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they'll send you an email to check on your status,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you can call as well to update.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you still have pill left, you can call MBA.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just update.\n\nSpeaker 1: Basically, you keep your profile active.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't receive anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's pretty easy, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then call us to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
