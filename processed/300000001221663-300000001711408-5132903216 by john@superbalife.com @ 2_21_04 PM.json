I don't know, last week maybe or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's Gary Ryan, R-H-E-I-N, and the zip code is 45039.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Gary. One second, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I see. Hackney Circle, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, you put this order in on Sunday, and you didn't know this because I don't think it shows you on your site,\n\nSpeaker 1: but your prescription needed to be renewed, so we had to get that renewed.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just got approved today, so they'll ship it out probably tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Well, I mean, there's no hurry. I just hadn't received any information.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was, you know, not sure what was going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what happened, so that's why you haven't heard anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you should get an email probably tomorrow with tracking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, sir. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
