    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Michelle. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Michelle. This is Don Wiggum calling. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How you doing, Don?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, I was trying to get off the phone because I saw you sitting in my list.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I figured you were on the phone, so I just held.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, I want to pay you some money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's what happened. I didn't ever get the pills and—\n\nSpeaker 2: That you had told me you were sending, and then I finally got them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway, I had one more day before I could deny the charge on my card.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just in case, I went ahead and denied the charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I saw that the credit card company told me that you guys refunded me all of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pills do work a little better than the first ones you sent me, the regular Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to pay you for that. I want to pay you for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do I need to do? Just tell my credit card company that I want to pay for those?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I see. So whenever someone calls their credit card company and disputes it—\n\nSpeaker 1: It's called a chargeback where we automatically...\n\nSpeaker 2: And then our company blacklists you from ever buying from us again because it hurts our business.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'm going to have...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. It's just automatic.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to have the IT guy go ahead and remove yours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because it's just bad for our business when people call the bank before calling us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I hadn't...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I had one day left.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had one day left to dispute the charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it had been 60 days and y'all sent me the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I returned the others.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they sent me the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never knew if I was going to get credit or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I never knew if I was going to get credit or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I figured...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I wrote them and told them.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, they've been very cooperative.\n\nSpeaker 2: The customer support has been very cooperative.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, I've got one more day to dispute the charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just in case...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't blame you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would do anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not doing it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, I owe you for the pills that you sent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just messaged the IT guy to remove your thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So can I give you a call back in like 10 minutes?\n\nSpeaker 1: And instead of just giving me money, I'll just send you another 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Another 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not just going to take your money without...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you pay, then I'll just send you just a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I hadn't paid.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hadn't paid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now, they've zeroed everything because y'all issued a credit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I can do the charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, what I was asking, since y'all sent me the wrong thing and I hadn't spent so much time—\n\nSpeaker 2: How about I just pay the $64 and something?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95?\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that good?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're too sweet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that way, we'll remove your blacklist in case you ever need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've already recommended them to a buddy of mine and...\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I told him they work a little bit better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, it's not miraculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you had also told me something about if it didn't work as effectively as I thought...\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, the activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'd recommend something else.\n\nSpeaker 1: What?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, we have...\n\nSpeaker 1: Amino acid.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the amino acid supplement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what you do, you take two before you go to bed every night for about seven days in a row.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what it does, it kind of reboots your systems and increases your blood flow and your oxygen levels.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you don't take the activator with the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take the activator for like seven days in a row and then take the AGB after the seventh day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what is that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nitrates or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's amino acid nitric oxide production.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nitric oxide.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's got L-carnitine, L-citrulline, L-arginine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's pretty much it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to send you that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send it to you for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the only thing is you would have to go back on the automatic refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what we can do is we can pause you for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your profile open and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause that until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll call my credit card company and explain it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And tell them to charge me the $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll give you a call back, too, because I've got to go talk to the IT guy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no big deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can call me tomorrow if you're busy.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's no big deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's kind of slow today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get it done today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you're a nice lady and I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm glad I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you say Don or do you go by William?\n\nSpeaker 2: Don?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Don, but all my partners list it as William.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect, Don.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you a call back in like 15 minutes or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
