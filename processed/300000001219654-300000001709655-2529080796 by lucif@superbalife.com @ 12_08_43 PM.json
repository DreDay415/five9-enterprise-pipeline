    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, I need an agent in the score blue department, I mean can you help me with that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I, back in the first part of December, I contacted score blue to put an extension\n\nSpeaker 2: up on my subscription, and one was put up there up until June, but then on January 1st,\n\nSpeaker 1: I received an order, as well as $113 was taken out of my account, I received a package on,\n\nSpeaker 2: what was that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I see the last charge from us was on 12-30, so this is before you called us on January\n\nSpeaker 2: 6th?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, I called, January 6th is when I received, is when I made a call to have my money put\n\nSpeaker 2: back on my account, but I made this call back in December to put an extension up on my subscription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it was supposed to have been put up there until June, but I received an order the first\n\nSpeaker 2: day of June, that extension was on the 6th, that extension was done days after that order\n\nSpeaker 1: was already processed, so that order was processed on 12-30, when you called and got the postponement,\n\nSpeaker 2: that was on the 6th of this month, so that was after that order had already been processed\n\nSpeaker 1: and went out, because I could see all the notes here and everything happened, so all\n\nSpeaker 2: that happened when you called in and you got that postponement, it was not in December,\n\nSpeaker 1: it was on the 6th of January.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, I mean, let me tell you, I mean, evidently whoever I spoke to in December didn't put\n\nSpeaker 1: the extension in.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have any calls for you from December, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You never called us in December.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have the notes right here of when you called and what time you called and everything, sir,\n\nSpeaker 1: we don't have any phone calls from December.\n\nSpeaker 2: What about November?\n\nSpeaker 1: No calls, no phone calls for November.\n\nSpeaker 2: Only call that I have here in the notes I have is that when you called on the 6th of\n\nSpeaker 1: this month and got it postponed for until June, like you said, but that was this month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, I'm sorry, this wasn't recorded, right, because I know I made this call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I don't, I don't see, I don't see any calls, I mean, everything else is recorded\n\nSpeaker 2: fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why that one call would be neglected to be recorded, but I mean, there's no other\n\nSpeaker 2: calls.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you call us?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's scored blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't know what agent that I might have spoke to, but the extension was supposed to\n\nSpeaker 1: have went in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when it didn't, and I, do what now?\n\nSpeaker 2: The extension did go in, sir, when you called us on the 6th of January.\n\nSpeaker 1: I called on the 6th because of the fact that I received that order, and I was told then\n\nSpeaker 2: to send it back, and at that point then, the same thing I'm talking to you about now is\n\nSpeaker 1: when I talked as well on the 6th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, well, I mean, well, that makes sense because there is no notation of you\n\nSpeaker 1: ever calling us and getting any postponements before the 6th.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no phone calls or any kind of postponements before the 6th.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't see any of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, we can always adjust this for you so you can, you know, for the future, but I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: this, there was, there is no proof of any calls or any kind of transcripts or anything\n\nSpeaker 2: like that from any calls before that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can understand that, but now, even on that, now, this product, I received it, I called,\n\nSpeaker 1: in the mail on the 1st, January the 1st, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I returned it on January the 2nd, so, I mean, with y'all receiving that order back, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: my account should have been adjusted.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we didn't receive it yet, that could be why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me, I could take a look for you, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we haven't received it back yet, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Still with the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: You haven't?\n\nSpeaker 1: Still with the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just left Greensboro, North Carolina's distribution center.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're saying that's where it's located at?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where it's just left, it has just arrived there at 11:23 a.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: and is on its way to another facility now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, there's really bad snowstorms and stuff throughout the country right now, so\n\nSpeaker 1: it could hinder how fast it gets here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, now, my next shipment will be when?\n\nSpeaker 1: In June, June 6th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, excellent, excellent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, as long as I know once y'all receive the order, then it will be-\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, once we receive the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, yes, it'll notate us once we get it back, once the pharmacy gets it, and we\n\nSpeaker 2: will go ahead and issue that refund to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hey, thank you, thank you very-\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually it's a lot faster, but the weather is hindering that, but go ahead, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now, even on that, too, let me ask you, for January 6th, can that $113.95, can it\n\nSpeaker 2: be credit for the next order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, it can be.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it definitely can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, now, if that can be done that way, then I would rather do it that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's just a little weird, because we can't actually process that until we get the\n\nSpeaker 1: other one, you know, and so it might be a little weird, just in that case, you know\n\nSpeaker 2: what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: We'd have to kind of be watching over it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, then, to keep from having to do that, once you receive the order, then just\n\nSpeaker 1: bill it back to my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, we can do that, yeah, we can do that, whatever's easier, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'd like to give me my name and extension as well, you can contact me directly if you\n\nSpeaker 1: do have any further questions in the future or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, even on that, as long as everything is going through the way it should, I'm fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, no, you're all set, everything is going through, everything is going through\n\nSpeaker 1: correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it, and I thank you for explaining everything in the way you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no worries, sir, no problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, anyway, you have a good rest of your day, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, you as well, sir, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh, bye.",
