Goodrich again, and as a veteran, I take a lot of pride and honor in my work, so I did exactly what you wanted, but so you just focus on your healing and your recovery.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, and the last thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges, and I paused your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I set it up for you to focus on your recovery, and if you need anything at all, my extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call the same number, 0037, my name's K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also set up the dashboard for you, so when you go to quick, when you go to scoreblue.com and you log in with your Yahoo account, there's a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a red button, white font, so in the future, when you recover, because you're a miracle, if you're not dead, God's not done with you, sir, you could click that button or call me and we'll take care of you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll make sure that we take good care of you and you live your life, and if it's not any consolation to you, sir, please do me a favor, because had I known then what I know now, look up in YouTube, Cancer, the Forbidden Cure.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a three-hour, four-hour documentary on these doctors, Cancer, the Forbidden Cure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when you go to, look up Cancer, the Forbidden Cure, it's a full documentary to help you in your journey, and that way you have questions and all that to ask in your journey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just like God says in Mark 11, 24, therefore I say to you, my brethren, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them and you will have them in Jesus' mighty name, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, I put a stop to any and all monthly refills, and I put a stop to any and all monthly charges, and I pause your prescription, and I set it up for you so when you're ready, you can give us a call because everything's paused, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. I thank you so much, and I thank you for your prayers and your thoughts.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just get better, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have to go now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet, sir. God bless you, and Godspeed, all right? Adios, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet. Adios. Bye-bye.",
