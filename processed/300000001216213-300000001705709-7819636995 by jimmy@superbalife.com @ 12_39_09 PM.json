    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd like to cancel my prescription, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me pull your information up and see what I can do for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I have some information, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Scott Collins.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Scott, I'm trying to put up with the phone number that you're calling from, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there a number?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm at work, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: My number is 508-930-5269.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Scott, appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and see what I'm looking at.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Scott, I do see that you are currently getting the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like that you're getting six of those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescriptions happen to come to you every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going on, Scott?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it coming too often, or why do you want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can always call.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I just want to check.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I want something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just cancel the whole thing right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know, we do offer that new Viagra, the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the new and improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the best of things on the market.\n\nSpeaker 1: It works faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: It lasts longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And since you already have a prescription with us, I can get that transferred over to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll tell you what I can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you out ten just to try for free, and then with that,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do that and see if you like them because you are VIP with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've been with us for quite a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will go ahead and cancel this current prescription for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you won't be getting that anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you're ready to order,\n\nSpeaker 1: you'll get this new one that I'm going to send you for free if you want to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Want to do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the new and improved, latest and greatest Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It works faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: It lasts longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it doesn't give those same side effects that Viagra used to give people,\n\nSpeaker 1: like the dizziness, the headaches, and the other situations that individuals have.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I won't have to take care of that for you and do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's try those out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, I'm giving these for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: No charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you ten of them and give you, like, about, what,\n\nSpeaker 1: four months to try these out to see if you like them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what happens after that?\n\nSpeaker 1: How much after that?\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be ten pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The total will be $49 for those.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're cheaper and they cost more.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, they're cheap and they last longer,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're much better than any ADP that's out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many milligrams is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: A hundred milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can give you a hundred milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem on that one, too, as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, it's a win-win situation for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only reason I can do it for you is to be truthful with you, Scott,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you're an existing customer and you've been with us for some time here,\n\nSpeaker 2: and these are the ones that everybody's trying to get.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're only trying to service our VIP clients like yourself,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we weren't going to get around to reaching out to you guys and tell you\n\nSpeaker 1: about these pills, but, you know, we have so many orders coming in for them,\n\nSpeaker 2: we haven't had a chance to talk to our existing customers yet about the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: But whenever they will call in to try to reorder or whatever it's going to be,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's when we'll let them know about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And no side effects or nothing?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's the whole point about this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: The side effects is zero to nothing compared to the old Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I used to have the headache and the dizziness and the stomach aches.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not going to happen with these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's for free for how long, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you ten for free at no charge, and I'm going to push it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to give you four months to try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Four months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to give you four months to try them.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not going to be on that monthly situation that you was before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, once you try them, you can order before then, and you'll get these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you want to change it to every month, we can do that, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: But otherwise, I'm pushing it out for four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: For four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let's do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to confirm I have your address at 21 Beverly Circle, Randolph.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take care of that for you right now, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the old prescription is going to be gone then, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The old prescription is gone.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to replace it with this one going forward whenever you want to\n\nSpeaker 2: order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, again, I'm going to pause it out for four months, give you time\n\nSpeaker 2: to use it, and see how these work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Did I get charged for this one, though, already?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: The last one you got charged was sent out and delivered on January 18th.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was for the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: These, I'm not charging you at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you ten for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the Cialis will be gone, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, cancel that out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I have an hour until what?\n\nSpeaker 1: April, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can tell you the exact date.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll get that for you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to trust you on this now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Look, that's why I can tell you the exact date.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second because I'm putting that order out for the ten of the\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the next scenario would be as long as you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then what happens if you call before then,\n\nSpeaker 1: it'll still push it out every four months.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the next.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you can't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: May 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me write this down.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't forget.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me write this down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I better get a good erection here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is going to be the best you've had.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trust me.\n\nSpeaker 2: You sure?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to trust you on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man, I'm telling you, you try these,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to be impressed with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then May 2nd, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, May 22nd.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you want to call by May 2nd, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, May 22nd.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got called before then, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that's what they will,\n\nSpeaker 2: the actual order would go be prepared at the pharmacy to go out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll call before May 2nd if I want to continue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care, Scott.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
