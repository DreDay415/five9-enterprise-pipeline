    "text": "Speaker 1: My husband has been trying to cancel the Score Blue and we just want to figure out how to\n\nSpeaker 2: do that because he tried to pause it in the past and it didn't work and he never signed\n\nSpeaker 1: up for a subscription to begin with, which is illegal.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we really want you to cancel it and stop with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the phone number linked to the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is your phone number linked to the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, 707-652-4007.\n\nSpeaker 2: For Mr. John McDonough?\n\nSpeaker 1: John McDonough, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I see that Mr. John has it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what happened was, it's not a subscription, but it's a prescription with refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the reason is because he got 10 tablets and it was 30 days in a month, so the doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: wanted to make sure unless he said he don't need it, he gets his refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that's what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if he don't need refill, he can pause and just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we just want to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We want to cancel it because he said to pause in the past.\n\nSpeaker 2: We even have the email chain.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they didn't pause and they kept charging.\n\nSpeaker 2: And right now, we are short on money and we have to just absolutely cancel, cancel, cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I know it's not your fault, but the fact that it's so hard, it's so easy to sign up\n\nSpeaker 2: for and so hard to cancel is, you know, deceptive consumer practices.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'd really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, you know, I think it's a great thing, but the problem is we don't have the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yes, we want to absolutely just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just be aware of, I don't know why he wasn't able to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if it was email.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what happened because everybody pauses.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's pretty easy here.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I canceled everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: That being said, you know, if anything changed, just be aware of price change due to the fact\n\nSpeaker 1: they're going to have to get you a new doctor consultation because I had to cancel the one\n\nSpeaker 2: they financed for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're kind of changing policy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but they didn't even do the pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't really, you know, I'm sure you're totally honest, but your company doesn't seem\n\nSpeaker 2: to be because you never got the pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have an email saying it was approved and he never got it and he kept getting charged\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's quite expensive.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was through emails, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That was through emails, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that was through emails.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would recommend in stuff like that, even not just reverse, but in general, make sure\n\nSpeaker 2: to have somebody over the phone to make sure because there's so many emails that's going\n\nSpeaker 1: to happen, you know, the following day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think you called, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they gave you the confirmation for email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or did you just do this through email?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was through email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just need to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And again, I know it's just your job, but your company can improve these practices,\n\nSpeaker 1: appreciate it if they would, because it's not good to get a charge which you thought\n\nSpeaker 2: wasn't going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so now it's totally canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if they could give us a credit for when they did the pause and didn't do a pause,\n\nSpeaker 1: that would be appreciated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how do I know for sure this is happening?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's completely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, you might have a price different or the order might not even go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can give you a confirmation number if that can help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send a confirmation number and the – if you could give the confirmation number\n\nSpeaker 2: and the – and email, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have an email associated with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'd really appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's the number?\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the number, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Five E-S.\n\nSpeaker 2: E-S, uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Eight F-A.\n\nSpeaker 2: Eight F-A or F-A?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's five E-S-8-F-A-4-0-C-5.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much and have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
