    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. John Meyer?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm pulling your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Mr. John.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I see that you have a prescription from Dr. Olcom for Viagra 100 mg, 10 tablets.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today, Mr. John?\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many times did you try it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, a couple of times.\n\nSpeaker 1: A couple of times?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can send you a supplement to support that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're entitled to that one time if you purchase it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's called an activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a supplement to help kind of release blockages.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get the Viagra, you get a better activation.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or I can send you a different formula of the Viagra that you receive from a different lab.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes people, based on the body chemistry, different lab works better than others.\n\nSpeaker 1: So those are the two options I have for you to try to help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather just get a refund, to be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just refuse, return to sender, and we're going to refund you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to have to cancel the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just be advised if anything changes in the future, you're probably going to have a different price\n\nSpeaker 1: because they're going to have to get you a new doctor consultation to serve you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So which is going to impact your price.\n\nSpeaker 1: I offer you what we call an activator, which is something to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because when you have ED, obviously, there's a lot of stuff going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we have what we call an activator.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually, you pair it with the Viagra to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: You help a lot of men.\n\nSpeaker 2: You decline.\n\nSpeaker 1: I offer a different formula of Viagra as well, which could be usually better.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you switch them, they get a better result.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's based on body chemistry, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Different lab, different formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: You decline as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm canceling the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I said, just write refuse, return to sender, and we're going to refund you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What address do I send that to?\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the original package by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, I do not.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do not?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So on the bottle, you have a – because I wish you would have that because you would have just to tape it\n\nSpeaker 1: and you didn't have nothing to do but just write refuse, return on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have an address on the bottle, say, 525 Alexandria Pike, Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only thing you don't have is suite 200.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just get the bottle with myself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alexandria?\n\nSpeaker 1: 525 Alexandria Pike, Suite 200, Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I need to add – I need to add suite 200?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I need to add any – just the whole bottle, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just put like a regular – you put your name, Mr. John Meyer, your address because all the boxes are there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just put your name, Mr. John Meyer, your address because all the boxes are there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just put your name, Mr. John Meyer, your address because all the boxes are there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just put like a regular – you put your name, Mr. John Meyer, your address because obviously we need to know it's coming from you\n\nSpeaker 1: and then destination, 525 Alexandria Pike, Suite 200, Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when the pharmacy receives it, usually they're pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to update the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can also call to provide if you have a tracking number so the company is able to see that it's already on the way\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you get your full refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I had inquired before there was something about a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that will be canceled also, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to care for my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, there is no subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically what you have when you get prescribed the Viagra, you get Viagra with refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now the refill, you get them a month, two months, three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's based on your need.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can even pause that prescription as well to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: But because you say that you're not going to reorder, right, you want it to be fully canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I canceled the doctor prescription and everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: If something changes in the future, just be aware of the price change because the investor,\n\nSpeaker 2: it costs money for that doctor consultation to legally send you the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you don't have it, they got to refinance again, which might impact your cost in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I was saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's great.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thanks so much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will get this in the mail as soon as possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chong.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
