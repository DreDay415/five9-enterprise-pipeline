    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I had ordered the, I think it was Viagra, Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: As advertised. Well, that's not what I got.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got Suzenafil. It's the generic brand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me help you out, Wayne. Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, date of birth is 12-11-1957.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you're right. They just, the pharmacy made an error and just sent you regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second. I'm going to send you a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I just put in a replacement order that they'll ship out to you tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this new bottle, on the bottle it's going to say AGV, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the individual pills, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the Pfizer Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now your bottle says APCO, and on your pills it has the letters AC followed by the numbers 390 or 3-something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I just know that's not what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so sometimes the pharmacy runs out of the AGV and they don't tell us, and they send generics, which causes issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I got you on there, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you sure? Because, yeah, this makes you look bad. It affects your integrity as far as I'm concerned anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because with your advertising, which you sold me, two totally different things. So, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem. I got you the correct stuff. You'll get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye. Thanks. Bye.",
