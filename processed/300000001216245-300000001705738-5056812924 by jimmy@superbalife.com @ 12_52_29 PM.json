    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this score blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Matt Cassidy, one of your customers.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is one of your customers.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Mr. Cassidy?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Could you find me your information on them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I was able to pull you up with your phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's the status of my product? What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see. It looks like that you have your account is – let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: One second here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you tried to stop your auto ships on February the 21st, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it looks like that is still on, though,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it looks like your next order is scheduled to come out February the 11th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your order is coming out February the 11th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let that one go through and then put a pause on that afterwards.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. How long would you like to pause it out for?\n\nSpeaker 2: About three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem. I'm going to take care of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I need a new address, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me go ahead and take care of that first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pause it after three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Put it out on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just changed it to three months for every three months at that point.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me make a note.\n\nSpeaker 2: After three months, put a note on there to call me\n\nSpeaker 1: or e-mail me because I might forget.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll see if I need some then or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me do this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me push it back for four.\n\nSpeaker 1: So therefore, because I don't want to tell you a guarantee\n\nSpeaker 2: that someone's going to call you because nobody sees the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be kind of hard for us to call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You understand what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, I don't want to tell you one thing and don't have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just trying to be up front as possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to be up front with you, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, really.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just kidding.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I try to take care of my clients.\n\nSpeaker 1: I really do.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll just take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said you want to change your address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I moved to New Mexico.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to get that done for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Matt, what's the new address?\n\nSpeaker 2: P.O. Box 242.\n\nSpeaker 1: P.O. Box 242.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me the zip code.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be able to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll help me out quite a bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 87715.\n\nSpeaker 1: 87715.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that looks like it's Cleveland, New Mexico.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get you set up for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's just the shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to keep the billing address the same?\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the billing?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll tell you that right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just go ahead and get that new information in there for you real quick,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'll get that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: The billing should be New Mexico.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't even know there was a Cleveland in New Mexico, believe it or not.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I do now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just like Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The billing address was 6632 Hartwood Drive.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Get rid of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want me to change it to the P.O. Box?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can do that, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm just going to confirm that's P.O. Box 242 in Cleveland, New Mexico.\n\nSpeaker 2: 87715.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anything else I can do for you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it, boss.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a wonderful weekend, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
