Hi, I was calling to place a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Lawrence Armstrong in San Francisco.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It looks like one was already discharged a little while ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you place that order, or did it refill automatically?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I did not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, it looks like one was already charged, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: It should get sent out tomorrow, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was already charged? How much was it charged?\n\nSpeaker 2: $163.95, just like the previous orders of the ATV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't order it, and I didn't know that it was charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it looks like the last time you called in was on the 25th of July,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the gentleman you spoke with mentioned that we're able to pause any future refill from now until January,\n\nSpeaker 2: so this would have been actually the due date for the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told them not to renew it until I called to have it renewed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the note that I have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's the note that I have.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not calling you a liar or anything like that, but an order has been filled,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you should be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I didn't order it, and you said it went out when?\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll go out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, I don't understand if it hasn't gone out yet because I didn't want to order that much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Has my pill already been charged?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many pills did you want to order?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know what you sent me.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many pills did you want to order?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was 40 pills like you've been ordering the past couple times.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but I'm telling you, I didn't place the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, Lawrence.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand, but I already told you the notes that I have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We mentioned that we're able to pause your prescription refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: This would have been the sixth month.\n\nSpeaker 2: But why do my prescriptions have to be automatic?\n\nSpeaker 1: To keep the prescription alive, it needs to have at least one refill set for the year.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure if he mentioned that to you, but that's the only way to keep prescriptions active and alive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, this prescription will be for the year.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would like for you to make a note in my account,\n\nSpeaker 1: do not charge my account unless authorized by me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: We need to have at least one refill set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, that's not what you told me.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just told me one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, look, send this order and cancel me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Send this order and cancel me.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I need some more, I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, good luck.\n\nSpeaker 1: So send this order and cancel me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you please put that in the notes so that there's going to be no misunderstanding?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, already done.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.",
