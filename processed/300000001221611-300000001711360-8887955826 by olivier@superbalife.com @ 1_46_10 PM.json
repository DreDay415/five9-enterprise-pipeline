    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello, your name's Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Viagra Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, this is Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just ordered online from Scor-Blue 20 tablets of Viagra AGVs.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's supposed to be 100 mg, 100 mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what I got, I just got it, is just regular Sildenafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, may I have the phone number linked to your prescription so I can fix that for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: What phone number do you need?\n\nSpeaker 1: The phone number that you used to open the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: 435-760-0143.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. J. Farnsbeck?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me see. Give me a moment to look up your account by name.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you say you got it wrong.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you pick up one of the pills and tell me what is engraved on the pill, the engraving, the numbers, the code?\n\nSpeaker 1: It says something AC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, that's the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should see 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you a replacement. Don't mix them together. It's two different formulas.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm going to send you is the AGVs, the improved formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to see 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I thought I bought, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't know why the order came like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy just fulfilled what they received, but maybe that was a glitch on the website.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe a lot of orders coming at the same time, but that's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what we're here for.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a replacement, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would appreciate that, because I really want to try whatever this AGV is, and that's not what it means.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, diamond-shaped pill. It's going to say 5-0.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's completely different. Don't mix them together.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so let me get you a replacement here, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: But are you going to send me 50 mg pills or 100 mg pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: 50 mg pills, yeah. That's what your prescription says.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the advertisement that I purchased them from says that they were going to be 100 mg ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we have 50 and 100, but apparently you ordered the 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: But nonetheless, you can take two at a time, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to send you 25 instead of 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to get five extra pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: You pay for 20, but you're going to get five extra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you start with the med, take one and see, and then you can double the dose, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So you introduce your body to the med and see how it reacts, so you can get double the dose.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get up to two to make it 100, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's when these came and said 50s.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought, well, maybe they're so that you can start out the lower dose.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and you can double it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't want to take too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't want to take too much or you're going to get defeated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then also, if I can share that with you, some patients sometimes say, oh, I'll get that med.\n\nSpeaker 1: But not necessarily the AGV, but in general, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So some med, when you take them for the first time, you might feel like, oh, do I get side effects or stuff like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it's new to the body, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The body doesn't really know, so it can get triggered, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So now, when you micro-dose it, you go progressively.\n\nSpeaker 2: The body gets used to it, and it works fine for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: But some people want to go really fast and, you know, want a miracle overnight and overdose it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it just, you know, creates that bother your system instead of doing the job.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can start with 50, and then you can double the dose, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only concern I had is I've tried the other.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've tried the regular Viagra, and it works all right, but I just wanted to...\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered this because I wanted to try the new and improved one, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the new formula, newest formula, faster activation, lasts longer, less to no side effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: The best on the market right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: It can be a great help for you, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to ship you even more pills than what you paid for, 25 pills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it's going to be the AGV, it's going to say five zero on a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have a different medical code, and then, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can keep what you have as a backup.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's FDA approved as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, you have a total of 45 pills, total 20 as a regular generic,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then 25 will be the AGV, all that sound.\n\nSpeaker 2: Geez, I might be able to have a little fun, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I would appreciate that if I have to send her back, fine,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'd just like to get what I paid for.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what I'm getting you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the newest formula you're going to receive, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Use them separately so you can compare.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the best version I'm sending you, 25 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all set for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: What address did you send them to?\n\nSpeaker 1: 6022 West Highway 36 Western, 83286.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll work.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's my old address.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to put a new address in the system?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just it helps the post office a little better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's put a new address.\n\nSpeaker 2: My new address is 4104 South.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, 4104?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, 4104 South.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: 5600 West.\n\nSpeaker 1: I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said South?\n\nSpeaker 1: South.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4104 South.\n\nSpeaker 1: South, like S-O-U-C-H.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, or just a capital letter S will work, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I couldn't hear properly what you were saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, yeah, 4104 South.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5600 West, Clarkston, C-L-A-R-K-S-T-O-N, Clarkston Road.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Clarkston.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you spell the last one again, C-L-A-C-K?\n\nSpeaker 1: C-L-A-R-K, like Clark, S-T-O-N, Clarkston, Clarkston Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I never see an address like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, 4104 South, 5600 West, Clarkston Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Still the same zip code, 83286.\n\nSpeaker 2: Still the same zip.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's Weston.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's still the same city, Weston.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I doubt.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's just I got a new home.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just got a new home a couple miles down the road, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, and...\n\nSpeaker 2: And now, the billing.\n\nSpeaker 1: The billing is that new one as well?\n\nSpeaker 2: The billing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Should I change it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or are you still on the old one?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the billing should be the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my new permanent address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, for billing and for shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you want to keep that new address you just gave me for billing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I should update the billing as well, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the billing and the new address is the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I'm doing that for you here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, everything has been updated.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I have 4104 South, 5100 West, Clarkston Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: 56.\n\nSpeaker 1: 56.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whoa, whoa, back up again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 56.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 56 I have here.\n\nSpeaker 2: West Clarkston Road, Weston, Idaho, 83286.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, once again, 4104 South, 5600 West Clarkston Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Weston, Idaho, 83286.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, everything looks great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Phone number will be the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: How soon can you get that sent out?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because in the ad it says they can deliver it in two days, but this took two weeks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so after the doctor writes the prescription, I mean, you have a prescription already,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it should take two to five days a day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the prescription going to go to the same place as Go-Go Meds?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's coming from Go-Go Meds, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why the heck did they—\n\nSpeaker 2: Hmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: What happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just wondered why they sent me the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, so what I was explaining is that maybe when you placed your order,\n\nSpeaker 1: maybe it was a backlog of orders on the website,\n\nSpeaker 2: so the full spec of what you were trying to order didn't come.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just came as regular.\n\nSpeaker 2: But nonetheless, that's what we're here for,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's why we're making the adjustment for you because you're talking to customer service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because those things are going to happen regardless.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever company, things happen, but we're here to resolve as quickly as we can.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, we'll look forward to trying that new and improved stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I hope it works better than this other.\n\nSpeaker 2: That would be wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what we want.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'll assume that within the next two to five days I might have some.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, everything sounds good, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was easy.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was easier than I thought, and I hope that it goes smooth, just like our conversation.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, you got our number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any help you might need, we're here to serve you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for calling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, bye.",
