Let me, let me pull your prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Ronald Goode in Mason Town?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Goode, I see that Dr. Fries wrote you a prescription for Viagra 50 mg, 10 tablets every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't need your refill, Mr. Goode, I can advise the pharmacy to stop the initial prescription of every 30 days\n\nSpeaker 1: and you can just order as needed instead by calling or logging into your account\n\nSpeaker 2: because you're not required to get every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's just the initial written prescription because you get 10 tablets and it's 30 days during the month, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can tell the pharmacy to stop the initial written prescription for 30 days and you're just going to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: They put the prescription up to half a year so you don't have monthly, basically, but you lock your price in, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so, so I, I can still get, I can't take it for six months, that's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: The doctor told me not to take it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes. Yeah, I can post that like that. You can get your refill later on.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to get it as often though. You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: They won't, they won't, they won't bill me no more, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no. They post you up to half a year. You can reorder yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe you can get it once or twice a year just to keep your price up, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But not every 30 days if you don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if it happens that you need it every 30 days, just let us know, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because COBLU gives you a VIP status where you can manage your prescription at your liking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do that for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, everything is paused for half a year. Give us a call to reorder, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. You have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
