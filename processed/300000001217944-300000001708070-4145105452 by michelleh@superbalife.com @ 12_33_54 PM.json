    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Actually, I'm trying to get some information about your advertisement for the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we are the only company that's contracted directly with Pfizer with their manufacturer in France called Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: To provide the FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it took Pfizer about 10 years to come up with this formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's the inactive ingredients that, okay, it kicks in faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: People are saying they feel it kick in in about 11 to 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: But on the bottle, it will say take one hour prior to get the best results.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it lasts in your system longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It lasts in your system for 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: And less side effects are being reported, especially less headaches and that flushed feeling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ask you, how is it different than Viagra that's on the market right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: either the brand name or the generic name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it's the inactive ingredients in Pfizer's AGV that makes it more powerful.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the best way for me to describe it is say if you had two cups of water and you had a generic Viagra\n\nSpeaker 1: and you had an AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: You put the generic in a cup of water, it's going to dissolve in 30 seconds.\n\nSpeaker 1: You put the AGV in a cup of water, it's going to dissolve in two to three minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that means when you swallow it, it allows it more time to get down to your member\n\nSpeaker 1: and work more effectively.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other question I have, I have type 2 diabetes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is this supposedly helping with that a little bit more than the generic or the brand name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it should, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people have type 2 diabetes and it works out great for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the other question I have is ordering it with you people, am I locked into refills\n\nSpeaker 1: or can that be just one order?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what happens is it does put you on automatic refills, but you don't have to have that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what you can do is a lot of people just like to go ahead and put that on a six-month hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and your profile open with the doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: and just allows you to call in.\n\nSpeaker 2: You kind of cut out there for a little while so I didn't hear what you said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does come with automatic refills, but you don't have to have it set up that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have the option, a lot of people just like to go ahead and pause their refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it just keeps your prescription active and allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because every time people cancel, we have to end the cancel and then they call back to place another order,\n\nSpeaker 2: we have to pay the doctor's.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to pay the doctor's fees, we cover that, but we have to pay them.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why it's just better to pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Speaking of doctor, as I potentially would fill this prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: do I have to see a doctor or is it just through your support staff?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what happens is I take your order and I ask you a couple questions for the doctors to review.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have licensed doctors.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then once you place your order, they will review your profile\n\nSpeaker 1: and we need a list of all the medications, like prescription medications you're on.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you have any questions, you can reach out to the clinician,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if they have any questions, they'll reach out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once they approve your prescription, it goes to our pharmacy called Go-Go Meds in Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they ship it out to you from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: They will email you a tracking number, and you usually get it in about five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: And is there a fee?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I have to pay for that doctor review of the information?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we cover the doctor's fees.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy just charges a $14.95 processing fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we have a quantity of 40 for $149, with the pharmacy fee comes out to $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we have a quantity of 25 for $99, with the fee comes out to $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then they also come in 25, 50, and 100 milligrams, and it's all the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I always say you should just go for the hundreds, and you can break them in half if you need to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had called a couple weeks ago, and the price that you're offering now is significantly higher than what I heard before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because they didn't include the pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, actually, it was even with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was told for 10 tablets, it would be approximately $40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 10 tablets is $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: With the pharmacy processing fee, it comes out to $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you've answered my questions, and I'll review it and call back to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
