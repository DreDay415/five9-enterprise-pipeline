What's your last name and zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: All that's a les.\n\nSpeaker 1: 07 066.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. I pulled up your account here, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do want to mention you're currently a VIP member for the Cialis at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: I cancel these orders out, sir. Unfortunately, the doctor would delete the visit.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you wouldn't be able to access these anymore. What I could always do for you though is put you in our six-month freeze plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can always call us when you need it or call us to delay and still have access to it for when?\n\nSpeaker 1: You need it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the first one do?\n\nSpeaker 1: If we start every order and it freezes out every charge, you won't be billed for anything whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when you are ready to get it,\n\nSpeaker 1: You could just call us and we'll send one out or you could call us and delay it for another half a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what the six-month freeze plan does for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I'll go ahead and set you up for that and you're all set, sir. At any point call us if you have any questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatsoever, but you're all good to go for today. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, are you gonna send like a confirmation email or what? I don't see it on your actual dashboard.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's gonna just update there, and it'll show you the reflected date, and it also saves a conversation from today on here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye. Bye.",
