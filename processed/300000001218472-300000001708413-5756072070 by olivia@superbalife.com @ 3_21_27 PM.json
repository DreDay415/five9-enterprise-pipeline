    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling BIACRA, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Aurelio Vigil, how are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good Aurelio, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, I love to hear it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I placed an order and everything was going, everything was being shipped,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the last one that I got, it showed up to Eunice, New Mexico,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it said insufficient address, and it said ship back to sender,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I mean, I'm nowhere near Eunice, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let me pull up your tracking number and see about all this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you confirm your date of birth for me, Aurelio?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's April 12, 1978.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your address would be PO Box 172, Fort Sumner, New Mexico, 88119?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's see about this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you're right, the package was returned to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, I don't like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so here's what we're going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to make a note of that for whatever bizarre reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why do you think, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: I wonder why you would have done that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have no clue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, Eunice isn't even close to Fort Sumner.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so here's what I would say.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can reship these to you, and I'm happy to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm wondering, my concern is if they took them to your PO Box\n\nSpeaker 1: and for whatever reason they said, we're not delivering these here,\n\nSpeaker 2: we're returning to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, but it never got to my post office box.\n\nSpeaker 2: The whole tracking deal never got to Fort Sumner.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know that that's possible, though,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they wouldn't return it to sender if it hadn't gotten there\n\nSpeaker 1: and they didn't have a reason to return it to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm totally with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, like I say, the whole tracking deal, I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: it went to everywhere else but Fort Sumner, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so let me just finish my thought,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we'll see where we can go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So my concern is that if they did return to sender with this PO Box,\n\nSpeaker 1: they might have some sort of issue delivering to this PO Box,\n\nSpeaker 2: which makes me wonder if it would be safer to deliver it to you at, say,\n\nSpeaker 1: a home address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can put my home address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so what is your home address?\n\nSpeaker 1: 879 Sharp Street.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's Fort Sumner, everything else is all the same?\n\nSpeaker 2: Fort Sumner, New Mexico, 88119.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you spell your street name for me, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: S-H-A-R-P, Sharp.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so 879 Sharp Street, Fort Sumner, New Mexico, 88119.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: 879 Sharp Street, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so here's what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to reship this, and I'm going to do it with do you feel good about if I\n\nSpeaker 2: send it with a signature so that you would definitely receive it and have to\n\nSpeaker 1: sign for it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm not, but I mean, the guy that delivers here, he knows just to leave it\n\nSpeaker 1: where he leaves it, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: He's good at what he does.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so then this should be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you did the H-E-V, it's 100 milligrams, perfect, perfect, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I get this shipped any faster than that, being that it's not, you know, I've\n\nSpeaker 2: been waiting for a while or no?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let me, I will message shipping, and I will ask them to send it out\n\nSpeaker 2: priority immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, because they ship out of Kentucky, they've left for the day.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll tell them first thing in the morning to get it out with priority to\n\nSpeaker 1: 879 Sharp Street, Fort Sumner, New Mexico, 88119.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect, and this is going to be a 50 pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, there's just a lot of different notes I'm going to need to make, but\n\nSpeaker 2: that's totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, you should get these by, I mean, winter storm pending, because\n\nSpeaker 2: unfortunately we ship out of Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually I'd say you'll definitely get them by Thursday or Friday at the latest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd say winter storm pending, even with the priority, you'll probably get them\n\nSpeaker 1: Thursday through Saturday, Monday or Tuesday at the very latest, but unlikely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, thank you so much, Aurelio.\n\nSpeaker 1: I love your name.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day, and I hope you enjoy these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry they, like, got returned to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's really weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: At a post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just because Eunice is way on the other side of New Mexico.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, very bizarre.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for helping me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
