    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good, thank you for asking. How are we doing, sir? Mr. Ricky Norton.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ricky Marcus?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, how are we doing, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: We're doing pretty good. I was wanting to just continue the deals or either maybe switch them to the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which one? Which one do you want to switch it for?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is it? The Viagra instead of the Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because you're getting Cialis, so you want the Viagra instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, does that work better?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it depends. We've got to try and be able to assess. How is the Cialis for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: How is the Cialis for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I requested. I was thinking...\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that better?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that better?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. Thank you so much. So, I was saying that you say you want to switch. So, I see you have Cialis 10 mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you say you want to switch for what? Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's the same price. I hope they know us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. But then here's the question. Does Cialis work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: The Cialis, it did somewhat, but it didn't... I don't think it did all that. I mean...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you have 10 mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was thinking the Cialis...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can double that, though. You have 10 mg, but you could double that for better results, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you cannot do 3, but you can go up to 20 mg, because you have 10 mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you ever tried to take 2 pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. I didn't want to do that. No.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you can. The maximum dose is 20 mg. You can do that. That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You cannot do 30, 25, but you can do 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because we have 20 mg pills. You're getting 10 mg, so that's an option.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just saying as far as Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, if you want to order the new Viagra AGV, I can get you a good deal of 10 pills for 49.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to come to 63.95 total.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you took Viagra in the past. Is Viagra a good fit for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I took it in the past before, and it seemed like it did pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was thinking that Cialis is a little bit weaker, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Yeah, because what happened was those things work with body chemistry,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you've got to try them and see which one is for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: For some reason, for men, it's either Cialis or Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your body reacts better for one of them, so everybody is like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could be a Viagra guy, maybe I'm a Cialis guy, and vice versa.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just what it is for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you said Viagra was pretty good in the past, let's do some Viagra AGV now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in mind when we switch like that with the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 1: because we're going to have a doctor writing a new prescription for you\n\nSpeaker 2: in the next few hours with Viagra, because obviously you cannot use the Cialis prescription for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to have to stick with Viagra a little bit,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the pharmacy doesn't like to swap back and forth between meds like that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, so let me get you, I'm going to request a medicine change,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you want 10 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want 100mg or 50mg, or 25mg?\n\nSpeaker 1: What was the Cialis? What milligram was that?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that was different. The Cialis was 10mg, and you could have 20mg,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is the maximum for Cialis is 20mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you can take 25, 50, or 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually it's safe to take 50, and then if it's not potent enough, you can go up to 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: As you can see, those meds are designed differently.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll just try the 50 again.\n\nSpeaker 2: 50, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the card on file ending by 7463 is a good one,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the shipping address 339 Forest View Lane is good to keep?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, I'm proceeding right now, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It got declined.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: The transaction was declined.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I think I got the card locked, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got to use my telephone to go in and unlock it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, perfect. That's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will you want to hold on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, do your thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are here to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: For expedited shipping,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can get either next day,\n\nSpeaker 2: tomorrow,\n\nSpeaker 1: or Thursday,\n\nSpeaker 2: or $30 on the second day,\n\nSpeaker 1: or $30 on the third day,\n\nSpeaker 2: or a priority mail by Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you can try now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was able to successfully place your order,\n\nSpeaker 1: 10p50mg Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, next few hours,\n\nSpeaker 1: the doctor is going to write a new prescription for now,\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra instead of Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when the order goes out,\n\nSpeaker 2: as you know, you're a previous patient,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to receive a tracking number in email,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can anticipate your delivery, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, thank you for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
