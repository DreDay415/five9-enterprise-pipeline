    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling THIACRA, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, can you spell your name for me please?\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't get it correctly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: O-L-I-V-A?\n\nSpeaker 1: O-L-I-V-I-A.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there's two I's, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you for that, I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia, I have some strong, strong concerns.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered your product on the 12th of January,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I received that on the 14th,\n\nSpeaker 1: I received it somewhere around the 16th,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I tried it, and it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when I called back on like the 18th, 19th,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the guy told me on the phone,\n\nSpeaker 1: oh, you know what, we shipped out the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was kind of appalled, and he says,\n\nSpeaker 1: but we'll ship out the correct stuff to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I said, no, at this point, I just want to get my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was kind of frustrated.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the guy was kind of a little rude,\n\nSpeaker 1: and he says, well, we can get you the right stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I says, no, I just want my money back, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've already tried something that you guys advertised,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it wasn't what you advertised.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he said at that point, he canceled my account,\n\nSpeaker 2: and he said that the money will be returned to my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that was like on the 19th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I waited, nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I called back again on the 21st,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I spoke to a gentleman by the name of Ollie.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Ollie said, oh, no problem, we're gonna refund\n\nSpeaker 2: your account, I see where your account was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me about a day or two, because it was late,\n\nSpeaker 2: and nobody's here to give you an email.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I was kind of appalled by that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I says, okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I waited to today, today is the 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: I called again, and again, I got a hold of this guy\n\nSpeaker 1: by the name of Ollie, and I'm questioning him\n\nSpeaker 2: about what he told me on the 21st.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he gives me the same story.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, let me go see if somebody can email you,\n\nSpeaker 1: showing that your account has been credited.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I, oh, no, he comes back.\n\nSpeaker 1: He says, well, there's nobody here to do that,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I think you're doing too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he hung up the phone in my face.\n\nSpeaker 2: And now I call back, and I get you, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying my best not to write about your company.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying my best.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to put your company out there on social media\n\nSpeaker 2: where I have a huge, huge, huge following.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't believe in doing nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe in trying my best to work it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's unfortunate that I've gotten around.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what is, so I don't have a reference point\n\nSpeaker 1: for any of this, because we didn't,\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't get that from you,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is ideally where the call would have started.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what is the phone number associated\n\nSpeaker 1: with your prescription, so I can see\n\nSpeaker 2: all of which you've just walked me through?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's 510-472-5296.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Clifford Jackson, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1: interesting, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you spoke with him today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you spoke with him a week ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the point is, I just don't like to be mishandled.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way he talked to me and was nasty to me\n\nSpeaker 1: and hung up the phone in my face,\n\nSpeaker 2: that exhausted all options at that point.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't know it can be that serious\n\nSpeaker 2: over $69 that I get mistreated like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so here's what I can tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you said nothing and you called\n\nSpeaker 1: and I asked for your information\n\nSpeaker 2: and I just typed it in and I go to see your page,\n\nSpeaker 1: my perspective is like if I were looking at it\n\nSpeaker 2: the way my boss would or as a salesperson\n\nSpeaker 1: as opposed to like me as a human or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 2: I just look at it and be like,\n\nSpeaker 1: oh, this person ordered from us,\n\nSpeaker 2: they received a product from us,\n\nSpeaker 1: we refunded it and then I have notes\n\nSpeaker 2: from more than one person that say\n\nSpeaker 1: that you were really angry and were threatening them\n\nSpeaker 2: and all of these other things.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I would be confused about that,\n\nSpeaker 2: especially because at least according to what I'm looking at\n\nSpeaker 1: it's as if you've never spent money with us\n\nSpeaker 2: because the thing you did spend money on\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you called and understandably,\n\nSpeaker 2: you were like, hey, this wasn't the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think the AGV is what I ordered\n\nSpeaker 2: and the person you spoke with said,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay, well, let's get you the right pills\n\nSpeaker 2: and you said, no, this is not what I want,\n\nSpeaker 1: I refuse, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we just gave you your money back, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But then you called us back, yeah and the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, I do understand what you're saying\n\nSpeaker 1: but I would be confused about what you would write about\n\nSpeaker 2: because like I mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's as if you've never spent money with us before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Olivia, first of all,\n\nSpeaker 1: being angry and cussing somebody out over the phone\n\nSpeaker 2: or in person is not even my temperament.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I did that, I would be doing that to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's not even my temperament.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a receipt on my credit card that I can fax to you\n\nSpeaker 2: and showed you that I pay for consultation\n\nSpeaker 1: and I pay for pharmacists or whatever it was\n\nSpeaker 2: that they charge me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do have the pills that I can take a picture of\n\nSpeaker 2: and I can also send you and show you\n\nSpeaker 1: that these was not the pills that I paid for\n\nSpeaker 2: in terms of what you guys need.\n\nSpeaker 1: In terms of what you guys is advertising,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it was the AGD and when it frustrated me\n\nSpeaker 1: because if you're advertising the AGD,\n\nSpeaker 2: there should be nowhere that I should have received\n\nSpeaker 1: the actual salinity pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not sure, I'm not in charge of what you guys write.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not in charge of that\n\nSpeaker 2: but I am in charge of what I pay you guys\n\nSpeaker 1: and I do have a right to ask for a refund\n\nSpeaker 2: if it doesn't work out according to your stipulations\n\nSpeaker 1: that's advertised on social media\n\nSpeaker 2: that I can screenshot and send to you as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not sure what your people is writing.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're probably frustrated because I'm calling\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm asking for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: You already got a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have had a refund since the moment you called in,\n\nSpeaker 2: you've had a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see how you're yelling?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my question, Clifford.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see how you're yelling?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not yelling.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have, this is a lot of time\n\nSpeaker 2: I've spent on this call with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's over eight minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I got the right to ask my questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've not yelled at you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That you've had a refund for a very long time.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have the right to be on the phone\n\nSpeaker 1: and ask for a refund that my credit card is not showing?\n\nSpeaker 2: You've already received a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do not have a refund, sweetie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are the only options of what I can offer you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you call back, another person will pick up\n\nSpeaker 2: and will tell you the exact same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can I speak to a supervisor?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or can I write into someone?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have the right to speak to a supervisor\n\nSpeaker 1: because I'm not upset.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're upset.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're doing exactly what the other guys are doing.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going by what they wrote,\n\nSpeaker 1: as if what they're writing is gold.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have three people,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're telling me three people lied?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm telling you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm telling you, Olivia,\n\nSpeaker 2: that I paid for something that I didn't get.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that was the lie right there.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm sharing with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was the reason why I said, no, I don't want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I have the space for you to repeat yourself\n\nSpeaker 1: one more time and one time only.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, just give me the space.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just give me.",
