    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Baselzite. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sean Norton.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Mr. Norton. What can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered Baselzite on the 22nd of November, and I still haven't received my order. I was just wondering where it could possibly be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gotcha. Oh, I'm so sorry about that. Let me just double check for you. I mean, we anticipated delays with the Postal Service, but it shouldn't be that far out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a moment. And if you don't mind, can you just verify your address for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: 4789 Sloop Road, East Jordan, Michigan, 49727.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. So this shipped out on the 24th. You may want to – let me just double check and make sure this is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: You might want to check your mailbox now. It was delivered at 3:07 p.m. your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, cool. So it should be in the mailbox then?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what it says.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because it said UPS. It was coming in UPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. It's USPS, U.S. Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you so much.",
