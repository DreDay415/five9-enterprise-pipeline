    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra at ScoreGlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Terry Colvin and I placed an order for Viagra for a second time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's supposed to be shipped, United States Postal Service?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was looking up the tracking number and then it says FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to my post office box. Can you check on that for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I can, Mr. Colvin. Could you confirm your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, August 29, 1952.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I do see here it's set to arrive today, and you're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is being shipped to your PO box.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I look up the tracking number, the reason why I'm calling you is because\n\nSpeaker 1: I had an order shipped out, I think it was on the 8th of this month,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it never got here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I called last week and I changed the delivery to, what is it, a three-day delivery?\n\nSpeaker 2: What did I change that to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so it looks like you did the two-day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two-day. So my question, and I think there was an additional fee to that,\n\nSpeaker 1: but when I check, when I look at the tracking ID, why does it come up FedEx?\n\nSpeaker 2: So when doing FedEx, that's the only way you can do express shipping,\n\nSpeaker 1: with one-day or two-day air.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will it go to my post office box, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: It should, or usually the post office will hold it if it's not in your PO box.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so they didn't give me, I sent my wife,\n\nSpeaker 1: I was expecting bills and we have a post office box in Bozeman,\n\nSpeaker 2: and she said it wasn't in the post office box.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should I have her stand in line and check on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, looking here, it looks like it's going to be delivered before 5 p.m. Bozeman time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that does give it, I'd say, like an hour or so, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it should be there by the end of the day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm only asking because it came up FedEx and I'm not knowledgeable about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I really, I wanted it registered so I'd have to sign for it,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that's not the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: You couldn't offer that to a PO box, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir, because it would just be dropped off at the PO box because you're not always there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes what happens is they do drop it off with the representative who is working.\n\nSpeaker 1: So say it's at a post office with a PO box, they'll drop it off at the post office,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you have to sign for it with them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but there was no notification.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you answered my question, so I guess it is going to my post office box,\n\nSpeaker 1: and FedEx is the only way I can get two-day air, and it should show up sometime today, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have no idea why my last order that I ordered on the 8th of the month,\n\nSpeaker 2: well, actually it was on the 6th, it was supposed to be shipped, I never got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm wondering if it was stolen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I've had problems like that before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I thank you for your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I appreciate it.
