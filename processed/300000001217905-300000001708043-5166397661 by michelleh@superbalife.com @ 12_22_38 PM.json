    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you guys keep charging me for my subscription, but I sent in emails and I called back in. I want to say it was November.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you, Raymond. I can help you. Can you just confirm your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1678.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you have to call in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just went ahead and canceled out that refill for you, so you'll be seeing $113.95 back on your credit card in about five business days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, Raymond, how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't work. That's why I've been trying to cancel it, which I've called before to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's why I'm asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it looks like the pharmacy made an error and sent you just the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did not receive the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second. How many orders do you have?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you out the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to replace it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've had multiple orders, and it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I called you, but never mind.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't do it. Never mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying to talk to you and explain something, and it just keeps cutting me off.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I have nothing to say. Am I canceled?\n\nSpeaker 2: How do I know I'm canceled? Can I get an email?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get some kind of proof?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because this isn't the first time.\n\nSpeaker 1: This isn't the first time y'all did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last month, last time y'all sent me this stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: y'all just told me I didn't cancel it properly,\n\nSpeaker 2: blah, blah, blah, and sent me this stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I have it sitting here wasting away.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, so I'm definitely going to help you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just counting how many orders you have of the incorrect stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's 25, 50, 75, 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what I'm going to do,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you out the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second, and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because that's not cool. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Okay, so I put in a replacement order free of cost because we sent you the incorrect medication in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get this new bottle, on the bottle, it's going to say AGV, but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the FDA-approved Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now, your bottles say APCO, and on your pills, it has AC imprinted on it, followed by, like, 390 or 340.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the most quantity,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to put a quantity of 100 in the notes for the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm going to give you my extension\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can call me back and let me know if they gave, you know, if they sent you the correct quantity.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm also, I have to pause your refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause them for six months until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I'll just give you my extension\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can call me back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I cancel you out now,\n\nSpeaker 1: it will delete your profile and the pharmacy wouldn't be able to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I want to get you your correct medication that you've been paying for.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, do you have a pen for my extension?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it's 0020, and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so I have to wait until I get this new stuff and call back to cancel again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now you won't have to sit on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry, you've been receiving the wrong medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: And sorry I cut you off earlier.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just, I noticed what you were going to say,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I called multiple times to cancel because it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I just keep being told it's canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't see any notes here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see notes that you emailed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I emailed, and then they sent me an email back to call this number, and I called this number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and we're on Pacific Standard Time,\n\nSpeaker 1: so we're open 8 to 5.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know if maybe you're going after hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now that you have my extension,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'll go first to my call list.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm here 8 to 3 Pacific Standard Time.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and also give me a call back if there's not 100 in the jar,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I can send you the rest, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, Raymond.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good week.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good week.",
