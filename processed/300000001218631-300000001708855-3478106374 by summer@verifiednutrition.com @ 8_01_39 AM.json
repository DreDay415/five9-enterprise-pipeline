    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling customer service. I can help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hi. I have a problem and I sent some emails and I've been trying to get through and this is the first time I actually was able to get through. I actually ordered the product Score Blue and it gave me kind of hot flashes and stuff, my nose up pretty bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you wrote them about it and they said to try a little lower dose?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, but I did and it didn't help me. So I canceled the order. Then all of a sudden, a couple of days ago on Friday, I seen the charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you tried to call but obviously you didn't get through, and then the weekend and yesterday you couldn't get through?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. But actually, the email I wrote them, I said I canceled and the girl in the email told me to call this number and you could cancel over the phone, but I was already charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10465.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your name's Lewis Bartolotti?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I have your account up here. What did you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I did cancel the item weeks ago and all of a sudden I noticed that I got a charge. So when I sent the email about the charge, they told me that I had to call this number and you guys will take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what are we taking?\n\nSpeaker 2: What? I'm sorry, so you want us to—\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to return the package that's on the way to you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I never got the package. I only got charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow. Now what do I do? I can't—I can't even—I have the rest of the pills left from the lesson.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't take them and I actually called.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really? Okay, I'll keep them in the same package. How do I send them back?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't open it and give it back to the mail person.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's gonna be hard for me to do unless I see him.\n\nSpeaker 2: Drop it off at the mail, at the USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I—without a return—\n\nSpeaker 2: Or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you'll use the same—\n\nSpeaker 2: The same.\n\nSpeaker 1: The same postage, don't open it and drop it back off. Okay, and then when you get it back, you'll credit me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a nice day.",
