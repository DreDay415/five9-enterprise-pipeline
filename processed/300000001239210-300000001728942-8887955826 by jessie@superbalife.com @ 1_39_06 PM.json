    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie, may I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Garth Bratcher.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Mr. Bratcher, if you don't mind, can you just spell your last name for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, B-R-A-T-C-H-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And then what is your zip code, Mr. Bratcher?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 93291.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, Garth Bratcher. And are you at 1046 North Atwood Street, Visalia, California?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you wanted to cancel your monthly dues, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just want to be able to call in and order when I need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, let me do this for you then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can set it to on demand, so you can just call whenever you feel like it, and you won't get anything in the mail unless you place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just bear in mind, though, to keep the prescription active, if after six months you don't place a refill, the system will send one refill to you just to keep your prescription active, OK?\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You won't get anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is a refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: This one, you were getting it at 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's $49.\n\nSpeaker 1: After taxes and fees and everything else, it's $63.95 for the 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't want to get that one at six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure how much I like them.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm still in my thoughts.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: So go ahead and cancel me completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why don't we do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, Mr. Bratcher, if you don't mind, I want to step in really quickly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once we cancel your prescription, you can't get the medication anymore because the prescription is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: My suggestion would be this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try it first.\n\nSpeaker 1: See if it's a fit for you or if you like it or anything else, that kind of fun stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you truly think that it is not a fit for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: right, because the jury's still out and we don't know whether it's a fit for you or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it really isn't, then call us back and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: But otherwise, keep it open until you are sure because once we cancel that prescription, you can't get medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's that straightforward.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think I'm just going to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just bear in mind, though, like I said, once I cancel this prescription, we can't re-up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it's just like going to your doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once the prescription is done, you can't just go to the pharmacy and get another refill for the same prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's kaput.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why I'm saying try the pills first.\n\nSpeaker 1: See what you like rather than having to go through this whole hullabaloo with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll tell you what.\n\nSpeaker 1: It has the name on top.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead and put me on a thing where I won't get sent one until six months and I'll let you know if I don't like them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll put that in the notes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you are all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
