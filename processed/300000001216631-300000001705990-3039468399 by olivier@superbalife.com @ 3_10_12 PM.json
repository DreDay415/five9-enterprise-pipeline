    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Yes, this is Mike Houston. How are you doing today? Good, Mr. Michael.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pulling your prescription. Thank you for asking. Where are you located? California.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the medical consultant office, but the pharmacy is in Kentucky. Okay. Where are\n\nSpeaker 2: you located? California, Los Angeles. Okay. So no snow? No snow, no. We live in California.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have that problem, you know. Well, you do up high. You do up high. Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know we got other problems probably, but snow is not one of them. But if you need snow,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you need snow, you can still get it. You go in Big Bear. It's two hours from L.A.\n\nSpeaker 2: In a mountain, you get snow, you can ski. We're doing crispies. All incredible is there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's pretty cool, isn't it? Yes, it's good, yes. Are you in Littleton, Connecticut?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Okay. Yes, I was able to pull your prescription. I see you have Viagra on the pedigree prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: written by Dr. Hill, Alyson Hill. Yes. How may I assist you, Mr. Towson?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to cancel it. Oh, you just don't need it as often? Or any health concerns?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I just don't care to do it anymore. Oh, okay. All right. Yes, because you have\n\nSpeaker 2: the option to pause and reorder. But if you're sure you're not going to reorder, I'm going\n\nSpeaker 1: to toss your consultation. That being said, if you reorder in the future, the only thing\n\nSpeaker 2: is because they're going to have to get you a new one to provide you the Viagra legally,\n\nSpeaker 1: it might change your price. That's the only thing. That's why they offer you to pause\n\nSpeaker 2: it, so you don't receive pay for anything, but you can reorder, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Nope, I just don't care for it. Thank you. Oh, okay. Yes, I'm canceling everything\n\nSpeaker 2: here. All right, everything has been canceled, doctor prescription, the VIP account, and\n\nSpeaker 1: you're good to go, Mr. Michael. All right, sir. I appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. You have a good one. You as well. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
