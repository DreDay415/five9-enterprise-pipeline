    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Joanna speaking, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: This message has been transcribed. One moment while I notify...\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you today, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. I received my score blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm David Donahue, and I put down the 100 milligram Viagra, and I got 50 milligram solanofil.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I paid for the blue. What went wrong there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir. Can I get your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-8-53.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-8-53. Okay, thank you, Mr. Donahue. I do have your account pulled up here, and can you read to me what it says on the tablet of the Viagra that you received?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. It says solanofil, citrate, 50 milligram tablets, generic for Viagra, and I ordered the blue pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you pull that out and see what it says?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I got my glasses on, and I can't tell what it is, but it don't say nothing about Viagra, especially the A-G-V, or is that how you pronounce it? It does not have any of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's what I ordered, and I ordered 100 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. I'm going to get that resolved for you. Don't worry. I'm going to take care of you. I'm going to send you a replacement order. I just need to know what it says on the tablet so I can verify what the pharmacy sent you. Sometimes when they run out of the A-G-V, they'll send the generic, so I just need to confirm that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm coming, honey. Hang on a minute. I guess I'm old. I've got to get my magnifying glass.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, trust me. I'm 41, and I can't see things, so I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says, it looks like C-C-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's what I needed to know. It's A-C, and then probably a number. You're correct. So the pharmacy sent me the A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to be clear, sir, because when you do receive this next order, it's going to be a replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's what I needed to know. It's A-C, and then probably a number. You're correct. So the pharmacy made an error, and they sent you the incorrect one, but not to worry. I'm going to send you out a replacement order of the A-G-V, and I'm going to up the dosage to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to be clear, sir, because when you do receive this next order, we have an exclusive account with Pfizer. We do carry the branded Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: As I'm sure you know, with any medication, when you get the brand, you're paying more for that. So we sell the blue branded Viagra, but they're $100 a tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what's great about the A-G-V is that it's made in the same lab by the same manufacturer, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, and from what I've heard from our customers, because I always ask them, they get the same results.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the A-G-V has been modified and improved. So over the years, Pfizer has made modifications to the A-G-V and how it works, particularly to the delivery mechanism. So they've eliminated all the side effects that people used to previously experience with Viagra. It's still going to be a line-shaped pill. It's going to be the A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me ask you this. You said that they're going to be $100 each?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no, no, no, no, no. I wanted to manage your expectations because you had mentioned you ordered the blue pill. We sell the blue pill, but it's not economical, let's say, right? No one wants to pay $100 per tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we have the A-G-V that works just as good as the branded. It's actually the same as the branded. So an authorized generic is the exact same drug as the name brand version. It's just sold without the brand name on it with permission from the brand company who makes it. So this A-G-V is made in the same lab as the branded one, and they've improved it to work just as well as the brand Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: This will still be a generic Viagra, but it's a new and improved generic Viagra. They've made modifications to how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason I'm asking, ma'am, and I know you're busy, but I don't need the side effects, and I had the old Viagra, and it worked really well, but I'd have a headache, my back would hurt.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they say that this new A-G-V is supposed to be better and not have all those side effects, and that's the reason I ordered it. And so I know you're sending me another prescription. I think I paid $68 for this, and it was the wrong stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm going to send you the A-G-V at no cost. You're not going to be billed since you already paid for it. I'm going to get this replacement order sent to you of the A-G-V, and you're going to love the A-G-V, especially because of the point you just made that the new A-G-V with the modifications I mentioned, they've eliminated those side effects. So when you take it, you're going to notice a huge improvement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am. Okay. Now, is this an automatic refill, or do I need to contact you every time to refill it? The reason I'm saying that is I just got hacked for over $500, and this card that I paid for it with, I just had to go get another one, and I haven't got my PayPal thing straightened back out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Answer one question first. Is this an automatic refill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, great question. So we're not a subscription like many other companies out there. We're FDA approved, so we're a telehealth. So the doctor wrote your prescription with refills, and so as our VIP customer, you can determine how you want to set up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So once you have an opportunity to try the new A-G-V, you can actually set up your refills however works best for you, and you can always modify and change that. So we have some customers that get their refills once a month, and we have some that get it every six months and everything in between. So you can also put a pause on your account at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd put what on my account, babe?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, you can also put a pause on your account at any time. So by circumstances of change, we can always put a hold on your account. That way you're not receiving them until you're ready to get your next order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's great, babe. Thank you, and thanks for answering all my questions. I hope I wasn't keeping you too long, but I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Donahoe, since I have you on the line and you brought it up, how did you want to set up your account going forward? I know you haven't tried the A-G-V yet, but do you want me to put a hold on it for three months so you have an opportunity to try it, and then you can call in and determine how you want to set up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Put it on there for two months. Can you do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can just call this customer service and change it anytime I would like?\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. Yes, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Well, let me ask you this. I pay through PayPal. Do I need to set up my new card with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, if you have a new card, I can update your billing information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, it's the same address, but my new PayPal card, like I said, I just got hacked and I had to go this morning and get it done, but my new account number is 4331-7744-4165-2932.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That's 4331-7744-4165-2932?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. And the expiration date is 1-29.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. And what is your security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 877.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir. I've gone ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. What happened?\n\nSpeaker 2: It sounded like you had too many numbers.\n\nSpeaker 1: It didn't either. You know what? It didn't update. Sir, I'm so sorry. Can you give that to me one more time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. I'm going to give it to you four at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 4331-7744-4165-2932.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so 4331-7744-4165-2932.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2932. Exactly right. And the expiration date and everything else is the same, babe.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you give it to me one more time? It didn't save it. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Its expiration date is 1-29 and the security code is 877.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I know sometimes people don't understand me because I'm just old country redneck, so not a lot of people don't understand what I say.\n\nSpeaker 2: But thank you for your help, darling.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure, sir. Thank you so much for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. You have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
