What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Robert Wilson, 8-1-51.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Robert. Okay, yeah, so I do see here that you did place an order three days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like your prescription hasn't been approved because the doctor does have a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: He asked, well, he said, I noticed you have a recent prescription for temosulicin.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you taking temosulicin?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because it looks like you have a recent prescription for it, so you're no longer taking it?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is it? What's the name of it again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Temosulicin, T-A-M-S-U-L-O.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, I'm not taking that. I'm never taking that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So I notified the doctor and hopefully once he sees you, he can go ahead and approve your prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're all set for right now, Robert.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're welcome. Bye.",
