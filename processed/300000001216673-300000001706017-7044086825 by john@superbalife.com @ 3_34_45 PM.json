    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, John. This is Jeremiah Yoder. I had ordered some Viagra AGB, and all I got was generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Phil Denisil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will help you out with this. We'll get this taken care of. Your zip code too, please, Jeremiah?\n\nSpeaker 2: 28110.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the pills with you, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: The what?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the pills with you, by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have them downstairs. Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to confirm one thing, but I do believe you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Because the sheet that it came with and the label on it show Phil Denisil, not Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you. The Viagra AGB is also going to have Phil Denisil, because that's in every version of Viagra, but it doesn't mean that you're wrong either. So that's why I just want to double check one thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hold on. I'm finding it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I've got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can you just take out a pill and tell me what you see stamped on the actual pill? That will confirm for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, gosh. Let me see. AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, yeah. You did get the wrong one. Your pill would have said 50 on it. It would also be a white diamond shape and all that stuff, but it would say 50 instead. And the label should have said AGB. So I'm just going to go ahead and get out a replacement order for you, sir. It's not going to cost you anything. We're just going to send out the right stuff. I'm going to message the pharmacy to take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do you have a tracking number? They'll give it to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: You will get that like you got it before.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do you see my prescription and address? Can you confirm it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Your prescription was right. The mistake was made in the filling of it. It was ordered for AGB. So I'm just going to get this corrected. And then we have 5904 SM Benton Lane.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. That's exactly where it'll go.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Can you expedite that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It won't go out till Monday, but yeah. I'll put priority on it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
