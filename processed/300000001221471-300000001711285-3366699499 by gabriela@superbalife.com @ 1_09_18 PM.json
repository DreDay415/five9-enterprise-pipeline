How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was cancelling my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mark Schaffner, S-H-O-F-F-N-E-R, date of birth 6-15-56.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what is the reason? Is it that you have enough supply? What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I used to take that same drug a long time ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I thought I was getting that new one, the A, B something.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they sent me this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what you order is the A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it says N-F-L-C-H-O, the active ingredient in it.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, this is a much more improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're able to know that it's the A-G-V because on the container it should say Greenstone\n\nSpeaker 2: since these are made in the Pfizer-Benz facility.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the pill should also have the number 100 engraved on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm just getting the rest of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you confirm, do you have the pills with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Say what now? Say that again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the pills with you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, when you get home, you can go ahead and check and take a look at the pills\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if they have the number 100 engraved on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they don't have the number 100 engraved on them, then give us a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good. I think it does have 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's sending now or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then it puts the active ingredient in the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it didn't do me any good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it could be that they probably sent you the classic one,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is why it's not working for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, whatever they're saying, they know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so let me go ahead and put you on a quick hold\n\nSpeaker 1: and verify with the pharmacy because if that's the case,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can go ahead and reship your order at no additional cost, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I was just trying one bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I realized yesterday I looked on PayPal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can they get ready to send me another bottle?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't like to get on a full prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I like to just try it out before I decide to get a full prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: and get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, it is a prescription, so that prescription, we do pay for it,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that prescription does come with refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I want, all the refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got one bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess I got another one on the way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you do not need it every month,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can always go ahead and just adjust it to your preference,\n\nSpeaker 1: or we can modify it to every two months or every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll just cancel all out, O-U-T.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just be aware that you're not going to be able to reorder with us\n\nSpeaker 1: in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been canceled one floor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
