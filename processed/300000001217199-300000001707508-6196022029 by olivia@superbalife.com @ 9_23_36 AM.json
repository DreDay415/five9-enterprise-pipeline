    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Libby speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Chris Cooper.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Chris. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Doing good. I'm trying to call to cancel any refills that are automatically set up for this account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this. Okay, Chris, what would the phone number for your account be if it wasn't this one that you called in on?\n\nSpeaker 2: What are you talking about?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what would the phone number for your prescription in your account be if it's not this phone number that you called in on?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have another phone number?\n\nSpeaker 1: 419-865-5700, but that doesn't work anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said 419-865?\n\nSpeaker 1: 5700.\n\nSpeaker 2: 5700. Thank you. There you are. Okay. And what's your date of birth, Chris?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-15-50-7.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Yeah, I do see your prescription here. Yeah, so you just received the pills, right? Did they work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. All right. Sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: There's nothing more than I can buy at my own drugstore with my doctor's prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay. Well, just so you know, you do qualify if they didn't work for you for a free sample of their newest, highest quality product.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you did want to try it, the free sample would be 10 pills, and it is a superior prescription to your current one.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are the fastest-acting, longest-lasting product we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way they work, like my favorite thing about them is they've been formulated to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: The free sample is 10 pills, and the way it would work is if I sent them to you, you'd probably get them by the end of the week,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you'd have until June to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, based off the data, and that you'd give us a call back in two to five months to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we might be able to keep you, and that would be worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, I mean, they're a great product if you want to try them.\n\nSpeaker 2: What are they? What are they made of?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, good question.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they come from our Pfizer labs in France directly, and they are our newest product.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're called their HEV, so yeah, they're a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're made of what?\n\nSpeaker 1: So they're still going to be, dildenafil is the active ingredient, just like every Viagra product ever made,\n\nSpeaker 2: and probably made until the end of time, but they are the newest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way you want to think about the formula is it's the closest that's ever been made to the branded Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: but even newer in the Pfizer labs.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I mentioned, they've been formulated to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'm willing to try that, but I want you to cancel the refill on this order you have now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, totally. Totally. That makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to send them to you at 100 milligrams, because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship these to 3985 Normal Street, Apartment 4?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So you'll receive these, like I mentioned, probably by the end of the week,\n\nSpeaker 2: but you know that winter storm is crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: So maybe Monday or Tuesday at the very latest, but I doubt it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually you would get them by Thursday or Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to send them to you at 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need anything before June, just give us a call and let us know,\n\nSpeaker 1: because the script is on hold until then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a reminder, you want to take the pills on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you want to avoid caffeine and alcohol the day you take the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, understood.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Well, I hope you love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, we're always around Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you need anything in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you've got the automatic refill stop, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, the other script is completely canceled anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: So with this new script, it's on hold for you until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you do like them, you'll probably run out by then and be ready to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if not, you know, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they're a great product, so I think you will love them.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
