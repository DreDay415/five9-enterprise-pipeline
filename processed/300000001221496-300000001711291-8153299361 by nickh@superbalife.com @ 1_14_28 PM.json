    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at ScoreBlue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I had been with you guys before and ordered ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm thinking I might want to try it again.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm looking for the best deal I can get.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, my full name is Rodney Fultz.\n\nSpeaker 1: F as in Frank, O-L-T-Z. Rodney.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I go by Rod.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's Rodney, my full name.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my birth date is 8-9-59.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And look it up and tell me what I got.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I got like 100 milligrams or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, in the past you did 100 milligrams Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that was at $98.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: $98.95 you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, here's what I can do for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, now, Rodney, since you're coming back to us here, I might be able to get you something a little bit better.\n\nSpeaker 2: And work better, too, you mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: And work better also because...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was thinking about getting you on the AGV if you were up to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's that mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV is the newest formula of Viagra from the Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, it has proven more effective, longer lasting, stays in your system for about 14 hours, and little to no side effects compared to its predecessors.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I like the sound of that so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Less side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I like the sound of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Keep going.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Rodney, what I can do for you here...\n\nSpeaker 1: So, in the past I know you were doing...\n\nSpeaker 2: You got 10 for $98.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could probably get you a little bit of a discount here, move you to the AGV and get you 10 pills for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me just adjust the script for you here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what's your name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Man, that's my son's name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, easy to remember.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a little down too, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you said $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like you said, it's better and it's a 14-hour thing because I don't need something that's going to last me 24 hours or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's going to be more potent for those 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I like that part.\n\nSpeaker 2: Rodney, could you confirm your shipping address for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ask you something real quick?\n\nSpeaker 2: I will confirm it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So say I can't take one a day, of course, because say if I wanted to be active and do it every single day, I couldn't take one a day, could I?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is safe for you to take 100 milligrams every 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you take one at 8 p.m. one day and you want to take it at 8 p.m. the next day, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's the same thing about the 24-hour period.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, here's my address, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: 2416 Belden Street.\n\nSpeaker 1: B as in boy, E-L, D as in dog, E-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Belden Street, Rockford, Illinois, 61101.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, Rodney, I have a credit card on file here ending in 1111.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the card you'd like to use?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't, if I got rid of that card, that card doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just give you this number.\n\nSpeaker 2: You ready for it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a Visa credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 4094-5106-9144-0553.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to read it back to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I have it here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 4094-5106-9144-0553.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: Expiration date is 9 of 26.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the three-digit security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 184.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll go ahead and put this through for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Fultz, you are all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can expect that in two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, happy to help any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when this works great, I'll order more from you, and that's a good price, and I like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's going to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbed.\n\nSpeaker 1: God.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbed.\n\nSpeaker 1: God.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how to do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.",
