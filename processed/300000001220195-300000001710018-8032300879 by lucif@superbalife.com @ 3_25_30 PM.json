    "text": "Speaker 1: Next call, Viagra, Quinn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Cameron Bergen. I just saw a charge on my credit card. I wasn't sure why.\n\nSpeaker 1: There was another charge on my credit card after they sent me a shipment. They sent me—\n\nSpeaker 2: Basically generic rather than supposed to be sending this new, the newer Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thing, and they gave you a choice of 100 or 200 or 150 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I understand. I know how it works. So that was one of your refills that went out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can choose when to get them. I'm not sure, you know, why that wasn't set up or why it's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't used them yet, so I don't know. I don't need refills until I call for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that's how you can set it up. I'm not sure why you didn't set it up—\n\nSpeaker 2: That way if that's how you wanted to order, sir. I didn't know that they were doing refills. I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Thought there was a trial. No, I'm talking about setting it up to order as needed. That's—\n\nSpeaker 2: How you should have set it up, to order as needed. Yeah, so let's just go ahead and say they just—\n\nSpeaker 1: Took the order now. Now it hasn't shipped yet, so let's go ahead and cancel it and I'll just call—\n\nSpeaker 2: When. They're supposed to be sending the new biography, but they didn't send that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That could have just been a mistake at the pharmacy. We can always just reship it to you,\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir. It's not a problem. I just thought you guys were just scamming and you said you were going to—\n\nSpeaker 1: Send the new version. Not a scam at all, sir. People make mistakes and we sell multiple—\n\nSpeaker 2: Medications. Not a scam. Okay, well, we just can't cancel it for now and sit there and we'll—\n\nSpeaker 1: Just, I'll get back to you if I want to get a refill. So do you or do you not want future orders—\n\nSpeaker 2: Because we can't just keep the prescription open if you're not going to order? Just keep the—\n\nSpeaker 1: Just stick with what the prescription says. It will say we're supposed to be getting the new—\n\nSpeaker 2: The new Viagra. That was the reason I contacted you guys. I wanted to try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so, I mean, we can reship it out to you, sir. It's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do they say on the thing that they sent?\n\nSpeaker 1: What? What does the order say that they sent? Do they send the—\n\nSpeaker 2: It says the AGV, but what did you receive?\n\nSpeaker 1: I received the standard generic. And it doesn't say AGV on the bottle at all?\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so we'll reship it to you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, again, let's, you know, I can send these back to you because these were the wrong—\n\nSpeaker 1: Things up there, and then you can—\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's fine. We're just going to reship it to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send me the right stuff, and if those cancel this order, and if it comes—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the right stuff there, then I'll consider refilling it when I use those.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. Thank you.",
