He said he was going to send me some pills, which might enhance it. I never received those yet. He said wait until after the holidays.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could take a look into the notes to see what's going on. What is your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 81240. 81240. And what's your last name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Gregor. R-E-G-E-R. And your first name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Philip Gills. Got it. One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Give me a moment. I'm going to put you on a brief hold and see what's going on with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Bye-bye. One second.",
