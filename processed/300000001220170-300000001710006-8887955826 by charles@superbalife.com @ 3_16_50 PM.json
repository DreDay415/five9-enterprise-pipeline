This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey Charles, I keep getting an order of this Viagra stuff from you guys and I didn't order it the first time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now I got another order of it and I want to return it and get my money back out of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, can I get your phone number please?\n\nSpeaker 1: 208-251-1858.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that's what popped up there. Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 832-55.\n\nSpeaker 2: And your date of birth please?\n\nSpeaker 1: June 13, 58.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Wayne Jarvis in Maury, Idaho.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep, Maury, Idaho.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and I'm assuming you're just way overstocked, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I never used it. I didn't use the first batch you sent me. I thought I'd try it, but I haven't.\n\nSpeaker 2: And now I got another batch here and I didn't order the first part of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Okay, whatever you don't want, there's a Southgate, Kentucky address on the pill bottle on the bottom right hand corner of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ship everything you don't want back to them and they'll issue a refund for everything you send them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you send it to Go Go Meds?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're buying and I send them both bottles back and they'll refund my money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you. And hey, cancel my order. I don't want any more of this shit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.",
