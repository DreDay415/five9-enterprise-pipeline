    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is Boonton. I would like to refill my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want an RF number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm going to pull up your profile by your phone number. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Boonton, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 2-11-1941.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. Okay, I see your profile. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and you want to do the Cialis again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, same.\n\nSpeaker 1: 20, 50, 20 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, because last time you ordered in May, you got Cialis, but before that in January?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, Cialis, I can't use it. It doesn't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem. So we'll get you out the AGV, which is the most recent version of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just works a lot better than the regular generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: And right now we have, you can do a quantity of 40 for $163.95, and then we have a quantity of 25 for $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Give me 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 60 tablet, because I'm in Thailand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can send it to my address in Irvine. No problem. My son can send it back to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. The largest quantity we can put in is 40.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last time I got 60, I had my bottle right here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can get 60 of the generic Viagra, but the AGV only comes up in quantities up to 40 because it's stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how much for the 40 tablets?\n\nSpeaker 1: 40 would be $163.95. Let me look up how much the generic quantity of 60 would be. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, here we go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, if you got 50 generic Viagra, 100 milligrams, it would be $263.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's like you're paying $100 for 10 more pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so let me take the original, not the generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 40 tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's stronger than the generic, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's better and less side effects, less headaches and less flush feeling. It's just better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never have anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's good. I hear so many. My eyeballs hurt, headaches, three days, three days. Oh, gosh, that's horrible.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, are we still using, I see we have an Amex on file ending in 3002?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure that one. You can try that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, that one went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so 40 tablets for how much is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 40 100 milligram tablets for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. They'll be shipping that out to you tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it should get to my house probably in a couple days?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you'll get it in about five to seven days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and then that does put you on automatic refills every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: But with your VIP status, you could pause it for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, every three months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so right now if you didn't pause it, it would automatically send you a refill on April 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: April 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why don't I do that? I do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I almost run out, I will call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so then I'm going to, yeah, so then what I'll do, I'll pause it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll pause it until July 31st. That way it keeps you longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, if I don't use it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call in any time before that for a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, before three months or whatever, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly. This way it just keeps your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it doesn't expire. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me use this first and then maybe in three months I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. Your name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle, okay. Thank you, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Bye.",
