How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, how are you doing, Nick?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's get this fixed for you. What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: The ad said Viagra, the new one, I think it's AGV. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we sell everything here. AGV is the newest formula that we have started to carry.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yes, we do sell AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went on the thing, it says free bottle, and the guy is showing a free bottle of Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: By the time we went into it, now they are going to give me generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure. Well, we sell everything here. Let's take a look at your account and get this resolved.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we need to cancel your initial order and get you the proper medication, we'll handle that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name or your name, Gladys?\n\nSpeaker 1: Larry Rose Lawrence.\n\nSpeaker 2: Lawrence Rose, Jr.\n\nSpeaker 1: It may just say Lawrence Rose.\n\nSpeaker 2: Date of birth is 11-3-48.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're right. So what I see here is what was selected online was the generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now we offer generic, we sell the AGV, we sell name brand Viagra, we also sell Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Common mistake, no worries, easy fix.\n\nSpeaker 2: My biggest thing here is that we don't offer a free bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is an FDA approved medication, so it's not free.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the AGV in particular is about $20 more than what you paid on the generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can either cancel this order and issue a refund altogether,\n\nSpeaker 2: or I can cancel it and then just charge you the difference for the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many do you get in the bottle?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the AGV comes in three different quantities.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did the 10 of the generic to do the same thing as the 10, so it's $63.95 out the door.\n\nSpeaker 2: You paid $43.95 for the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Change it to the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and cancel this one so they don't send you the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is everybody buying the new one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so all of our patients who previously took generic Viagra, they are moving over to the AGV now.\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV, yeah. It's authorized from Pfizer, so it's not like it's made in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not a generic that's made in Mexico or here in the States.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not like the first one where people are dying.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no. This is proven to have less side effects as well, so it is much safer.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know. I read it all. It was perfect. That's why I want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to request that medicine change now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, the difference will be $20, so you will see that reflected on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You have the credit card and everything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. It's the same one that you used the last time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it will be another $20. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have my address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I have it here as 16800 South Tamiami Trail.\n\nSpeaker 1: South Tamiami Trail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Tamiami. Apologies. Lot 194.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a problem with it, too. Sometimes I can't even spell it because I forget.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I went ahead and put that through for you, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we got that properly adjusted.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very, very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, happy to help. I'm sorry for any confusion.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have any questions in the future, just give us a call back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
