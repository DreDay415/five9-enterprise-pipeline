    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, my name is John Warren.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi John, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing all right. I ordered, spoke to the doctor, you guys advertised online and it's the new little blue pill from Viagra and you guys sent me generic Niagaras that I've had before, they weren't the shit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. Why am I not getting the stuff that I ordered?\n\nSpeaker 2: So John, I have no information about you, right? Okay. Let's start from the very beginning so that I can address your problem, so that I can even see it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: John, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-22-63.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at?\n\nSpeaker 2: 20008 Linus Cuevas Road, Sault Sierre, Mississippi, 39574. That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I do see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got generic Viagra, what is that? That is not what I ordered, that is not what I'm paying for. You all advertised on your, on the Facebook thing and all that, that it's the new improved and it's the new blue pill or whatever, however you all advertise it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's what I ordered and then I get a bottle of generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay, so I can definitely reship you out the AGV and make sure that is what you receive, obviously on us because you did already pay for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so you were at 50 milligrams. Can I ship this replacement to 20008 Linus Cuevas Road, Sault Sierre, Mississippi, 39574?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, so that will be done. Why would they send me generic? Why would they send me a generic form of something that's the old style pill? Because the new one is supposed to be new and approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right, yeah, it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: So why would they send me generic stuff that's definitely not the new and improved stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so from what I can see, that just wasn't your prescription number. Your prescription number just wasn't for the AGV, so I do apologize if there was any confusion about that, but I made sure that we sent you out the AGV, obviously at no cost to you because you already paid for the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's my only answer. It's just that's not the prescription number that I saw for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so when did I pay for this? How long ago?\n\nSpeaker 1: On January 10th.\n\nSpeaker 2: January 10th?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Seems like it was longer ago than that, but that's okay then. So how long is it going to take to get this order to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, to Mississippi, probably Tuesday or Wednesday. If that winter storm hits, maybe it'll take until Thursday or Friday, but usually, probably Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, I'm not even going to get pissy about this because it ain't worth my time today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: You would think they'd ship what you bought.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I made sure your prescription is changed over, so it's definitely the AGV. The way you're going to know is the pills themselves on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to say 50 for 50, and then the side of the bottle, it should say AGV and it should say Greenstone because that's the manufacturer for the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then as long as you take them on an empty stomach and without alcohol, you should have exceptional results. It is a far superior product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, or I plan on flying that. I was excited the shit was here. Now it's a generic Viagra, which isn't going to do nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Yeah, so you should receive it by next week, and you know where to find us if you need anything in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, have a great day.",
