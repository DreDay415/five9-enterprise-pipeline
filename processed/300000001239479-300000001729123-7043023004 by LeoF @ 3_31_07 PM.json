How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Felix Alexander.\n\nSpeaker 1: There was a prescription that was refilled automatically that I need to request.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm wondering how do I return this and get a refund?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you out with that, Mr. Alexander. Are you at 451 Newman Drive, Fayetteville?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Yeah, I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you didn't want to keep that order, you can send it back for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send instructions to your email on how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I always encourage people when this stuff does happen to hang on to them.\n\nSpeaker 1: They do have a two-year shelf life.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, of course, if you don't want them, you're not obligated to hang on to them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I'll send those over to your email now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then as far as that recurring refill thing, I can pause that for you if you just needed more time\n\nSpeaker 1: or if you wanted to think about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no. It depends.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you didn't want to get any more pills in the future?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. No problem. No problem. Give me just a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So, I just sent you over those return instructions.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you'll see those come by any second.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, Felix, I had to let you know you are a VIP with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we are the only FDA-approved vendors of this medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, if I do cancel, I won't be able to fill the prescription again for you in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: You would have to go to another company, get cheap pills from India, China,\n\nSpeaker 2: fentanyl laced, who knows what.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I just wanted to let you know that before I do finalize the cancellation for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand, but I just wish to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Alexander. So, I did take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set. I sent you the instructions.\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled the account. So, you're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll get that refund as soon as we get it back, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
