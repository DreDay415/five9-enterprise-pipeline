    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: John, Richard Reed here. How are you doing today, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing well. How can I help you out?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. I tried to call you a couple of times and finally got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Remember we talked some time ago about getting the Viagra AGB, and, you know, I wanted to probably pursue that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did all the other stuff I had. You said you could probably help me out here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I took that injection, all the other pills, and, you know, I don't want to be shooting myself for this other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I do remember that conversation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I sent you a bundle of money, and I was hoping you could help me out here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, as I understand it, I can take it immediately when I need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: In other words, I know it's going to take 10, 15 minutes, but I don't have to take it every day for months to get it to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's the best thing out there from what I've been able to research and what you mentioned to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm assuming I'm correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: And especially on the first point, you do not take it every day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Only if you're going to have sex do you take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you recommend just the Viagra, or you mentioned also you also have Cialis and the other stuff, Levitra.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't carry Levitra, but we do have Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because of how things are priced at the moment, I would suggest start with the Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's going to be better priced than the Cialis is at the moment,\n\nSpeaker 2: because we have that still on some sort of promotional pricing.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it isn't how you want it to work, you can switch to the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in terms of just trying to save you a few bucks,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would suggest at least jumping on the promotional price at your start.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and you said you were going to help me out because of what I went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, again, I know if you talk to hundreds of people, if you remember the conversation,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I think you said one bottle, and you may be able to help me out with a little something else there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's kind of where I said I'd do research on you, and I'll get back to you when I talk to you a week ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what would you recommend, what can you do so we can get something in a short period of time here?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, right, right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I remember talking to you, and I'm trying to remember exactly what I was referring to when I said that.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pricing, as right now, is 40 pills is $149, 25 is $99, or 10 would be $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I thought, and again, I got $30 in my mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know where that came from because, and, again, I'm sorry if I misinterpreted that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I don't know where I had $30 in my mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I had written down here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm saying, okay, let me see what's going on here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, again, 10 would obviously be, and I'd be hoping.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you write like $30?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it written as 30?\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe I told you I'd give you five extra pills or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but something, and, again, forgive me, I'll put down the 30,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm running the assumption it's going to be 30 bucks.\n\nSpeaker 1: And because we had a long conversation.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, again, it's hard for you to remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I was going to get it, but I tried everything else, including injections.\n\nSpeaker 2: Some things work, some don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some give you headaches, some, you know, I call it variables.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm saying, okay, let me get this going.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said he would help me out, and that's where I wrote 30 down,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I told you I would get back to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just assuming he was going to give me a good price, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: for more than 10 pills, you know, or 30 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what the scenario is, but you're very going to remember what we talked about.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, again, last thing, and, again, I know you pay for what you get.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm a senior citizen.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm over 70 years old on the PICS income, and I've been through all this other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And obviously if it's going to work, I'm going to get more.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I've got a potential client in mind here.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I don't do something quick, that's not going to stay around long.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's the reason I'm trying to get something going here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can get you set up.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in terms of the pricing, if we were to get you a lower price,\n\nSpeaker 2: there would have to be, contingent upon this working for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: but there would have to be an agreement of some sort where you're going to agree\n\nSpeaker 2: to receive it in X amount of intervals.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way I can lock you into a lower price, but it has to,\n\nSpeaker 2: because we're paying for the doctors and everything, at least starting out,\n\nSpeaker 1: we need an agreement that you would receive this in the future in a set interval.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't even have to be every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: It can be four or five months if you want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I could knock down the price somewhat if we can agree to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if it doesn't work at all for you, then obviously you can just cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: But rather than doing long-term orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, how would that work?\n\nSpeaker 2: What would you give me initially here?\n\nSpeaker 1: What pills were you looking to, like what amount were you looking to get?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you're suggesting the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would suggest at least starting with that on your, yes, I would suggest starting there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and how many pills can I get at what price?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then obviously that works for back in order, something down the road,\n\nSpeaker 2: a month or two down, out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again, this is the young woman that's over 20 years younger than me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can see the kind of situation it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I get you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're trying to make sure you live up to expectations and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the packages are what I said, 40, 25, or 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So depending on which one you want,\n\nSpeaker 2: I could probably find a way to get the price down a little bit for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, obviously, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: what I would like to do is at least start out with the 10, and it's just pricing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you give me that price and give me more pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say you gave me 15 for the 49 or whatever, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then just call the date to, like, see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: Again, some of this other stuff hasn't worked, all this other stuff I mentioned to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you're aggravating or hurtful, you know, for example, the injections.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't do that, and after the injection, there you go, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: then you hurt for an hour, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I definitely can, for the 49, I can definitely give you 15 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not a problem if you want to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just start small.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do that to start off, because that would at least give me an indication,\n\nSpeaker 2: then, like, if I need something at the future,\n\nSpeaker 1: without doing any other agreements or something, let's do this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'll go ahead and order it right now and get it going.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That totally makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have an e-mail address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can give that to you, or however you want to do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll order over the phone and give you a credit card, however you want to do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to sign up, I'm going to just take all –\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to do everything you would do online,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm just going to do it with you on the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the starting point is an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: My e-mail address, you still need that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, X as in X-ray, R as in Richard, B as in boy, R as in Richard,\n\nSpeaker 1: X as in X-ray at AOL.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just the five initials, X-R-B-R-X at AOL.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how did you spell your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: R-E-E-D.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I assume, Keith, this is the normal way to spell it,\n\nSpeaker 1: nothing different there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Richard, the same, you know, R-E-E-D.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-25-47.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 95120.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just got to load up the survey.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once I finish the survey with you, then I'll place the order for you\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll get you all set up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long have you been – basically, how long have you been having ED issues for, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, when I say again, and I'm not trying to be dismissive,\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't had sex in a long time, not been masturbating, stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can get it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Some of those stuff will give me an erection and, of course,\n\nSpeaker 2: sensitive to shots.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been able to have oral sex with her or me, and, you know, I can, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: I may have some venous leak, but, you know, but other than that, I can perform.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I know this will potentially work if it's what you said it's going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even some of the dialysis and stuff like that will give me a sensation,\n\nSpeaker 2: but won't necessarily maintain the heart because of timing, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's why I'm looking at this.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're saying it will happen in 10 minutes, where if you take, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: dialysis and, you know, you know what I'm trying to say.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, right, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it doesn't work in 25 minutes, then, you know, you've got to wait\n\nSpeaker 2: or you've got an empty stomach, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why this is something that would be advantageous because of the efficiency,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I think that's my problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I'm efficient, I think I'll be okay, and I don't have an ED problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Without it, I think I do have an ED problem if that makes sense to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, it does.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does.\n\nSpeaker 1: That helps.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, next question.\n\nSpeaker 1: When was the last time you had a physical?\n\nSpeaker 2: Less than a year, less than three years, between three and five or more than five?\n\nSpeaker 1: Less than two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I had my annual physical with a doctor, did all the blood work,\n\nSpeaker 1: examination, and all that good stuff, and I do it every year.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then your blood pressure, is that normal, elevated, high?\n\nSpeaker 2: Very high?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do take blood pressure, but my normal is about 138, 140, over 80.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to ask you about your medication in one question.\n\nSpeaker 1: This next one is a list of specific ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: So in the last three months, have you taken any of these following drugs?\n\nSpeaker 1: Diltiazem, erythromycin, erotoconazole, ketoconazole, ratonavir, verapamil,\n\nSpeaker 2: doxazosamethylate, crazozosanhydrochloride, parazosanhydrochloride, hormones,\n\nSpeaker 1: sedatives, ulcer medications, or clarithromycin?\n\nSpeaker 2: To my knowledge, what you said, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only thing I'm taking is just a high-pressure medication in cholesterol.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know the names of those specifically?\n\nSpeaker 2: They're generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can get them if you need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we will need the name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even if you're taking the generic, if you remember the name, brand name,\n\nSpeaker 2: they just need to know, like, what the medicine is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you hold on a second?\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll grab them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of them is resfarcin, which I guess is cholesterol.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: L-O-S-A-R-T-A-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the other one is simvastatin, S-I-M-V-A-S-T-A-T-I-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the last one is anodipine.\n\nSpeaker 2: A-N-L-O-D-I-P-I-N-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's related to D-E-S-Y-L-A-T-E.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's exactly what I needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Only a couple questions to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have any allergies that you know of, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not to my knowledge, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the past few months, have you passed out, had dizziness, seizures, or chest pains?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, this one's almost certainly no as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: In the last three months, have you used any of the following recreationally?\n\nSpeaker 1: Methamphetamine, marijuana, poppers, heroin, molly, or cocaine?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the last one is a list of different medical conditions.\n\nSpeaker 1: It seems like you're managing your blood pressure and cholesterol,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I don't know if you'll have any of these, but if you hear something, stop me.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't have any, just tell me at the end, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, vascular disease, emotional problems, hormone problems,\n\nSpeaker 2: kidney disease, neurological problems, trauma or injury to your penis, pelvis,\n\nSpeaker 1: perineum, testes, or rectum, prostate problems, urinary problems, sleep apnea,\n\nSpeaker 2: chronic fatigue or weakness, retinitis, pigmentosa, a significant bend in your penis,\n\nSpeaker 1: pain with an erection, problems ejaculating not related to hardness, cancer,\n\nSpeaker 2: radiation of the bladder, prostate, or rectum, unexplained weight loss, joint pain,\n\nSpeaker 1: sexually transmitted disease, heart disease, or urological surgeries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't stop you, but I did have prostate problems 15 years ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And no problems since.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we'll get you set.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I assume you want to do the highest dose, 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I would suggest.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm a big guy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm 240 pounds and 6 foot.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm assuming that's the highest.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I want this to work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, again, the timing, and I think this is why I'm so hopeful that this will be\n\nSpeaker 2: what it needs to be done.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's been hit and miss with this other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I think this will be what I need to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, highest dose.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we've gotten a lot of really good feedback on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I think it will do you well, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your address?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1536 Montevaux.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's spelled M-O-N-T-E-V-A-L Lane.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's San Jose, California.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 95120.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when you're ready, I'll take your card.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a MasterCard, and it's 5285-4600-4017-3305.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: 427.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 767.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your birthday was 10-25-47?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you recently move?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's having some ID check come up, which is one of usually three things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Either you recently moved, date of birth, or, sir, actually,\n\nSpeaker 2: are you like a senior or a junior?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Richard Reed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why it's triggering it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just was making sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe you say you are who you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've gone ahead and taken care of the order for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The receipt may say 10, but I'll make sure you get 15 like we discussed, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then let us know how it goes for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we'll mail it out shortly thereafter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So probably end of the week we get it roughly?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm assuming it's coming in the mail, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It does come in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: It usually is about five to seven days.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one thing I want to caution is, even though talking to me,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm also in California, our pharmacy is in Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm sure you've seen the news with all the storms.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are dealing with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It may delay a little bit,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it will be shipped out in a prompt manner as soon as they're able to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I appreciate you doing that for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: And hopefully this will take care of me.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll get back to you guys if it does.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, thank you for your time, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one, Richard.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
