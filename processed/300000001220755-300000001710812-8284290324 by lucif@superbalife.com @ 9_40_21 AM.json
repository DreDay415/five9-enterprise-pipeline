They had left me a number to call y'all to confirm that.\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife passed away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Let's pull you up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's pull up your account here. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I know we do not do any cancellations through e-mail or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got a confirmation saying it was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir. We don't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not how we legally do not process cancellations through e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: We need to verify that it is actually the patient.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that e-mail probably stated for you to call us if you'd like to talk about canceling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I understand. Sorry for your loss. We'll take care of it for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you sure this isn't anything you need down the line that we can just not ship it or bill it to you?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order this as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm not going to need it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. I wish I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries. No worries, sir. I understand. I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll take care of it for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Mr. Scott. You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.",
