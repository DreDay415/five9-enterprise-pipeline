Don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just reach out to us if you have any questions, and we'll help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, try it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: See how well you like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're a fan of it, then that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: If not, then just call us back, and we'll just go ahead and return.\n\nSpeaker 1: Also, I don't want to be on an automatic reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the way it works is every prescription is just through Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It needs to have a refill date to remain active.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't mean you need to get the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just means it needs to have a refill date to stay active.\n\nSpeaker 2: On yours, I see the doctor set it up for two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I'm going to do, so that way you have an opportunity to try this.\n\nSpeaker 2: And see if you want to keep it, I'm going to go ahead and set you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Out six months from now, which would be in July.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can go ahead and just call us after you try this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which I'm assuming you'll call sometime in March or maybe sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it'll just be a way for it to remain active if you decide to keep it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you don't lose access to the script.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it won't be shipped until it's specifically ordered?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. It won't be shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: It won't be shipped out every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's being delayed out six months from now, which gives you more than enough time to try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Experience it, and see if you're a fan of it or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That should work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it. So I know I've done a modification on your profile.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Other than that, you're all set to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: About how long is shipping?\n\nSpeaker 2: Typically, three to five business days to arrive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be looking forward to it.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye.",
