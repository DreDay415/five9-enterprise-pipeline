    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Jason Katelyn.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jason.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not great, but pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty good is good.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today, Jason?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the reason I'm not doing great is, I had, you guys shipped me some of the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I canceled it months ago, and y'all charged me for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why it came out of nowhere, out of the blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I can look into this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was hoping you could help me with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 07-03-74.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're located at 1017 King Arthur Lane, Louisville, Kentucky?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I had originally ordered it to try it out, and honestly, to me, it wasn't any different than the regular one.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called back and, you know, canceled my recurring order, which it was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I didn't receive it, and now it's like months later, and I received the package today,\n\nSpeaker 1: and, you know, I looked on my banking app, and, you know, I was charged for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, like I said, I canceled it, I mean, probably five or six months ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so I do see that you did have a conversation with somebody at the end of August,\n\nSpeaker 2: but that your prescription was placed on hold for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's been six months since then?\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I stopped it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't put it on hold, or I was unaware that it was on hold.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, yeah, I mean, that's why you received that refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the AGB working for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it works for me fine, but the reason I canceled it was, to be completely honest,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's not what you guys are advertising it as.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's basically no different than regular Viagra, you know, where you guys are advertising\n\nSpeaker 1: that it starts working in 15 minutes and lasts like 11 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's just like regular Viagra, which I can buy the regular Viagra for much cheaper\n\nSpeaker 1: at other places, so that's why I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyway, with that being said, the reason I was calling today is, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't order what I was shipped today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to see about getting a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I ship it back to you guys, or is there an option for that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I can email you the directions.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're pretty thorough.\n\nSpeaker 1: The email we have on file is jkaylin, like your last name, 120 at yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let me pull that up.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll send you that email in these next few minutes, and it'll be labeled\n\nSpeaker 1: return and refund instructions.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then once we receive the product back, we will happily refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, return and refund instructions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that the AGV, you didn't find it to be superior.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it is, in my opinion, and based on the reviews, it is a better pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a much newer pill with a much better and cleaner formula from\n\nSpeaker 1: our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I am sorry it didn't really work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not saying it wasn't good, but it just wasn't different than the regular\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra as far as the effects, where, you know, you guys claim that it stays in\n\nSpeaker 1: your system up to 11 hours and works almost immediately.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, I canceled your prescription, but in the future, if you\n\nSpeaker 1: ever want to find us, you know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, and secondly, thank you for your help, but I also want to make\n\nSpeaker 1: sure that it's not reoccurring.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you help me with that, making sure that it is canceled so, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't just get a random order again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, the prescription is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled your prescription, so you shouldn't receive anything in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so just out of curiosity, let me make sure I got this right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So whoever I spoke to, because I look back on my bills and I wasn't, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: charged each month.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was just this month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they just, instead of totally canceling it, just canceled it for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what happened?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so in order to keep the prescription active and available to you, you do\n\nSpeaker 2: have to have at least one refill saved every six months, just because otherwise\n\nSpeaker 1: six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you did need to push it back or if you needed it earlier, you could\n\nSpeaker 1: always do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I guess whatever was decided on the phone, he thought that you were\n\nSpeaker 1: paying your refill on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so, you know, maybe in our conversation, I said it had been six months\n\nSpeaker 1: ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, maybe, you know, he said that and was like, hey, you need to call us\n\nSpeaker 1: back before six months if you do what I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I don't remember exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, I'm not, like, pointing my fingers at anybody.\n\nSpeaker 2: But at any rate, I was just trying to find out what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you have a great evening, and thank you much for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll just go to my email, and the email will kind of walk me through it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it like a packing slip or something, you know, for the return?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so you just take it to USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: The instructions are really thorough, and everything you should need is in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's simple enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get back to you for the email here in a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, again, thank you very much for your help, and you have a good night.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Jason.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
