Is there any side effects with that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing negative, it's a completely all-natural supplement, nothing negative should come about it whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you know what, let's give it a try, maybe something else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I always say maybe we just need to pivot a little bit and get something a little bit to increase the blood flow\n\nSpeaker 1: down to that area, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll set that up today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do me a favor, be consistent with taking it in the morning or at night, whatever you prefer, once a day,\n\nSpeaker 2: for about like a week and a half, okay? It should take its effect with the blood flow\n\nSpeaker 1: if you are consistent with it for about a week and a half, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, how many pills are you sending me?\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes with 60, it comes with 60. It's really a great product for this, it's really a great product,\n\nSpeaker 2: so continue to take it if you want, it really does increase blood flow throughout the body,\n\nSpeaker 1: heals like lactic acid, basically, if you have a sore or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, so you're saying take it once a day or take one in the morning?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just one in the morning with your breakfast or your coffee, whatever does it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just make sure you take at least one a day, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that'll be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd expect it, it's kind of hard to determine how soon you'll get the pills\n\nSpeaker 1: because of the weather pending somewhere around your area.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just need to advise you on that, I'd expect it maybe Tuesday or Wednesday next week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, sounds good. Okay, Paul, great talking to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great rest of your day, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I need to warm up this weather up here, it's too cold.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I bet, I bet, you got to come down to LA once it starts getting like that over here, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, gee, no kidding.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too, brother.",
