Just regular?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, you think I'll get it in two weeks?\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll get it within the next five business days, yeah, for sure, but if you needed it earlier we could have done that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, I don't need it in two weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to run out before I go on vacation, but I will be running out then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hear ya, I hear ya, okay James.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, sounds good, everything went through, I hope you have a great rest of your day, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, and I appreciate your business.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, James.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, you too.",
