    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello? Hello. Hi. Hi, who am I speaking with? This is Joanna. Hi Joanna, how you doing? I think I\n\nSpeaker 2: talked to you last week. My name is James Leach. Yeah, let me pull up your account\n\nSpeaker 1: one moment. Okay, Mr. Leach, yeah I have your account here. So when we spoke last\n\nSpeaker 2: week, you were going to call me back to let me know if you were able to cancel an\n\nSpeaker 1: order that was coming out from the pharmacy, which apparently arrived here,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we're going to send that back to get the credit because it's not the right\n\nSpeaker 1: one, and then you were supposed to send me out the correct one, but I haven't\n\nSpeaker 2: received anything. I haven't received any type of tracking. I haven't received\n\nSpeaker 1: anything. Okay, let me assist you. So one second, because I did send you out that\n\nSpeaker 2: replacement order. Okay, so the replacement order which I sent you says\n\nSpeaker 1: it was delivered January 22nd at 12 o 9 p.m. Did you not receive it January\n\nSpeaker 2: 22nd? I did receive one order, but I didn't even open it because I know you\n\nSpeaker 1: said there was one that was on its way already, which you said was the incorrect one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, and I remember I messaged the pharmacy and told them not to send it, so\n\nSpeaker 1: if you received that one, it means that... Again, I got one, so I don't know which one I got\n\nSpeaker 2: because I was just going to return it. I know you said to return it, but which I\n\nSpeaker 1: did not yet. I still have it here. I just didn't open it yet. Okay, let me check on\n\nSpeaker 2: this other one. But I also didn't... I know you said if it was canceled that I would\n\nSpeaker 1: have got a credit, but I didn't see the credit yet either. Okay. Okay, to me it\n\nSpeaker 2: looks like the one that we canceled didn't ship out, so I'm going to issue a\n\nSpeaker 1: refund for that one. Okay. And then, so the one that you received there, that's\n\nSpeaker 2: that's likely the one that I sent you at no cost, which was the replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want to open that up and look at the tablet, it should say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I didn't want to open it until we were sure because... Of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second. So yeah, the one I have, this one says 100 on it. Okay, that's the correct\n\nSpeaker 2: one. That's the replacement. That is the AGV there. So you did get that one. And the one\n\nSpeaker 1: that I messaged the pharmacy did not ship. They ended up not sending out to you. That's\n\nSpeaker 2: why you haven't received it. And I've gone ahead and I just issued a refund for that\n\nSpeaker 1: now. So you'll see it on your end in a couple of days. And you think this one will not cause\n\nSpeaker 2: the issues with the headaches and stuff like that? A hundred percent. That's one of the\n\nSpeaker 1: best things about the AGV, is that they've eliminated the common side effects with this\n\nSpeaker 2: site. And also just overall works better. So give it a try. Remember to take it on an\n\nSpeaker 1: empty stomach, no alcohol, and that way you get the optimum result. Okay. All right,\n\nSpeaker 2: sir. You're all set. Thank you for calling in. Thank you.",
