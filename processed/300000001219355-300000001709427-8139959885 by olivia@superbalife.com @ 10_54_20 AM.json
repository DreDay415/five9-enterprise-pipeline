    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Olivia, my name is Larry Knudson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Larry, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, excuse me, got a little frog in my throat here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I received some of your product and it didn't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I didn't know how to automatically order it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: So can I get that taken off my credit card?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can definitely look into your prescription for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And see what we can do, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the phone number associated with your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: It'd be 813, I don't know if I give you the—\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, 813-995-9885.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this one didn't work, so is there another one you have?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 813-892-6307.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6307, there you are Larry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 5-18-51.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll just update that, 19-51.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you're located at 21-209 Cali Rosa Drive,\n\nSpeaker 2: in Grand Lakes, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so I do see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that refill has unfortunately already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do have a lot of options so I'll start at the easiest one\n\nSpeaker 2: which is because it's shipped but you haven't received it,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's good because that means you have not opened it.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as you do not open the package,\n\nSpeaker 1: once you receive it and you see a score blue package,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: leave it in your mailbox and your post person\n\nSpeaker 2: will bring it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then once we receive it, we can process your refund\n\nSpeaker 2: or even three or four days later if you want,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can call us back and say, hey I did return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 2: can you pull that tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can either do that over the phone\n\nSpeaker 2: or it is easier to do it over email\n\nSpeaker 1: just because the email team's a little quicker to respond\n\nSpeaker 2: and then they can get you your refund immediately.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yeah, if you don't want to receive regular refills\n\nSpeaker 2: with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: on hold for up to six months at a time\n\nSpeaker 1: just because six months is when the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work\n\nSpeaker 2: is if you did want to place it on hold\n\nSpeaker 1: and you did want to order before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself\n\nSpeaker 1: before the end of July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now let me, excuse me, is there a way I can just cancel it\n\nSpeaker 1: now after I send it back and you give me a credit?\n\nSpeaker 2: So no matter what, you would get a refund\n\nSpeaker 1: if you send the product back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So do the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I tried two of them and it didn't work for me, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, okay, well then, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well it is my job to let you know\n\nSpeaker 1: that obviously if this prescription doesn't work for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: then it makes sense that you certainly don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do qualify if the pills don't work for you\n\nSpeaker 2: for a free sample of our newest, highest quality product,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is a superior prescription to your current one.\n\nSpeaker 2: The free sample would be 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it would be 10 pills of our newest, fastest acting,\n\nSpeaker 2: longest lasting stuff from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my favorite thing about them\n\nSpeaker 2: is that we specifically formulated them\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut out the side effects\n\nSpeaker 2: of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they come with a five month kind of like a free trial,\n\nSpeaker 2: where the way you wanna think about it is\n\nSpeaker 1: obviously your old script is canceled,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the new one would be started with the 10 pills\n\nSpeaker 1: that are a free sample,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then the prescription would be placed on hold for you\n\nSpeaker 1: until June while you try them out,\n\nSpeaker 2: and make sure you love them,\n\nSpeaker 1: make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe you would,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we believe that you'd give us a call\n\nSpeaker 2: in two to five months to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we might be able to keep you,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'd have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: The new pills, are they Cialis or something, or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they are our newest Viagra from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, or 25 or 100,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you were approved for 50,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that's probably what I'd send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I think I appreciate the offer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I'd like to just discontinue the thing entirely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so either way,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can cancel this script.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just, you don't wanna try the free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, you know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are the only sellers of that product in the world,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we paid a few million dollars to be able to say that\n\nSpeaker 1: with through Pfizer to be the direct seller.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we'd love to have you back at some point\n\nSpeaker 1: to purchase that product.\n\nSpeaker 2: We just wouldn't be able to offer you a free sample\n\nSpeaker 1: because we no longer have a prescription to attach it to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we're always here, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and just, now, if I return the box unopened,\n\nSpeaker 2: they'll just automatically credit my account too?\n\nSpeaker 1: Once we receive it back, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you receive it, yeah, that's what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm sorry, what was your name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I thank you for all the information.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you had a good sales pitch there,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'm just not going for it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no free sample of the AGV, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Larry, I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Olivia, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
