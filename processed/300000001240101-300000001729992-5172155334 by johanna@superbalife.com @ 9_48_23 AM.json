    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Joanna speaking.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I had prescribed to get something from you guys a while back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't know, it must be you do automatic send out or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it depends.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can set up your account however you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me access your account so I can better assist you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: James Parker, P-A-R-K-E-R, 9-14-57.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks, Mr. Parker.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have your account pulled up.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it looks like currently you're set up to receive refills every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, as a VIP status customer, of course, you can modify the quantity and frequency of your orders at any time or put a pause on your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you are getting 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can always reduce that to 25 or 10, which, of course, would lower the cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can delay your order or space out the frequency or put a pause on your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you can retain your VIP pricing and still have access to your prescription because otherwise canceling it would cancel any available future refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess if it's every three months, that's probably good.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to reduce the quantity, perhaps?\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd be getting 40 every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you ever say that there's one month where you don't need it quite yet, you can call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the difference in cost between, like, 40 and 25?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 40 of them you're getting for $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: 25 would be $113.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought probably 25 would be good for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So update your future order to 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then did you want me to keep it on a three-month reoccurring?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've gone ahead and updated that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, if you ever want to modify that or delay an order or say you want to order more before your next refill date, just give us a call and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you for being a VIP status questioner.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm glad I was able to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've done just what I needed to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually it seems like it's always more problems than this.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like, man, I got through to you guys right away and boom, boom, boom.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it was perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Mr. Parker.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a super day, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
