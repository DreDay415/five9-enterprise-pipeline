    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi there, it's Anthony DeRussy.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much for asking me.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you, Anthony?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd just like to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know it was one of these where you buy one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely...\n\nSpeaker 2: They keep sending them to you every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've never checked any boxes that said that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, every site has its scams.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not saying you guys are scamming me, but, you know, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who knows?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what's your...\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your date of birth, Anthony?\n\nSpeaker 2: October 7, 1953.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 1350 Westwood Avenue, Unit 501, Richmond, Virginia?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just changed that, and that was the other problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know you guys were sending me a second order, and it came up on my Capital One bill,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you didn't send me a notice that you were doing that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I couldn't change my address because I was in the process of moving,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so now it's going to go to an empty house.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so sorry about that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe the squirrels will eat it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, but we'll have a good time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: you certainly don't have to receive regular refills if you do not want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you did want to order before,\n\nSpeaker 2: then you could.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself before the end of July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, yeah, so if you need anything before July 23rd, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here this number, Monday through Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be canceled on July 23rd?\n\nSpeaker 2: So you just need to let us know by July 23rd either if you want to order\n\nSpeaker 1: or if you still have pills and you need the prescription placed on hold again\n\nSpeaker 2: for any duration of time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can't we just cancel it now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can't we just do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm old.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll never remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: By July 23rd, you're going to be sending me orders again,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to have to call you again, and it's going to be a pain.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not very good, to be honest with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's been advertised as some cheap version of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, no, I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, the last part of my job is just to let you know, Anthony,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if you're interested, great, and if not, no worries,\n\nSpeaker 1: is if the pills aren't working for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: then obviously it makes sense that you don't need this prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you do qualify for a free sample of our newest highest quality product,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is a superior prescription certainly to what you have been receiving,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the free sample, the way that would work is it's 10 pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you would receive it if you were interested by next Tuesday or Wednesday,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you would have a six-month kind of like free trial almost is the way\n\nSpeaker 2: you want to think about it, because what it would be is a new prescription\n\nSpeaker 1: that is started by the free sample that is placed on hold for you until July\n\nSpeaker 2: to try out, make sure you love it, make sure you prefer it to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe you would, and based off of the reviews of the product,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is the fastest-acting, longest-lasting product we've ever made,\n\nSpeaker 1: but my favorite thing about it is that we have specifically formulated it\n\nSpeaker 2: with Pfizer in France to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you did like it, our reviews show within the next two to six months\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd run out and you'd give us a call to order some,\n\nSpeaker 1: then we might be able to keep you, and if not, you just need to let us know\n\nSpeaker 2: by July that you would have 10 free pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let's try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think the stuff you sent me was, I'll be honest with you,\n\nSpeaker 1: the dosage was like 50 milligrams or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's insane.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm not taking that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I have other stuff that I take five milligrams of,\n\nSpeaker 2: like the Synthadel, Synthadel, whatever it is, but not Synthadel,\n\nSpeaker 1: the Tadasyl, the Tadasyl.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take five milligrams of that and it works fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, come on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know what's in the stuff you sent me.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's garbage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let me try the free stuff and then we'll see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what is your correct address so I can make sure we get it to the right place?\n\nSpeaker 1: I corrected it online, 1315.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I wasn't sure if I was going to continue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was hoping maybe you had something else that you could say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, we do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I went to college in VCU.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's a nice little school.\n\nSpeaker 1: When did you graduate?\n\nSpeaker 2: I love Richmond.\n\nSpeaker 1: I love Richmond.\n\nSpeaker 2: 2013, so it's been quite some time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where are you now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we are located in Santa Monica.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's nice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's quite the distance away.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the free sample, you do want to stick with 50 milligrams, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not really.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I think the dosage is way too high.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do you want to do 25 then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so let's cut it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you say this stuff is the new whiz-bang stuff and it's got less side effects,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I don't want to take 50 and have side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's no fun.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's fun for a bit, and then it's no fun at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: With headaches and whatnot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and I can ship it to 1350 Westwood Avenue, Unit 501, Richmond, Virginia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, are you going to charge me for the shipping?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's also free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, so I'll place that right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it should be out to you by next Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, if you need anything before July, just give us a call and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I hope you love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you've canceled the other thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Anthony.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
