I was expecting a delivery of my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if it's on its way or if something got dropped off.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I can get your name and zip code, I can check.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Richard Barbarita, B-A-R-B-A-R-I-T-A.\n\nSpeaker 2: Zip code is 15234.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Willow Street in Pittsburgh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it goes to the mailboxer.\n\nSpeaker 1: It actually says it was delivered to your mailbox this morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: This morning?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it says it was delivered at the mailbox at 10:46 a.m. local time to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I just checked my mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have an apartment address?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have 4020 Willow Street, Apartment 636.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. 15234.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, I'll check again. I was just there like an hour ago and I didn't see it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm going to send you the tracking link, too, so you can see what I'm looking at.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have your email here and your first name, last name at Gmail, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. With a dot in between.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Gotcha. Yeah, I'll make sure that's in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I missed reading it too quick, but, yes, I see it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll go ahead and send that to you just so you have an idea of what I was looking at, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, sir. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
