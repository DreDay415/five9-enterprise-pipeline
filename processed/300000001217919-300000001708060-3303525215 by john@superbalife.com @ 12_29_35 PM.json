    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling, this is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I'm calling about an order that I had placed earlier today, and for some reason you have the wrong email address that you're sending information to, actually to my son.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your name and zip code, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Paul Ferder and my zip code is 44240.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see the issue. So the problem is, I can fix it and change it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you had started an account previously and then you started a second account with a different email because it won't let you start two accounts with the same email, but you probably didn't know how to log back in. So is the PJCF749wanted@gmail the one you want it to go to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the Gmail account is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where it's—well, I'll tell you, let me give you another one. It's PJ at Kentmold, k-e-n-t-m-o-l-d dot com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, like P as in Paul, J at Kentmold dot com?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'll change your email over to that, that's no problem, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that all? Is that all you need to help with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Was just making sure that's changed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I wanted to get that changed because somehow you've got—you're sending it to Paul at Kentmold and that's my son's address.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you. It's been removed now, so nothing else will go there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, you too. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.",
