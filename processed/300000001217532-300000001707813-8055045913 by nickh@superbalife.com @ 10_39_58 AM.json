    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you so much for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd like to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. I can help you with this. Could you please provide me with your full name and date of birth under the prescription?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, James Velocien.\n\nSpeaker 1: V-a-l-o-v-c-i-n?\n\nSpeaker 2: Date of birth 3-17-1958.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, James. So I'm looking at your prescription here. This is for the 50 milligram generic Viagra, quantity of 30. Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it looks here that the most recent order went through on the 25th.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does appear that that one has not yet been shipped. Would you like me to put a cancellation request in there for that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Okay. Let me reach out to the pharmacy, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I went ahead and put that request in to cancel the most recent order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once they're confirmed with me that that's canceled, I'll go ahead and issue a refund of the 103.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, regarding the prescription as a whole, you do have VIP status with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's because you've been a patient since—\n\nSpeaker 1: 2023. What that means is your account is perfectly adjustable. This is not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to get this bi-monthly how you have been. If you wanted, you could simply pause it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then that would allow you to call in and place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, then let's do that because I've got, you know, like three vials, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the older I get, them slowing down. I tell you, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes. Now, food for thought in the future, you know, I know you've been taking the same thing for some time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you like it, that's completely understandable.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we do offer you new Viagra AGV. A lot of patients are moving over to that from the pills that you are currently taking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Proving a little bit more effective, longer lasting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, cost effectiveness. I mean, it's about the same price. It's a little bit more money.\n\nSpeaker 1: But also that's for a hundred milligrams instead of 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you ever want to place an order in the future, feel free to inquire.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, we might even be able to send you a sample if you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's good to know. Yeah, so for now, let's just put it on pause and then when I—\n\nSpeaker 1: Go through the back order that I have, I'll give you a call back and reinstate.\n\nSpeaker 2: Consider the new option.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. All right. So like I said, yeah, once that's confirmed that that's been canceled, you'll be issued that refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, anything else I can do for you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's it. You've been very helpful.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your responsiveness and thank you for your assistance.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, happy to help anytime.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good rest of your day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You as well. Take care. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
