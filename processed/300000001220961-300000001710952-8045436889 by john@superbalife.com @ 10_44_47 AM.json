    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, um, I did a prescription for you guys and I didn't get what I thought I was gonna get.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll have an order number if you need it. Let me fix this for you. Actually, your name and zip code helps you more though.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Patrick. My last name is DeServio, it's d-i-s-e-r-v like victor i-o.\n\nSpeaker 1: My zip code is 23103.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, you have the pills with you right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can go get them. Okay. I just, I would just like to ask you to read to me what's on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe you but I just need to confirm.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's so down a film no, I asked what's on the pill not on the bottle because the agv is also so beneficial.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I, I did look at it taught me what it was here as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Um, I think I took a picture of it. Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: I, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have here that you did order agv.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if there's a mistake, I just need to confirm and then fix it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it says ac339.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, that that is indeed wrong. Yours would say 50 if it was right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, um, I assume there's no issues with the address, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: It should be blue I would thought because it's coming from viagra, right? It's not coming from, it's not supposed to be generic, is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Agv stands for authorized generic. It means that Pfizer themselves is making this generic version. The blue is their窶能n\nSpeaker 2: Trademark for the name brand that automatically makes it a hundred dollars for pill. So in terms of quality窶能n\nSpeaker 1: It's the same if not better than the blue pill. It's just white, but you did get the wrong one regardless.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I can get these at my窶能n\nSpeaker 1: CVS for two dollars.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm sending you out 20 of the right ones. Those ones, if you want to keep them as a backup plan you can, but窶能n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to return them to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you're going to send me out the abgs?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. Uh, like I said, it is going to be white, but these will be the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll say 50 on it, they'll work more effectively. There's no cost to you. We're just fixing a mistake we made.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'm sorry about that, but I'm getting this taken care of right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thanks. All right. Thanks, Patrick. Bye.",
