How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was calling about your Viagra AGV or AGV Viagra or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we are the only company that's contracted directly with Pfizer with their manufacturer, France,\n\nSpeaker 1: called Greenstone, to supply the FDA-approved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And right now we have a deal of the month.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get a quantity of 40 for $149, and then we have a quantity of 25 for $99.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they come in 25, 50, and 100 milligrams, and it's all the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: You might as well get the hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. How long does it take to get it?\n\nSpeaker 1: So once you place your order, I just have to ask you some questions for the doctor to review,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then it goes to our doctor, and he just needs to approve your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once he approves it, it goes to our pharmacy, and they ship it out to you from there,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you'll get it in about seven days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so from the time I place the order, it's, what, 10 days, 12 days?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no. Yeah, so it ships from Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll get it in about seven days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and that's from the time of placing the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and the pharmacy emails you a tracking number as soon as they ship it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty. Well, that's all the information I need right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would place the order right now, but I'm driving, so as soon as I stop driving, I'll place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries. Sounds good. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
