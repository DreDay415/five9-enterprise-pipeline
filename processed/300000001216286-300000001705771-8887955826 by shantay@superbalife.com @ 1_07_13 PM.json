    "text": "Speaker 1: Good afternoon, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you? Yes, I ordered some pills for Viagra AVG, and I got a generic brand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me help you with this. Can I have the telephone number that's on your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe it's 607-437-5508.\n\nSpeaker 2: For Thomas, is it V-take or V-take?\n\nSpeaker 1: Vitale.\n\nSpeaker 2: Vitale. Oh, okay, wait, hold on. I don't think this is the correct profile.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you maybe use a different number? Because the number you gave me, it did pull up an account, but it's an incomplete order. Incomplete account, I should say. Did you maybe use a different number?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try 607-214-4292.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 12093.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I found it, yeah. So this profile, we have 607-214-4292, and your last name is spelled correctly on this one. It's Vitale, V-I-T-A-L-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, now do you have the pill bottle in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, can you read the side identification? If it's going to have the word identification, you can find it on the right of the label towards the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that a phone?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not that. Turn the bottle towards the right or maybe turn it towards the left. It's on the right side of the label.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, hold on a second while I get my glasses on. It's a small print.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is getting old.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, the verified number?\n\nSpeaker 2: The identification, if you can read me the description.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says identification.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says AC339.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, so that is the incorrect Viagra. I do apologize, that was sent to you. I am going to notify our pharmacy and they'll send you a free replacement order to replace the 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to get the right one, the Viagra AGB, whatever?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Viagra AGB, that's correct. So you'll get that the next day. Once you receive it, you can dispose of them and no need to return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye-bye.",
