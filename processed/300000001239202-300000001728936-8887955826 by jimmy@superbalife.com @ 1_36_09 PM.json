    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is about the third person I've spoken to.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered an order of these like, I don't know, five weeks ago, something like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're crap. They're a scam. And then I get another order of them today.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not order multiple orders of this. I wanted to stop.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me get your phone number so I can pull up your account and see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it looks like you were transferred over.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. So you need my number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please. Your phone number that you're connected to.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 314-574-0330.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Let me see what's going on there. Is this Dennis that I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Dennis. All right. So I do have you up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you were getting a bag of 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you were getting 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like your prescription had you to get 10 every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do this.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I got you. I heard you say it. I'm just telling you what I'm looking at.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I do see, I see an order just was sent out to you, and they charge you for the 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to take care of that for you right now. I'm going to get that reversed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. First of all, let me go ahead and do that for you to make you right on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Give me one second to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Before you hang up, Dennis, you're going to be happy with that call. Trust me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give me a second as I take care of the first thing I'm talking about doing for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. No problem at all, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, the first thing you mentioned is you thought it was a scam, and that's the last thing we are.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to prove that to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: By the time you hang up, you're going to be more than happy with what we're dealing with.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So as of right now, I just went ahead and I refunded you that last order that you just received for that 63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: See, so it's going pretty smooth so far, right, what we're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, what I do also see, Dennis, I noticed that when you placed your original order, you must have did it online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct, when you placed your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you go online?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to tell you something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that also correct, when you did the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have no idea, really.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because you did.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just got the regular Geneg Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I want to do for you for absolutely free, I want to send you 10 of the replacers, what I think you should have gotten in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I went ahead and gave you your 63.95 back for that other order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just removed this other prescription that you had out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I stopped those monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: I stopped those monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I also stopped the monthly charges that was occurring with your other prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, what I want to do absolutely for free, I'm going to send you out 10 of what I think you should have got, which was the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to send you 10 of them to replace those first 10 that you got that you said didn't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I guarantee you, once you try these, you're going to want to order some more of these in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I'm going to tell you is when you do want to order, don't go online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just do what you're doing now and give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I'm not going to have you on a monthly prescription like these was before.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to allow you to order when you want to as far as that's concerned.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to pause all future subscriptions off that you're not getting.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to change it to what I'm going to send you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me tell you what I'm going to send you for free now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be a white-shaped diamond Viagra pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the new and improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you try that one, I guarantee you're going to absolutely love it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're going to want 10 more as soon as you get through with those.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how does that sound so far, Dennis?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But going forward, then I don't owe any money, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, not at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you 10 for free, and I'm going to change the subscription to be what I'm sending you next.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you do order, don't go online.\n\nSpeaker 2: Listen to me very clearly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call us like you're calling now to place another order of the ones you're going to enjoy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you've been of great help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can call and ask for me, Dennis, when you want to order again.\n\nSpeaker 2: And remember, like I said, the pills are going to look very similar,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the ones I'm sending you are going to have that number 100 on the back,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're going to see a drastic difference on how these work compared to what you got at first.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Jimmy, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should see the credit on your card within a couple of days, too, for that order you just received.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.",
