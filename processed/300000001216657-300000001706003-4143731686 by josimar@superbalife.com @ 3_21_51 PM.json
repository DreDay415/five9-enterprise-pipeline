I can take a look into your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't have your...\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hardeman.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't say anything, you just said your last name after your zip code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Five, three, Troy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it. One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is based off your first order you made with us, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you get an opportunity to read the terms and conditions after placing your first order?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: The zip doesn't... No, that was... No, that wasn't supposed to happen, so either return it or...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I was just asking you because, like, I just asked you a question if you were able to read something,\n\nSpeaker 1: but if you didn't read it, it's fine. I was just asking you that.\n\nSpeaker 2: But basically on that terms and condition, it just states that every order is a prescription-based order,\n\nSpeaker 1: meaning that they need a refill date to be activated and sent out.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor set up every month for you because you got 10 pills, but it looks like it's still at the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I could just cancel it out and issue a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in mind your prescription itself, though, if I were to cancel that,\n\nSpeaker 1: you wouldn't be able to access it anymore because the doctor would delete the visit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Instead, I could always just freeze it out if you want that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had already told them it don't work, so I didn't want...\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries. So no problem, then. I'll just cancel it out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set. Have a good one. You'll get the refund back in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get the refund back in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Bye-bye.",
