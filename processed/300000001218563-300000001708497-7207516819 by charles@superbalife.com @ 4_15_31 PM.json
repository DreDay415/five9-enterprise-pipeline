I've had it for the past two or three years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Boone, Wanaklung?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, Wanalong, yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wanalong, gotcha. Sorry about that. And Strasburg, Colorado?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do you just need to pump the brakes for a while? I know you've been getting them for quite some time. I can pause everything from now until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good. I'll set that up right now for you. So July 27th, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need them earlier, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, give me a break for a little bit, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Like I said, if you need them earlier, give us a call. We'll be here, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. But July will be my next payment, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. That's cool. That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, then. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Bye-bye.",
