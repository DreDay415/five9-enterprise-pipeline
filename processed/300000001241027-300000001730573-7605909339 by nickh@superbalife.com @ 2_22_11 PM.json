    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'd like to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: Easy enough. Yes, sir. I'm happy to help you with that. Could you provide me with your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Otis Weathersby.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2463?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Otis, bear with me while I look up your chart, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I—\n\nSpeaker 2: See, your prescription here was written back in—\n\nSpeaker 1: March of 2025, and that was for the 50 milligram Viagra, then eventually moved to the 100 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've been on that ever since. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I thought I was getting the AGV, but—\n\nSpeaker 2: They kept sending me the other ones because the other ones don't work. I was looking for the AGV to try that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you're saying that the order was incorrect from the beginning, from almost a year ago?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or from—\n\nSpeaker 2: No, at the beginning I was trying that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But recently, within the last three months, I've been trying to—I've been submitting, trying to get the AGV. I—\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't know what happened. So the last couple orders have been wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. Okay. So yeah, I'm sorry we got into this now. So—\n\nSpeaker 2: Adjusting to the AGV is a little bit easier over the phone if you were wanting to get the AGV here. Let me take a look as—\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you're right, yeah, you did just have a recent prescription go out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just had time for a reason prescription and generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, so I apologize. You know, we didn't hear from you over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not sure what was done online with the different prescription or at what point that adjustment was made.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, if you wanted, I'd be happy to send you the AGVs free to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I could get you a sample of it to make up for that, and I could put your account on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can see if the AGVs work differently for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you could give me a call back and let me know how you want to proceed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I do that? I'll try the trial run and see what happens with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so just know that's good. You're going to get two orders, okay? So the first one that's going to be delivered will be the—\n\nSpeaker 1: Standard generics that the script was written for. Okay, the second item that you're going to receive will be the AGV one.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way you're going to tell the model is AGV is it will say sildenafil AGV on the front on the bottom right-hand corner.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will say Greenstone LLC.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the Pfizer labs in France. Okay, the ones you're getting right now are from Apco Pharma in New Jersey.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's the big difference, and the pills themselves will have 100 on it where you say AC 320 or another generic code.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, give these a try. I can also provide you with my extension so you can call me back directly. Would you like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, well, I'm on the run, so I don't have pen and paper with me. Okay. I don't know if you can send me—\n\nSpeaker 2: Send me a text or send a text, but if you do that, I'll take information on the text.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm unable to send a text, but it's just zero zero four two. So 42 is my extension and my name—\n\nSpeaker 2: And Nick and I see K I.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can do that? That's my son's name.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. So, you know who to call?\n\nSpeaker 1: Once you get these, if you have any questions, feel free to give a call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: But like I said, I'll send you that sample to make up for all, you know—\n\nSpeaker 1: These and see if we can get you something that works a little bit better. Okay, so this will be 10—\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 milligram Viagra AGV on the house, and I'm going to put your account on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. I'm willing to try. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. You're very welcome. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
