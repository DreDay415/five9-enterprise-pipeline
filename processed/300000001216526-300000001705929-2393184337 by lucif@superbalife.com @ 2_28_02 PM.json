Is this your phone number on file?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so yeah, that was just one of your refills that went up there, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do not have to get them that way. You can choose when you get your refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I didn't order, I just got charged a second time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm assuming it's because when you first order this,\n\nSpeaker 1: you've got to set it up to either like to just get it once, order as needed,\n\nSpeaker 2: or, you know, to get it at whatever frequency you would like.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it's not done, it'll kind of go out how the doctor writes it according to the pills that you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that's what happened here.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, we can definitely change that so that does not happen going forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. I didn't even use so far, you know, I didn't have girls for some time, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I don't need it right now, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you can just return that money on my account and I'm going to order as I need.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so basically how that works, sir, we're just going to,\n\nSpeaker 1: so like the next four months here we won't bill you or send you anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to have to call to get your next order in like the next four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I can order when I need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could be two months, could be three months, could be, you know, could be one month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, so basically what we do is we just keep your prescription available,\n\nSpeaker 1: say for five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need more time, let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the prescription doesn't stay open forever,\n\nSpeaker 2: so we can keep it open for you for the next five months and you would have to call us for your next one.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you need more time, then let us know as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can give you my extension and my name here, and that way you can call me directly.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, I am ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you start again, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the number, the phone number is?\n\nSpeaker 2: The extension number is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I just want to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I got the first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's over there waiting, and you are going to return this money on my account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm going to give you a call when I'm ready, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm waiting for this to return to my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you, Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
