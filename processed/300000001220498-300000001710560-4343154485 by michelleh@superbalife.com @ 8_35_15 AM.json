    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm calling to see about canceling\n\nSpeaker 2: the prescription I have for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: William, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-4-58.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is your VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see the doctor put you on refills\n\nSpeaker 1: on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've seen them canceling, it's not doing anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's why I was asking,\n\nSpeaker 2: because it looks like here,\n\nSpeaker 1: it looks like the pharmacy just sent you\n\nSpeaker 2: the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did not receive the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you happen to have them on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, you received just the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna get you out of replacement,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'm gonna tell you how you can confirm\n\nSpeaker 2: you received the correct AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the, what is the other thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: The other one is Pfizer's latest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they switched around the inactive ingredients,\n\nSpeaker 2: which makes it powerful and work faster,\n\nSpeaker 1: and less side effects, especially less headaches,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it lasts for 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second, I'll get you out of those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so when you get this new bottle in the mail\n\nSpeaker 1: in a few days, this is how you're gonna tell\n\nSpeaker 2: you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: So on the bottle, it's gonna say AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pills, the only number imprinted\n\nSpeaker 1: is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm\n\nSpeaker 1: you received the FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because right now, when you get the new bottle,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can compare, but your bottle right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: your bottles probably say APCO,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then on the pill, they have the letters AC imprinted,\n\nSpeaker 2: followed by the numbers 390 or 340.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can just toss those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm gonna go ahead and pause your refills\n\nSpeaker 1: for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna pause it till July 31st, 2026,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll give you my extension so you can call me\n\nSpeaker 2: and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that'd be great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, let me.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm sending you 40 instead of 30.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's that gonna cost me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing, because they sent you the incorrect medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes that happens when they,\n\nSpeaker 1: the pharmacy runs out of AGV every now and then,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they don't tell us, and they send generics,\n\nSpeaker 1: which causes issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm glad you called and sent you out the correct one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know they did give you anything but just that,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I was wondering.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, they sent you just generic, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not what you were supposed to get.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, what you got?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, my extension is 0020,\n\nSpeaker 1: and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0020, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And June, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, I'm glad I could help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry for the inconvenience that we got you taken care of.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
