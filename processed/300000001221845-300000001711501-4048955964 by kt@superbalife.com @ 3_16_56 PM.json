    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Alfred? Yes sir. So thank you so much for being kind, polite, and respectful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate your tender. So we're eating an elephant here but let me just kind of\n\nSpeaker 1: go over what I did first. Just kind of put you on the right path and that way\n\nSpeaker 2: we don't work backwards here. But God bless you. The first thing I did is I put\n\nSpeaker 1: a stop to any and all monthly refills. The second thing I did is I put a stop\n\nSpeaker 2: to any and all monthly shipments. And the third thing I did is I put a stop to any\n\nSpeaker 1: and all monthly charges. And I paused your prescription and this order for\n\nSpeaker 2: January 28th I was trying to get out, I put a stop to that and I credit you back\n\nSpeaker 1: the $113.95. Thank you. Because I'm so glad you called in because if you haven't\n\nSpeaker 2: received them and this went out, that means you won't receive that. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So there's two things. When's the last time you did receive it? Probably\n\nSpeaker 2: September. Yeah. So this is how it would work, bud. And now I'm going to read off\n\nSpeaker 1: what I see. These are two things we can do to make you whole again. So your\n\nSpeaker 2: address is 2030 Brentbrook Trail, right? Wait, wait, wait. It's Bent, B-E-N-T, B-R-O-O-K-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: Trail. Trail. And Lawrenceville, right? Lawrenceville, yeah. Georgia, right? This is where I did my\n\nSpeaker 2: training. Yes. And then not 30043. That's affirmative, right? Correct. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So if you weren't getting it there, there must be fraud or theft and here's\n\nSpeaker 2: why. It's not your fault. What happens is when people shake these pills, they\n\nSpeaker 1: know what's going on, you know, even though it's the street. But this was\n\nSpeaker 2: delivered in the mailbox December 3rd, 2025, right? Yes, sir. When's the last time you\n\nSpeaker 1: checked your mailbox? Today. Okay. So what I would highly recommend is when\n\nSpeaker 2: you go to scoreblue.com, well you can't even do that. Let me figure out the way\n\nSpeaker 1: here. Give me some time to do a due diligence on this. But in the interim,\n\nSpeaker 2: what I'm going to do is I'm going to send you 10 pills for just for now because\n\nSpeaker 1: you got charged for 25, but I'm going to make note of this. I just can't send you\n\nSpeaker 2: 25 to replace that. It's going to be free anyways. Go ahead. Okay. So yeah, what I\n\nSpeaker 1: was going to say is I'd just like to cancel it all together. Yeah, so that's\n\nSpeaker 2: fine. I put a stop to everything, right? And I would want to cancel two for two\n\nSpeaker 1: reasons. One, I didn't receive it. I got charged. Three, if the damn thing wasn't\n\nSpeaker 2: working because when I was looking at your chart, right, and just bear with me\n\nSpeaker 1: Alfred, I noticed some unanswered questions here. And if you don't mind,\n\nSpeaker 2: because if this guy wrote the wrong prescription from what you actually asked,\n\nSpeaker 1: it really doesn't matter on that. Now if I decide to order again, I'll go through\n\nSpeaker 2: those steps and make sure everything is answered correctly. But at this time, I'd\n\nSpeaker 1: just like to cancel it and be done. Yeah, so I did it and I hear you out and I did\n\nSpeaker 2: definitely put a stop to any and all monthly refills. I put a stop to any and\n\nSpeaker 1: all monthly charges and I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments. And what I\n\nSpeaker 2: did here is I set up the dashboard. So when you go to scoreblue.com, right, and\n\nSpeaker 1: you log in, log in with your royalties.com, right? You're going to log in with that\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're going to go to a category called receipts. You'll see the refunded\n\nSpeaker 1: amount, okay? Okay, okay. Now the second thing you're going to do is I put a red\n\nSpeaker 2: button under your prescription. I put a red button there that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you don't have to go through the whole thing again. You can click that\n\nSpeaker 2: button anytime, anywhere, anyplace. As long as you update the address, you can\n\nSpeaker 1: click the button, but I made the adjustment instead of you getting 25, every\n\nSpeaker 2: time it's 10. Okay. So you can click that so you have full autonomy. The only\n\nSpeaker 1: caveat is legally in Georgia, we're not authorized to refill more than one refill\n\nSpeaker 2: in a 30-day period and then two refills a year, 20 pills. You did 20 pills in like\n\nSpeaker 1: two months, you know what I mean? But when you get a chance, call me at 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Goodrich is the last name. Okay. And I'll make note that when you call back\n\nSpeaker 1: or you click the button, I'll make some way to make you whole again, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you didn't want to chase that down with the post office, I'll find some\n\nSpeaker 1: way to take good care of you, right, bud? But either way, we will. So just know that\n\nSpeaker 2: I put that button there, I refunded you, and then if there's any consolation to\n\nSpeaker 1: you, you had a good experience with this, because I'm up for review, please email\n\nSpeaker 2: support at scoreblue.com and let them know.\n\nSpeaker 1: That I will do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Support at scoreblue.com. All right, bud? Any dollar would help me, bud, here.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're here in California. We need a new governor. Can you imagine that? No, I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: telling you the truth. Man, Alfred, I was homeless during COVID and I fought my ass\n\nSpeaker 1: out of it. I just pretend like I was back in Afghan, you know, like I thought I was\n\nSpeaker 2: just doing camping and I just used my skill set to get out of it. But then we get these\n\nSpeaker 1: damn governors, you know, like this, and these guys just don't give a damn. They didn't\n\nSpeaker 2: help any veterans, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, they're rocking you guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're rocking you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: We need this place to be a red state again, not no blue state, man. So, you know, I miss\n\nSpeaker 2: you guys there in Georgia, Tennessee, Oklahoma. I miss all you guys, man. I gotta go back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man, you know what? Do some research on our state, on our governor, Brian Kemp. He is\n\nSpeaker 2: something else. He really is. We are running a surplus where we'll get another check\n\nSpeaker 1: because they're running the state so efficiently that they're not spending the money that we're\n\nSpeaker 2: paying in taxes and they're giving it back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow. Hey, you know what? Efficiency is key, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is. And he's an honest guy, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we need to get rid of these, what do we call them again? These career politicians\n\nSpeaker 2: that really have no business.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're just running on old family names.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have no business because people don't realize when they get out of office, they're still\n\nSpeaker 1: getting paid.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely, yeah. And your senators and congresswomen from California are just, ugh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they're garbage, man. They're garbage. I hate to say it, but, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll figure it out. I was just in Alabama, too, like two months ago, and I miss you guys\n\nSpeaker 1: down there, the good old South, you know, good Christian men and women that are just,\n\nSpeaker 2: you guys are holding it down for us, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you get a chance, Mr. Alfred, just know that I refunded you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a pause on this. I put a stop to all the monthly refills, monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: I set up that red button for you so you can order at your leisure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you do, if there's any consolation, sir, really help me support at scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Caden Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just do something honest, you know, like just say whatever you feel in your heart.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I pray you, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: I pray you, Mark 1124.\n\nSpeaker 1: Therefore, I say to you, my brethren, whatever things you ask when you pray,\n\nSpeaker 2: believe that you receive them and you will have them in the name of Jesus, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Covered and sealed by his blood. All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you for letting me be of service and helping a good old man.\n\nSpeaker 1: You stay true. Be well, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. You take care. Adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You, too. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
