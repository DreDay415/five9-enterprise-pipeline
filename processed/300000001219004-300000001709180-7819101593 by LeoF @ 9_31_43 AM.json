Um, can you tell me?\n\nSpeaker 1: To be specialist not right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we're doing right now our Viagra AGV. The best deal is 40 pills for 149. It's like our lowest price per pill point.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is it? What is that AGV? What is this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's authorized generic Viagra. That's our newest pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: It works in as little as 11 minutes and last up to 14 hours in your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, great. Good good. If I order it on the phone, I won't have—\n\nSpeaker 1: It won't be automatic every month, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do is pause the service for you for as long as six months at a time. That way you can always like—\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us whenever you need the orders. It'll never come automatically.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just have to call us like once a year and say hey—\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to order and schedule the next one for six months out and then you just call us before that date again or—\n\nSpeaker 1: If you need longer that as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll never be on new—I don't want the auto.\n\nSpeaker 1: So no, so I would have to set it for as—I can't just put like a one-time order?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I would have to set a tentative refill date for six months in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we won't send that out as long as we hear from you before that six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to call it just like today, say hey, what's going on Leo? What's up with my orders? What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: I want one. I don't want one. We just have to hear from you basically once a year.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, great. Okay, perfect. Perfect. Did you want to the 40 pills then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please. What's your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I can—what is it? Can you do more or less? So or use the most currently?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm. And what was your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: All screwy.\n\nSpeaker 2: History are oh, I Mr. Screw. I have you at PO box 2 3 1 Kingston 0 2 3 6 4. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, and I have a visa here that ends in nine zero zero seven. Is that okay to use today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, so you're all set. Paul, your order's been placed. Like I said, that next tentative date is for July.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just call us back anytime before July and then let us know what's going on and we'll go from there. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there any confirmation number or anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, you have an order number here. You should get an email as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're all set there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you'll see that it'll ship out this week. It'll ship out today most likely and arrive in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that's like by the end of the week.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, great. Thanks. Thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye now. Yeah.",
