    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. I had purchased some...\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, online.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: And didn't realize it was a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to cancel the subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, Clifford. I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 18-19-53.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see the doctor put you on monthly refills, which you're not required to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's what I was asking. Do you happen to have the pills on you by chance?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because here I see the pharmacy notes.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like they just sent you the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did not receive the AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, give me a second. I'm going to get you out a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pharmacy must have ran out of the AGV, and they didn't tell us.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I can get you out the correct medication as a replacement free of charge,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you received the incorrect medication in the first place.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second, and then I'll tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to switch it to 100 milligrams as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so when you get this new bottle in the mail in a few days, it's going to say AGV on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's also going to say the name Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's pharmacy in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those are the two ways you can confirm you received the Pfizer AGV Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: because right now your bottles probably say APCO, and on the pill it says AC something.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what I'm going to do, I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause it until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, if I cancel it now, it's going to delete your profile,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the pharmacy will not be able to send you out the correct replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll give you my extension so you can call me back and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 0020, and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, Clifford.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
