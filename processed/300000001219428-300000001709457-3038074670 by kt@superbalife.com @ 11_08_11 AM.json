    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Miles?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, Miles, dude, I'm glad I crossed your path, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're on the same age, too, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take down my name and my extension.\n\nSpeaker 2: She can always get a hold of me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did something very, very special for you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, my name is K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to get a person.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to text you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 1: K.T. Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Rich.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, just the letter K, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Letters K and T, like Kilo Tango, Killer Tomato, and as a veteran, I take a lot of pride, bud,\n\nSpeaker 1: in my work in San Diego.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I miss you guys, too, because I was training at Atos Jiu-Jitsu for about 12 years, bro.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to get my black belt from those guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Those guys are the best in the world, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: But nevertheless, let me give you the numbers, 1-800, the same number you called, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: But my extension is 0037, Miles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't ever leave a voicemail, because I don't chase voicemails.\n\nSpeaker 1: By the time I do, you're gone already.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just leave your number with one of my colleagues.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I step away the restroom, I'll call you back that day, that hour, or that day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if you leave a voicemail, you talk to the voicemail, and then I'm going to chase tell, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd rather just call you back.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I did three things for you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just remember, my extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I paused your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I elevated you, because no one's actually done this.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I took the liberty to do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I elevated to delete status.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what that means is when you get a chance, Miles, go to scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Log in with your phone under a category.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see it says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, anytime, anywhere, you can even go to Vegas, put your shipping address there with your hotel room, click that button.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send it to your hotel.\n\nSpeaker 1: All you have to do then is tip the butler, have him send the ladies up so you can do a little menage a trois or something like that, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but in light of what I did, too, bud, the special thing I did, because you've been with us for quite some time,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I have the ability to do it, for free, because you've been on these generics for a while, we came up with the AGV that's a time release.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a lot more affordable, too, compared to what you're paying.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 10 of them to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: This one's on us.\n\nSpeaker 2: You enjoy it, because the other ones weren't working as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me know if you love them, and then we'll go from there or click the button, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you 10 for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, zero cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: The beauty and power of this stuff, Myles, is as long as you don't take it with any highly processed food, like ultra processed food or refined sugars,\n\nSpeaker 2: like highly processed oils, grape seed, right, and canolas and vegetables, the time release is special.\n\nSpeaker 1: It goes smooth down your esophagus with no acid reflex, no headache, and it disperses like a hand grenade.\n\nSpeaker 2: It shoots to the inner lining of your gut membrane, and your gut membrane tells your brain, your hippocampus,\n\nSpeaker 1: to send about 70% of blood to your heart, so your heart sends it to your schlong or your jonson,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it lasts up to 10 to 13 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the only caveat to this with side effects is whoever that lucky gal is,\n\nSpeaker 2: she might spray blood, so be ready for that with a raincoat or something, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll get an umbrella.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get an umbrella.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't rain in San Diego, but I'll get an umbrella.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyhow, you'll love these.\n\nSpeaker 1: These are really good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's new and approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me know if you need more, or you can just click that button.\n\nSpeaker 1: My number is 0037, and I sent 10 of them to your Escondido, the Overlook Street, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and don't worry about any monthly charges or anything, monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you need more, click that button or call me, and let me know how things go,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we can go from there, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I do have one other question for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure, yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I see that I was just charged recently, yesterday or the day before, for that monthly refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I called several times over the last few weeks to try to cancel before that next charge came through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you can do, bud, is no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you can do is you can take the bottle, and you would have to,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you opened up the package already, right, to look at what was inside, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I haven't gotten it yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's on the way, I'm sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay, so let me look.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so what you do is just circle the address on the top left,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then put refused, return to sender, drop it in the box, all right, like a blue box,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then keep my extension until next week around Thursday, Friday, call me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'll release the funds because the pharmacy has to scan it,\n\nSpeaker 2: then we can release it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll start the credit process, and I'll make note of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Plus, I gave you the refills kind of to make you whole, so it puts the cherry on top.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll get the $73.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: I sent a replacement for the stuff that wasn't working anymore, and then we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll make sure we get your money back, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I'm not worried about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys have been a good way every time I've handled things with you in the past.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, we're American.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know how we roll?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're definitely not calling me Belenzuela.\n\nSpeaker 2: And even if you called ice on us, buddy, no one else would go back to their hometown, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: because we're all Americans, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take care of Miles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 2: Katie, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very thorough, and it was fun talking to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So thank you for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I'm a San Diegan, but, you know, I love you guys down there, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to move back, but I'm going to move back to Bankersill, you name it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I miss you guys over there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if there's anything I could ask, if there's no consolation, just go to support at SCOREblue,\n\nSpeaker 1: support at SCOREblue, and just write what you organically took away from this call,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I'm up for review, and I could definitely use the extra $10 or whatever it is, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: just to cover the 35% being single, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Will I find that from the SCOREblue website, or did you say it's support.SCOREblue or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it's just support at SCOREblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you could just use your Gmail and just say, hey, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: whatever you think you took away, what I did is I did three things, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a stop to the monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to the monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put a stop to the monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: I paused the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I started the credit process back of the $73.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: So by next week when we return that refill, we'll give you the money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I sent you a replacement for a new and improved AGV, FDA-approved,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's time-release for free to put you at whole, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But just a few things over the top, bro.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all about experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's true.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are wowing.\n\nSpeaker 2: You are giving me a wow customer experience right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You were going to look into sending me a rain jacket or something you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I wanted to put another button there that says quick girl, girlfriend.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you click it, you've got to give me her demographics, 38, 34, 36,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'll just click that button and she'll come over.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as you're Latina.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, hazel eyes and Latina.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hazel eyes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you take care, Miles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Always a pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just remember, let me know if you need anything at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll get you that money next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then support at scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do it right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, Miles.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Aloha.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless you, Murphy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Aloha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, you know I'm from the Mariana Islands, dude.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mahalo, dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm listening to your voice.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was guessing you were from somewhere like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you, brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
