I ordered the ABG a couple days ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just wondering if the status has already been shipped or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. If you don't mind, sir, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 32904.\n\nSpeaker 2: Holacek?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And your mailing address is 7617 Ellis Road in Melbourne, Florida, 32904?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it should show there. It should show the tracking number because it already shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, let me ask you this. If I'm in my account, would I see it here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're supposed to see it there. So let me take a look there with me just a second, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you go into your prescription...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Oh, hello, dummy, January 27th. Hello. So that's supposed to be, what, probably three or four days, give or take?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. So if you click on track, if you just click on that button, it'll show that it's supposed to arrive on the 31st, which is Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. As usual, you guys are the best. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
