    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hi. My last name is Rukiza.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Rukiza, how can I help you today? Is John available?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me check if John...\n\nSpeaker 1: No, he's not yet available. I can either help you or I can have him return.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I did, what I did, I purchased a score blue\n\nSpeaker 1: the Viagra, the regular one, and you guys sent me the regular one, and I purchased the one with another...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see that he replaced it on the 20th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I...\n\nSpeaker 2: John told me he was going to cancel that, threw it away, and he's going to send me the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. The one that I purchased, and I never got anything, so I'm planning on canceling the bank account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, this was delivered...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so when you spoke to John on the 20th,\n\nSpeaker 2: they reshipped the correct AGVs to you. According to the Postal Service,\n\nSpeaker 1: this was delivered to Menifee, California at 92584 on January 23rd at 1:43 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you checked your mobile?\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't received anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, did you check your mail or...\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm checking my mail. I checked my, my, they have a box right here, right at the end of my cul-de-sac,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I checked it, and it's nothing in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to know if you sent it, otherwise I'd cancel the bank account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me send you this, okay? This is a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on a second. Is this your, is this your mobile number? 951-551-6632?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm going to text this to you. Okay, I'm not going to waste your time with an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: Tracking number with who?\n\nSpeaker 1: A tracking number with the U.S. Postal Service. It's a federal agency.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're calling ScoreBlue, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm asking you who you're going to track her with.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just told you it's the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Postal Service? Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. The same people that delivered your first one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that I don't remember. I just saw the box. I opened it. It's a regular one.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a regular Viagra. It didn't have the other extension. It's just large.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. I'm confused. What are you telling me?\n\nSpeaker 2: What I purchased, it was a Viagra with the other three digits, which it says large.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, when you take Viagra, you get hard and then you get large.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the one I received, the regular, the ones that everybody buy before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, my question to you is this. Did you receive a second shipment from us, yes or no? No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I just sent you, if you check your cell phone, I just sent you a text message with a link,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay, from the U.S. Postal Service, your mailman, the mailman.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me check. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says spam. I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sending you an email. I sent you a text.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know. I'm looking at a text.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at all my texts.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says spam. That's all I got right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says maybe a spam from 413, is the area code?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the 424 number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, hang on a second. Let me check it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't see anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do not see a message that says, hello, Mr. O'Keefe?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't have any messages.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have any messages.\n\nSpeaker 2: To the number 951-551-6632, you did not receive any text message?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know what's up with your phone, because I send multiple text messages.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, hang on a second. Let me check my phone, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, go check your phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got two phones in here, so I'm going to delete the other one.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is so strange.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send me an email?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Is your email address Leonard, L-E-O-N-A-R-D at SecutraEngineering?\n\nSpeaker 1: Secutra.com, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I think I got the tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's, hello, Mr. Kiesha, here's your tracking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, click on the link.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the tracking number is 405536207699.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't need that. I need you to click on the link.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am on the...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We need you to click on the link.\n\nSpeaker 1: I am on the...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, the hyperlink will show you. It will redirect you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it says tracking number 94055362076, that one?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you click on the link, if you touch the link, it will take you to USPS.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the US Postal Service.com website.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it shows there delivered, delivered in or at mailbox,\n\nSpeaker 2: Menifee, California, 92584, January 23rd at 1:43 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you had asked me for the tracking number to prove that we shipped it and delivered it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is approved from the Postal Service, which is a federal agency, that your mailman...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know. I know who they are.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to know that January 23rd is when I got it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what it says.\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what it says, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I need to talk to them then. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sure. All right. Let us know what happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
