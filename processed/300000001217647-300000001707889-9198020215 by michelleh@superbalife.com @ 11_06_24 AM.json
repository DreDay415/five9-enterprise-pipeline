    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'd like to get my prescription with you all refilled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem, Ken. I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 5-9-59.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to do another quantity of 50, 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, that worked out pretty well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, actually it would be a quantity of 25 because you did a one pill upgrade that time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then the refills would just be a quantity of 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you can do a quantity of 40. A quantity of 40 is $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: A quantity of 25 is $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's do the 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, are we still using your Visa ending in 6571?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I need to put it on something else. It's a Visa, but it's a different one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. I'm ready when you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's 48-09-9010-7694-8110.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 0-30, and the code is 0-2-30, and the code is 7-1-3.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I think there's going to be a little problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the address you have for me?\n\nSpeaker 1: 72 Terrace Way, Jasper, Georgia, 301-43.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why it was sent there, but I live in Puerto Rico now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that as your billing address. I don't think we ship to Puerto Rico.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh. I wonder how I got it before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you have a neighbor just pick it up and mail it to you that way?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm not. I mean, it's not going to work. Oh, God.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me think about it, and I'll call you back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't run that right now. Let me think about how I can do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give us a call back today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if I can do that. I don't know if I can figure it out that fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'm going to cancel it. I'm going to cancel it because if I don't cancel it, it'll ship it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't ship here to Puerto Rico?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, the telehealth rules, we can't ship. I know we don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, let me ask real quick. Hold on one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how I would have gotten it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I see your billing address is your Puerto Rico address,\n\nSpeaker 1: and your shipping address is your Georgia address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me just ask somebody just to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know we don't ship to Canada. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
