I have Joseph Bowers in Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It looks like you're a VIP member here, Joseph.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you just way overstocked right now and need to pump the brakes?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm good for a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good for a while. I could pause everything from now until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if that will help you out, but that gives you some time to use up what you got\n\nSpeaker 2: and let us know when you need it earlier.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's fine. Just cancel me for now, and if I need it, I'll sign back up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, though. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good. All right. You're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.",
