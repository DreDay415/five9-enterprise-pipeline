    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure to speak with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Derek Burke.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Derek. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. I'm glad to hear it. Okay, Derek, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, for one, I didn't know I had signed up for automatic shipments, which I wanted to try at one time before I started committed to, you know, ordering these again.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you've already charged PayPal another second month of something I didn't recall signing up for.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I never received – I paid $60-something for it. It never arrived here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know where it's at or whatever. I just don't appreciate paying for something that, one, I didn't think that I ordered and, two, I never received.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I mean, yeah, I can definitely help you with all of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want to receive regular refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place the prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it – and the way that works is if you did want to order before then, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you are ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the reason you received that refill is because when you did place the initial order, a screen that pops up says – it says a few things.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in the final paragraph it says, your doctor or medical provider will most likely give you a monthly prescription for your Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Our pharmacy cannot exceed the amount or dosage, strength, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can cancel or pause any doctor-approved pharmacy prescriptions at any time by calling our customer service department at 1-800-675-9807.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's this number right now that you were calling.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you do want to return the product for a refund, you certainly have that option.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we have a pretty generous 120-day leeway policy for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can definitely email you the instructions for how to do that as long as you've opened it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you haven't opened it, you might even have another option for returning it.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can just email you the instructions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or if you already paid for it, you can keep them.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, I mean, of course you don't have to receive those regular refills if you don't want to.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want the regular refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first order is fine because that's what I thought I would sign it up for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your webpage does not make it easy.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very deceptive as far as where you can't cancel anything on the webpage.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't even see where I signed up for recurring prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the one that I was just recently charged for, which says it was delivered on the 22nd, which was yesterday,\n\nSpeaker 1: I never received it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't return something I never received.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yet I was billed for it already.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, I find that problematic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me pull up the tracking number and see about this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it actually says it was delivered this morning at 7.56 a.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: So have you checked the mail today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've checked the mail twice.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And one thing, the post office sends me, you know, like a delivery, you know, like you're expecting delivery.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says it was picked up from the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't say it was delivered here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says somebody picked it up from the post office, which definitely wasn't me because I didn't even know it was going to be there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, for one, I wouldn't even know what post office to go to.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's something really screwed up with this shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, the address we have on file, which is the only one we could have possibly shipped it to,\n\nSpeaker 1: is 3418 Penn Oak Circle, Atlanta, Georgia, 30340.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that first shipment that we shipped did seem to easily get to the appropriate address,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I'm assuming is your home address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I did get the first shipment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have not got the second shipment, which I wasn't really expecting until I checked my PayPal account and saw that,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, I was charged for a second shipment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I mean, it should arrive today because it said it did arrive today.\n\nSpeaker 1: And because you haven't opened it, that is a beneficial position where once you do receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: as long as you do not open it, you can just do return to sender straight back to us,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we can process your refund the minute we receive it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you wouldn't have to go to the post office or, you know, through the whole, you know, hurrah of, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: getting a tracking number, doing the whole thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, I mean, if you want the directions for how to do that, I can definitely also send you those.\n\nSpeaker 1: All that I can operate based off of is using the tracking number of what we did send out,\n\nSpeaker 2: which shows that it was delivered today at 7.56 a.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that didn't happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm telling you, it didn't happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if it went to the wrong mailbox, possibly.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I didn't get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you don't get mail at that time in the morning anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it would have been this afternoon, and I checked the regular mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they put it in the mailbox or, I don't know, are they supposed to deliver it to the front porch?\n\nSpeaker 1: How does it come?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think the last time it was in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't know it comes because it comes in the exact same way that your first package sent to the exact same address,\n\nSpeaker 2: which you received at comfortably within two to five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's not there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: The best I can do is I can offer you a one-time reshipment, and I could do a signature upon delivery,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then, you know, you would definitely receive it, and it could be yours to keep, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted to return it, you could, but that wouldn't really make a lot of sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, as a one-time offer, I could reship for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: even though the facts in front of my face state that it was delivered to you this morning at the correct address,\n\nSpeaker 2: just like the last shipment we sent you, January 23rd at 7.56 a.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is going to be shipped to 3418 Pin Oak Circle, Atlanta, Georgia, 30340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's the correct address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I will message shipping to send this with a signature, and then they will, and that will be great,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you'll definitely receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, I'll place your prescription on hold so that you're not receiving those regular refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you need anything before the end of July, you can just reach out to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can call us, place an order, let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me use this tracking number and ask them to send with a signature upon delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you'll probably get it, you know, there is like this winter storm or whatever, but other than that,\n\nSpeaker 1: you should usually get it by, like, next Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess because of the storm, maybe it could be something like Friday, but maybe it will be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who even knows, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Replacement, so we make sure you are not charged for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to send it to them right now and say,\n\nSpeaker 1: please send this replacement as a reship with signature upon delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: The last one was not received.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so you'll receive that soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you always know where to find us at this phone number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Derek.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
