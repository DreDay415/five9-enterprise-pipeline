I got a question to ask about a...\n\nSpeaker 1: I got some of that Viagra AVG or AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to find out what the process is.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says it's pharmacy, but I don't understand what you mean.\n\nSpeaker 1: That means that it's at our pharmacy. We're going to mail it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's just one step away from it being put in the mail to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good. It means you've been approved and everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: About how long does it take?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it takes about five to seven days from the day you ordered it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ah, shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're in Fort Worth, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was put in the mail today, so it is in the mail now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it said it's about one to five days to get, so I wasn't sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you. Well, yeah, once it ships, it's like two to five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's coming out of Kentucky, but yours already shipped, so it should be to you pretty quick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I was hoping to get it tomorrow, but unfortunately it won't. I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all right. I just wanted to check and make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thanks, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.",
