Box 712?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and I have MasterCard ending in 3972.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, will I continue to get the auto-refill on the Viagra too?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it's probably more like March or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, one cancels out the other.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's going to change your prescription to the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll have to call us back if you want to change that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I go with 20 of them instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's 10 in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: For 20 of them, it would be $159.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my wife, I think.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and that's for 24 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: 24 of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that sounds like a much better deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is, yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir, that successfully went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll fulfill that order and ship it out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then when will the auto-refill actually be on a different schedule now?\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like it was set up for three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your next order will not be until April 26th, unless, of course,\n\nSpeaker 2: you call in before then to make any changes, delay, or make an order before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.",
