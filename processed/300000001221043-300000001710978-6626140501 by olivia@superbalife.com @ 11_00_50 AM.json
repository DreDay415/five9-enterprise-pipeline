    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name's Doug.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Doug. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. How can I help you today, Doug?\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can definitely help you with that. Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty, Doug. What is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: June 22, 70.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And you're located at 1602 Dolly Tub Road?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're located at 1602 Dolly Tub Road, Amory, Mississippi, 38821.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I do see you here.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you don't want to receive those regular refills with your prescription anymore, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option with the prescription to place it on hold for up to six months at a time. So six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is if you did want to order before then, you could. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you're on the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need the prescription canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the pills, they didn't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, then that makes sense. If they didn't work for you, you don't need this prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so you know, we are currently offering a promotional offer to folks whose current script isn't working for them, but who haven't tried our newest stuff. We are sending out a free sample to those interested who haven't tried it, which looks like you, of our highest quality, fastest acting, newest Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It comes from our Pfizer labs in France. And like I mentioned, it is the fastest acting, longest lasting stuff we've ever made.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is that we specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: The 10 free pills, they come with a six month free trial. So you would have until July to try them out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Make sure you love them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Make sure you prefer them to your old scripts.\n\nSpeaker 2: We believe that you would, and we believe that, you know, 10 pills, you'd use them by July. You'd give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'd order some.\n\nSpeaker 2: We might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills and you'd have until July to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they are a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're definitely the best stuff on the market.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if your current stuff isn't working, I can at least promise you that these are a better product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, they would be free.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the ones from the recent refill, if you do want to send those back for a refund, you certainly can.\n\nSpeaker 2: They might not have even sent them out yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can try to find out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if they haven't, I can cancel the order and refund it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me try to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me see what I can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So here's what's going to happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're going to get back to me shipping, I mean, that's what I'm talking about, anywhere from the next 20 to 30 minutes to the next three hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: They probably haven't sent this out for you yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I hope they haven't.\n\nSpeaker 1: So then I'll just be able to cancel and refund it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if I'm able to do that, I'll send you an email.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I wasn't, for whatever reason, able to do that, I'll send you an email just saying, hey, you know, if those aren't working for you, once you receive these in five days, just write return to sender on the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you do not open it, they can bring it right back to us for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll send you a free sample of these new pills, which they're a great product, and I do really think you're going to like them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I mentioned, it'll be 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship it to 1602 Dolly Tub Road with two Bs at the end, Amory, Mississippi, 38821?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So these will be out to you probably within the next three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fingers crossed, I really hope I'm able to just cancel and refund your last refill, because I wouldn't want it to be confusing which one is the new free sample that is yours to keep and which one is the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yeah, fingers crossed.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if I'm able to refund it, I'll just send you an email and that'll be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need anything before July, we're always here, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: That new script that was started with the free sample is placed on hold for you until then.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I hope you love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a reminder, Doug, you always want to take these on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just don't eat with them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then avoid alcohol when you take them, just because alcohol restricts blood flow and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you so much, Doug.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you love these and I hope you have a great day and I hope I'm able to just cancel this recent refill and just refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I am, you'll hear from me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And even if I'm not, I'll send you the reminder of those directions for how to just send it right back to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do I need to, in July, call and cancel for again or?\n\nSpeaker 2: So if the pills, that's a good question.\n\nSpeaker 1: If the pills, that free sample that I just sent you, if they don't work for you, then yeah, you can call anytime before then.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they do work for you, right, and the way you're going to know they're the newest product, the one I just sent you, it's on the pills themselves.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to say 5-0 for 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the side of the bottle is going to say Greenstone, because that's the manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it should say AGV, which is good.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what the product is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if you like them, you're going to use them, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you'll run out in a few months, and you'll call us to order some.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you'll need to let us know how you want the script set up.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want to receive them every month, you don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have options.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll just have to let us know, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: If they don't work for you, then yes, just give us a call sometime, anytime before then, to let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you can cancel the script, of course, if they don't work for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not being billed anything?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: The free sample, I think it was completely free, and yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Doug.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
