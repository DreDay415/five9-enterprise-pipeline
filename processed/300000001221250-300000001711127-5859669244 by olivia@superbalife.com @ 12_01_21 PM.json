    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Olivia, hi, my name is Lorenzo Torres.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Lorenzo, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to cancel my subscription with Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 12-4-60.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you're located at 511 Cardez Drive, Rochester, New York?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, just so you know, you do always have the option with your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: that if you don't want to receive those regular ongoing refills, you don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you did want to order in the next six months\n\nSpeaker 2: but you did want to place it on hold, you could,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's just you'd have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd still like to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying a different pill, a different competitor of yours.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, the last part of my job is to let you know that if there is something else out there\n\nSpeaker 2: that you feel like is working better for you or that you are trying out,\n\nSpeaker 1: then you do qualify for a free sample of our newest highest quality product,\n\nSpeaker 2: which it looks like you haven't tried.\n\nSpeaker 1: The free sample is 10 pills, and it comes with a six-month free trial.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way you want to think about it is obviously this script doesn't work for you anymore,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it would be a new script of our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff\n\nSpeaker 2: that is started with that free sample of 10 pills and placed on hold for you until June for you to try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: My favorite thing about the product is we specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation\n\nSpeaker 2: and the headache and that it is FDA approved, third-party tested, all that good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is real Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, if you did want to compare it and contrast it with whatever you are getting elsewhere,\n\nSpeaker 1: we'd be happy to send you some, and then, you know, you'd have until June to try it out, see how you like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what we think would happen based off of the reviews, which are very good for the product,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that it would work for you, and within the next two to five months,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'd give us a call to place an order, and we might be able to keep you, and that would make it worth it to us.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if not, you know, you'd just have until June to let us know either way.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you would know pretty quickly how well the product works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're saying you have a product that you want me to try free of charge for 10 pills until June?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And there's no charge, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to charge my account for the old prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just on hold until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and it's 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, I'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send me the 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I like it, then I'll continue to order it in June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Understanding that my current prescription is on hold, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I won't be charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the current script is basically canceled out by this new one with the free sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, ideally, you like this one, and if you didn't, you'd know pretty quick,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you could just let us know before June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so can I ship these 10 pills, and I'm going to send them to you at 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ship them to 511 Carthage Drive, Rochester, New York, 14616?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, you should receive these in the next three to, I'll say, six or seven business days\n\nSpeaker 2: only because of that winter storm, but typically very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could even get them by Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, if you need anything before June, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're always here.\n\nSpeaker 1: This phone number, Monday through Friday, 8-5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you take these on an empty stomach, that's really important,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you avoid alcohol and caffeine when you take them, but especially alcohol,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they both restrict blood flow, but alcohol is worse, you should notice really good results.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I certainly hope that you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you so much, Lorenzo.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
