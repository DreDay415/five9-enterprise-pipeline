    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, this is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hi, my name is Russell Donahue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I just went and got, I got, for the first time, I got a squirrel broom.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I've been told that I had 10 more refills, and they're going to be automatically shipped to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Russell Donahue in Waco, Texas. Waco, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. As a VIP member here, we completely get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't necessarily need them every single month, we're very customer friendly here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what the problem was, it didn't, on the website, it never says that it's going to be,\n\nSpeaker 1: it does say it's very, it's hidden. It doesn't say that it's going to be.\n\nSpeaker 2: It does come with refills written with the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a standard practice for any medical industry.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can work with you on whatever your needs would best be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we completely get it if you don't need it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: For right now, we can set it so that it's like every three months, four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you've got some time to use up what you've got.\n\nSpeaker 2: They won't come as often.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you can work with us on when it's needed and when it's not needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're very customer friendly here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, I just want the one and done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Did you try the pills and were you just not a fan of them?\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried one. It worked. I've got other things, Cialis, and I've got older Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: that I've gotten from before that it never really worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I got from you all actually worked for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got enough to go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm kind of old, so I don't function as much as I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. I mean, fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not 22 anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hear you on that, Russell.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, if you'd like, I mean, like I said, we're very flexible here.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can do like every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it only basically comes like once a year, to be honest.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescription only lasts for a year to begin with.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 10 pills, I'm not sure how active you are, but, I mean, another 10 wouldn't come until July.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it gives you plenty of time to use what you've got.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you need them earlier, call us and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you need us to push it out some more, call us and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you know, we keep the prescription alive and in your back pocket\n\nSpeaker 2: because these things do get pretty pricey for us\n\nSpeaker 1: because we are the only FDA approved Viagra on the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you work with us, we'll work with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can pause everything right now for the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you take the auto refill off and I'll call in six months if I need it, I can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Other than that, I'd rather just do one and done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. That's basically what I meant.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we're not going to charge you every single month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no. I don't need another one automatically shipped to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the six months, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. If I need them in six months, I can always call back and say, hey, I need another shipment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't like auto shipments, subscription type things like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's not a subscription but a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So to keep the prescription alive, yeah, to keep the prescription alive,\n\nSpeaker 2: we have to have at least one set up for the year, just one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the rest of the time it's basically whenever you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't follow that. So whenever I need it, I can call and I get the other one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah. If we pause it for the six months, that's what keeps the prescription alive.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can't get any Viagra without a prescription, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you cancel it, you cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it takes a long time to get back on the prescription list for us\n\nSpeaker 1: because we're in such high demand right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, we're the only FDA approved Viagra with Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you really can't get this stuff anywhere else.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to do the six-month thing, we can do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Won't charge you or send you anything for the next six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can work with us in six months and say, hey, I need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't need it, push me about another couple months.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll work with you. Totally up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's do six months, and if I don't need it or I do need it, whatever,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll let you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Appreciate that. So July 27th then, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And what is your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Charles. My extension is 0040 if you ever need me again, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, Russell. Hope you have a great day. Absolutely. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye.",
