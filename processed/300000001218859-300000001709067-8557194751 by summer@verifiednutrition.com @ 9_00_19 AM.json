Now, what about these? I don't want to be billed for another bottle of these pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, just send them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pardon me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just send them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send them back?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, send them back. Just put them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we'll refund you, and it'll go back to the card.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do I do, yeah, how do I do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the, do you have the packaging?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, the address is on the packaging, or you can put it back into the packaging, tape it up, and get it back to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can just take it back to the post office and give it to them, and they'll return it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.
