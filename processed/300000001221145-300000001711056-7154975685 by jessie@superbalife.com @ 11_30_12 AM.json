    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last?\n\nSpeaker 2: Dan O'Donoghue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Mr. O'Donoghue. Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 54729.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you still at 7925 85th Avenue in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, super. Let's take a look here and it says here you wanted to cancel your refills, is that it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now this was set for just once every six months and that's just to keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: There is 25 still too many. If you'd like, we can keep the same program.\n\nSpeaker 1: But reduce the number of pills that you get so it keeps your prescription active to just get one refill at the end of six—\n\nSpeaker 2: months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when would the next one be due?\n\nSpeaker 2: The next one won't be until—\n\nSpeaker 1: July 30th, the end of July.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if 25 is too many, we can reduce it to 10 pills if you want to do that as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, you're saying July is the next one. But does that count the one that I have that I'm assuming is coming now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly. So the one now is for January, so January plus six months is July, which is the seventh month.\n\nSpeaker 1: The end of, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is my total—\n\nSpeaker 1: bill for—\n\nSpeaker 2: January?\n\nSpeaker 1: That one is 25 pills and that's $113.95. If you want to reduce it to 10 pills, meaning for some people—\n\nSpeaker 2: It's like 25 pills is just too much. If you want to do it for 10 pills, that's $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and cancel for now.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we do cancel though—\n\nSpeaker 1: The prescription, it sounds kind of crazy.\n\nSpeaker 2: But we can't refill the prescription or place any orders in the future. If you'd like, I can reduce the 10 pills to 49 for—\n\nSpeaker 1: you to keep your prescription active. Do you want to do that instead?\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean reduce it to 49?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the pharmacy has their own separate fee which is $14.95. That's what, you know, that's what increases that cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can set it to where you get one refill. If you don't order anything between now and July, you get one refill of 10—\n\nSpeaker 1: pills for 49 instead of $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we'll waive that pharmacy fee for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that would be $49 due today.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, not due today, in July.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what about the one that's going to be due today? Oh—\n\nSpeaker 2: That one's already gone out because that one charged on the 27th.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that was for how much?\n\nSpeaker 2: $113.95. I'm setting up your future one so that way you don't have to. It's not as hefty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Is there any way to recall today's?\n\nSpeaker 2: This one is already—\n\nSpeaker 1: I—\n\nSpeaker 2: can certainly try, but I can't make any guarantees because this was charged yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what I can do is fix up the future one so that way it's 10 pills for 49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now let's just go ahead and cancel everything, and if you can cancel today's, I'd appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, so it has been canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll see what we can do with the recent one.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I said, it was charged yesterday and it's shipped out, so well, I don't know what I can do with that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear in mind you can't place any orders in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye. Bye.",
