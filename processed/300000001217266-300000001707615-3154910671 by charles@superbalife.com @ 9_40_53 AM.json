    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra, this is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Charles, how are you, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, I ordered your store blue, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I called you to say I ordered it, and I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: please do not, you know, keep monthly doing it, and you did it anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: You called us and requested that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I did, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, did you call the number that was on the pill bottle by accident?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't know, I thought I called right when I ordered it online,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I seen it was a reoccurring.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I said, please do not do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll take your word for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take your word for it, Ernest.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I genuinely don't see any calls to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm afraid you might have called the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're in charge of just delaying the next order, not canceling anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the situation that we're facing right now, Ernest,\n\nSpeaker 1: this order is already on its way to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll be there today.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want it, all you need to do is write return to sender on it\n\nSpeaker 2: and put it back in the mailbox, and the mailman will take it\n\nSpeaker 1: and send it right back to us, and we can issue the refund for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let's leave this one here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just stop sending them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want, you are a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You are a VIP member here, so you do have options on the table to utilize.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of them is being able to pause or freeze your account\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't get them charged or sent to you for the next four months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you have time to use what you've got.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I want to stop it, and then if I want it, I'll call you back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, how does half a year sound so that way it doesn't come every month?\n\nSpeaker 2: It would only be once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because six months, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, because I'm going to go to my – I've had cancer,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I'm going to go to the urologist because I tried them,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it wasn't what I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're talking about these ones, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to go to the urologist and stick with them\n\nSpeaker 2: and see what they're going to do for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you really fast, Ernest, I don't want to sell you anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, we are with Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I just want to make sure that we don't leave any stone unturned with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you'd like, we do have another variation of the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send you a sample of it absolutely for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you'd like this one,\n\nSpeaker 1: if this one gives you that kick that you're looking for,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll still pause everything and just call us\n\nSpeaker 1: and let us know whenever you need the refills on your own time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I would like to be able to just call and do what I want,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I don't want to hate six months down the road you're hitting me again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to fix symptoms.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to fix symptoms, and yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not a young chicken anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, look, if you're willing to work with us, Ernest,\n\nSpeaker 2: we can work with you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: We only need one refill set up for the year technically\n\nSpeaker 2: just to keep the prescription alive.\n\nSpeaker 1: These things are expensive for us because we're FDA approved with Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you write down the date, July 27th,\n\nSpeaker 1: like on the pill bottle that you're using right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: I tell people all the time that allows you to see when the next refill is\n\nSpeaker 1: and then work with us on when you need it and when you don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Brother, we're very customer friendly.\n\nSpeaker 1: As long as you work with us, we'll work with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But as far as the prescription, we obviously want to keep it in your back pocket\n\nSpeaker 1: so that we're not paying for it over and over and over and over and over again.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's always better to just pay for it once.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way we have it in the back pocket so you order whenever you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So six months at a time is a very long time for you to use what you got\n\nSpeaker 1: and call in when you do need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, when you're my age, six months is a short period.\n\nSpeaker 1: You might use one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just cancel it and then we'll do it again.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I have any issues, I'll call back and we'll reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, Ernest.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Enjoy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
