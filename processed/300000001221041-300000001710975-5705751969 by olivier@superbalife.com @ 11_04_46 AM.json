You still have it in the package?\n\nSpeaker 2: You still have it in the package where it came with?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry?\n\nSpeaker 2: You still have it in the package where it came with?\n\nSpeaker 1: I took it out. I didn't know what it was.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually that package, it's because we don't charge you for shipping,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that package is usually what you use to return,\n\nSpeaker 1: so there is no fee to return that because you use the package we provide.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually that's how it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you open, you see it, you don't want to use it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You tape it nicely, and you just return it as it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you throw it away, we don't charge for shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll see what I can do, but like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: when I get my credit card statement,\n\nSpeaker 2: I really don't want to see that charge on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you can just return it, we refund you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem, Mr. Kerry.\n\nSpeaker 1: You get your money back for sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And here's another question.\n\nSpeaker 1: What credit card did you use?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the credit card that I used got hacked and got changed.\n\nSpeaker 1: The numbers got changed, and I didn't give you the numbers.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what credit card did you happen to use?\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever was in the file because, you know, we just use whatever you put in file.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have no way to get any other card that you never use.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, that card has been obsolete for six months now, almost.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe the bank connected them together some way, some more.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, in a system, we just went based on, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you got the activator, you didn't let us know that it wasn't working,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you had a refill schedule five months later.\n\nSpeaker 2: Originally, you had it every 30 days, but that was changed.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it was five months for you to experience the activator\n\nSpeaker 2: and your value and see, you know, that's all it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, just return it.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to refund you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll put it back in here and tape it up, and I'll ship it back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll take it to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: But now you're sure you're going to take that and return it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, just, yeah, you know, you can do your return.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if you're going to have to get another packet\n\nSpeaker 1: because you lost the one we provided.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: When the pharmacy gets it, they update your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: We refund you for that refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm placing notes here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got the package right here with the shipping label from you on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Amazing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, am I going to walk into the post office,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going to say, oh, no, we can't do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have to get that shipping label back.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you have that package, right, that we provided?\n\nSpeaker 1: For you and for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just got it today.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just write on it, refuse return.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all you've got to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can't even leave it in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: When the mailman sees that,\n\nSpeaker 1: he realizes that he did a mistake to bring that to your address,\n\nSpeaker 2: so he sends that back to the source.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's what I'm going to do then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll be getting this back here as soon as the mailman gets to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we're going to refund you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, Mr. Carey.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm canceling the account, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Talk to you later.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
