Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was able to pull your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you have a prescription for 50 mg, 10 tablets of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think, every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So any health concerns, or you just try to stop the 30 days and just order as needed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's actually\n\nSpeaker 2: I probably just put it on hold\n\nSpeaker 1: because I'm not using\n\nSpeaker 2: the 10 every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can hold it for you. I can pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can do 90 days, or if you want longer, that's fine. You can reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you do it on\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you pause it, do I have to call back to\n\nSpeaker 1: So we can do this. How does that work?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's say you pause for 90 days. You get 10 pills in 90 days, for example.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's not going to be every single month moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be every three months, for example.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's an example.\n\nSpeaker 2: Four months, every four months,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can move it back to every 90 days, or\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you can move it back around. Let's say you do 90 days and then you need it every 60 days,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can move back around at your convenience because you have a VIP status,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So 90 days for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: 90 days, yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that way, the good part about it is that you lock your price in when you do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if prices go up, you're still entitled to the same deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: So are you fine with April 3rd?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see, when is it? February?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or the end of April, maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I still have quite a few of the ones\n\nSpeaker 2: that I got in January.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you could probably do March, April,\n\nSpeaker 2: 30, 60, 90.\n\nSpeaker 1: So probably even May.\n\nSpeaker 2: May, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: So one in May, would you like an early May, middle May?\n\nSpeaker 1: Middle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm going to get you on the 15th of May.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I got you on the\n\nSpeaker 2: three-month frequency. Next date is May 15th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you are set. That allows you to lock your price in. Your doctor consultation is still available to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can move back to frequency at your liking anytime too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right, that'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you are set.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Bye-bye. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye. You too.",
