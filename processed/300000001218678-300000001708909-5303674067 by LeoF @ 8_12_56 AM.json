Can I have your first and last name, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Richard.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sikora, S-Y-K-O-R-A.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Sikora. It looks like you were getting 50 pills at a time. Did you want to do that same order again today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're still there at PO Box 622, Forest Hill, California. That's correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a question if I can, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have those little red pills made by Viagra, I think?\n\nSpeaker 1: We do not, unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 2: We are... they aren't, I don't believe those are FDA approved, and we don't sell those as of now. Maybe in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I couldn't say.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, thank you very much. Just thought I'd ask.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have your Visa here, Richard, that ends in 6851. Is that the card you wanted to use today?\n\nSpeaker 1: 6851? No, no, that's not one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I can take a new card number whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: We got scammed and so I got all new cards.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, I believe it. It's a—\n\nSpeaker 2: Visa?\n\nSpeaker 1: Visa, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: 4 4 0 0.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6 6 3 5.\n\nSpeaker 2: 8 0 2 0.\n\nSpeaker 1: 6 6 6 5.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0 6.\n\nSpeaker 1: 3 0. And then the CVV code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1 1 3.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a second. I'm going to process this order for you now. You said 1 1 3?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty, so you're all set, Richard. Your order's been placed. You're going to see that process, ship out, and arrive in the next few days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: How many days approximately?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have that, three to five, I would say.\n\nSpeaker 2: By Friday at the absolute latest?\n\nSpeaker 1: Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Very good. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You betcha. Bye now.",
