And Go-Go Med said they got it, but I haven't seen my refund yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, let's take a look here and see what the holdup or the status is. Can I get the phone number associated with the account?\n\nSpeaker 2: 518-669-9499.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Robert McCaffrey, 11-6-1956.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, so I see here that we received it on the 20th. Go-Go Meds, rather. So that was issued on the 20th, and you might see it any day now, so either later today or tomorrow. But I see the refund was issued.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, I checked my credit card yesterday, I think, or the day before. I don't know, it's been snowing so much here. I'll keep checking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do see it has been issued. Sometimes there can be small delays.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just depends on the credit institution. American Express, I've seen it next day, PayPal is immediate. But depending on the credit institution, it can usually take a little bit of time for it to go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
