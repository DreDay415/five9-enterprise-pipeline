I put in an order today from y'all, and it showed up that I put in two orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: Two charges on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: One's for $67.\n\nSpeaker 2: One is for 29. My name is Earl Bracey.\n\nSpeaker 1: One is for $29.40, and the other one is for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Earl. I just need your phone number that's associated with the prescription, and it's not this one that you called in on, so it would be another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: You need my phone number. Okay, it's 252-366-5476.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let's see about you. And you're born on – what's your date of birth? Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: 18-10-54.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Okay, great. So you're located at 184 Cottonwood Road, Nashville, North Carolina, 27856.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the original order you placed for 10 pills was $63.95, and then a screen popped up, and it said, hey, today and only today, with y'all's first orders, we offer you guys this deal one time and one time only.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to double the order for 50% off?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to add 10 more pills for $29.40? And you clicked on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the total for your order should be 20 pills, and you should have two charges.\n\nSpeaker 1: One is the full price for the original 10-pill prescription, and then the add-on was a 50% off offer to get 10 more pills for $29.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so one of them was 10 pills for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95. That's the full price, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel the $29 one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, let me see. Give me just one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Requested to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so $29.40.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've processed that refund and canceled that upgrade.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, you should see that refund for those extra 10 pills as soon as possible, but it really depends on your bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unfortunately, it could take a few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I just processed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
