I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you please confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-25-40.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I have your profile pulled up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you still at 12523 Weldstone Drive?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yes. Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the cost of that?\n\nSpeaker 1: How many pills are there in our order?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. So right now we have a quantity of 40 for $149.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we have a quantity of 25 for $99 and a quantity of 10 for $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. What's the difference between the regular 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is Pfizer's latest formula of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's the inactive ingredients in the latest formula that makes it work faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: People are saying they feel it take in about 11 to 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the bottle it will say take one hour prior to get the full result.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it lasts longer. It lasts for 14 hours in your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: And people are reporting less side effects, especially less headaches.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, send me the one with, I said 20?\n\nSpeaker 2: 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 25. I'm going to try that out, see how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now I'm ready for your credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do I have one on file?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, is that the Visa ending in 1556?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let me check that number again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my Visa card, 1556. Hold on a second, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to put one on now?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I had some credit cards redone. Yeah, that's the correct number.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect. That went through, so they'll be shipping out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
