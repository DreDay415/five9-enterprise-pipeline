    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Jimmy. I sent a couple bottles back and want to find out how long does it take to get the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a tracking number that says you guys received it yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me take a look and I can help you out with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at the phone number. Let me try one more time. I think I might have had the wrong digit in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: 530...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, last time they couldn't find it either.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear with me one second. Let me see what I can come up with.\n\nSpeaker 2: That time it was my mistake with the digit.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, do you have another number then that you gave them other than when you called it from?\n\nSpeaker 2: I gave it to them last time. It didn't work either, but it's 530-541-5596.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, nothing comes up under that one either.\n\nSpeaker 2: How did they find it? What did they do last time to find it for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think they looked it up by my name. My birth date, 89701.\n\nSpeaker 2: 89701. And what's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Frank Giardina.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Frank. I got you here. Okay. I don't know why they have a number of 530-545-0094.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the number that I'm seeing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that there was a credit issue on your account, so it's probably going to be a couple of days before you see it in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Both of those are refunded. You had two 6395s refunded back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should be getting that back on your card any day now because I see it was there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to go to them. Let me see what card it's going to go to so you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it end with a 9427?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but I'll tell you right now, I have to go to a different screen for that. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have it off. The number's not running. Yes, it is still.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm seeing it on my bank card. I'm looking back to the 23rd here, but you guys didn't get it until yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we got it yesterday. It's going to take about at least two to three days before you see it, if that's the case,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they've got to upgrade it. But I do see that it was credited back on the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was actually refunded today. I see it was refunded today on the 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so you should see that it was for November and January orders,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you should see that on your card within the next two to three days. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I'll keep an eye out for it. Thanks, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye.",
