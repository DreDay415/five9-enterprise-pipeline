I'm holding your prescription, Mr. McQueen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm actually calling to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Mr. McQueen, I see that you just got a replacement and your account was paused for five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't want to keep it paused so you can reorder?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because I'm having a hard time with the medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not working great for one and for two.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have really bad side effects on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the last time I called, they sent me a different stuff, I guess, and it was the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have the same symptoms, so I'm going to have to cut back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that the first time taking Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it actually was.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was taking Cialis before, then I started taking the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: The Cialis does the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get very bad indigestion and I get very bad sinus problems.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, usually either Cialis will work or Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm surprised that you say both are doing that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe some you want to look into a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 2: One of them should be okay, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cialis, you can microdose.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were taking, what, 20 milligrams Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was taking 10 for a long time, and then I was taking 20 on occasion whenever I needed it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I tried something different than Cialis, which that's why I went to the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're both not working for me right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to have to hold off until I can figure something else out because it's too much I can't even take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: As much as I want to take it, I can't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If both are not in good health, there's not much I can say.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would have recommended to microdose them so the body gets used to them.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're sure that you want to just be completely off, I'm going to cancel the account.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only thing is, you know, something's changed for the better in the future, which I wish for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Price will be different.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why they offer to pause so they don't have to pay a new doctor consultation.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when I cancel, I got to cancel that one they finance for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's okay for right now because I don't know if I'll be getting back on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you guys come up with something in the future, you know, and I'll look into it.\n\nSpeaker 1: If something comes out where I don't have those side effects, I'll probably give you guys a call again.\n\nSpeaker 2: But right now, I'm going to just cancel it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: I canceled everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's your say, Mr. Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
