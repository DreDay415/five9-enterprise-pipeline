    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you? Yes, I have an order in and I didn't get what I was—\n\nSpeaker 2: Supposed to get and a new order was sent out and it came back generic, not what was advertised.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have my prescription number here at 9968. It's okay John, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2446. Thank you so much, it's your VIP status customer. Okay, it looks like they sent you the—\n\nSpeaker 1: generics and then they sent you the AGV. So the way you can confirm you received the AGV—\n\nSpeaker 2: is on the bottle, it's going to say Greenstone LLC. Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer—\n\nSpeaker 1: in France, and then on the pills the only number imprinted is the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: For the milligrams because your previous, your previous bottle is going to say APCO—\n\nSpeaker 1: and then on those pills the letters AC is imprinted on your first bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: What about this bottle? What about the bottle I have? So on the, yeah, on the pill the only number—\n\nSpeaker 1: imprinted is going to be the number 100. And there's only 10, there's 10 pills in this bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: They only sent you—why do they only send you 10? I will send you the other 10, you paid for 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know but I was supposed to have two additional—\n\nSpeaker 2: orders for additional. One of my initial order was for more than 15. So right now I have 10—\n\nSpeaker 1: they're diamond shaped and they have 100 on them, that's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, okay, that is the correct AGV. Give me a second, I'm going to get you out those other 10. I don't know why they didn't—\n\nSpeaker 1: send you your complete order, that's stupid. Well, I'm going to know if there's a recurring—\n\nSpeaker 2: order that's going in because I don't want—I went on the website to a better business—\n\nSpeaker 1: viewer and it seems like there's a number of complaints similar to mine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh well, okay, so it—\n\nSpeaker 1: does put you on monthly refills but you do not have to have monthly refills now that you have—\n\nSpeaker 2: VIP status. What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause their refills for six—\n\nSpeaker 1: months, that way it keeps your profile open with the doctor and keeps your prescription active—\n\nSpeaker 2: and allows you to call in whenever you need a refill. I want to know how much is in charge—\n\nSpeaker 1: and I want what charge is it on my American Express card? Let me see. How is it being paid?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you used an American Express ending in 3016.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just double check that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, take your time. American Express 3016.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when is the next—how many have I been shipped because I only received—\n\nSpeaker 2: one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you were only shipped the one you bought and they sent you the incorrect—\n\nSpeaker 2: medication, so they sent you a replacement of only 10 for free and then I just put in another—\n\nSpeaker 1: order for, you know, the other 10 that you paid for for free, so they'll be shipping that out to you—\n\nSpeaker 2: today. And then what we can do is I can go ahead and pause your refills for six months. I can pause—\n\nSpeaker 1: you until July 31st of 2026, that way it keeps you locked in at your price point and just allows—\n\nSpeaker 2: you to call in whenever you need a refill and if you don't need one by then you can call us and we—\n\nSpeaker 1: can pause it further and that way you just—that guarantees that your rates won't go up because—\n\nSpeaker 2: I heard prices are going to go up in the next few months but once you're locked in they will never—\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, rates will stay the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, how many—how many—how much is charged on my account—\n\nSpeaker 1: from your company? Okay, let's see, your first order you bought a quantity of 10 for $63.95—\n\nSpeaker 2: and then you upgraded and added an additional 10 pills for $29.40 and then you upgraded and—\n\nSpeaker 1: added the testosterone, three bottles for $79.95, so you've only been charged for your first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the three bottles you're talking about are the other supplements?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the supplements that you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was the amount on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That was $79.95, so there's three separate transactions—\n\nSpeaker 2: one for $79.95, the 10 pill upgrade for $29.40, and the original order of 10 pills for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're going to correct that, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I'm sending you out the other 10 today—\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I went ahead and paused your refills for six months until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem John, I'm sorry they only sent you 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to be mailing you the rest today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye.",
