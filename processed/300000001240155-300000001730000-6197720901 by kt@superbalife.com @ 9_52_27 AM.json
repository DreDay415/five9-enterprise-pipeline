    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Theodore, this is K.T. Gitterich with PfizerScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to use your telephone number to pull up your account, that's 619.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to read off your chart, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to help you with this, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I missed you guys over there. You're in San Diego, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: I moved to Danville.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I was.\n\nSpeaker 1: You were?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see, you're in Indiana. Why would you do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why would you move to Indiana?\n\nSpeaker 2: I escaped. California was going crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know. The tax, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm single and I get like 35% to 38% tax, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. They're chasing everybody out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, man. You know, we need a new governor.\n\nSpeaker 1: We need to go back to a red state, man, not a blue, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take care of you, bud, and I'm so sorry to see you go.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what I see here is, correct me if I'm wrong,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I can help people to stop this or set you apart, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing I see, Theodore,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that you do hold a VIP status that Dr. Matthew Ruppel,\n\nSpeaker 2: one of our Pfizer doctors, set up.\n\nSpeaker 1: He wrote you a script for the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was four 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: He ordered 40 in January.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I don't see it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess you spoke to Summer and then she did a replacement, right,\n\nSpeaker 2: of 10 pills and all that of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: How did those work out for you, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I haven't received the AGV yet, and that was part of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: When the first one showed up, it just says generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when I consulted or did the questionnaire with the doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: I told him I've had that prescription before and it didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I was going for the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they gave me that prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: At least that's what it shows up on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so do me a favor, bud, and I'll make it right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm glad that you're calling in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pull out the new bottle that Summer – not the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the bottle you pull out that Summer sent you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take out the pill, and I'll show you the difference of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll make you pull by –\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm on the road right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was just calling to kind of settle it off.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so just remember my extension is 0037, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then call me back, but this is what –\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you 30 more because she only sent you 10,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, you're supposed to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you get these pills, they're going to look the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: The bottle – what we've been finding is the pharmacy is keeping things in the pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: the same bottle, and we don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've got to kind of go crack our whip over there, and it's in Kentucky, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're in Indiana.\n\nSpeaker 2: But here's the thing is when you take out the damn pill, Theodore,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's going to look the same as the ones you got before,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the difference is you can cross-compare it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The ones you got before says AC339 or AC340, and that's the basic variable.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pfizer makes the AGV, which is also – it looks the same,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the etching is 5-0, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So she sent you the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: The bottle looks the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the disparity.\n\nSpeaker 1: But in light of this, what I'll do is I'll pause everything\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll put a stop to the monthly refills and all that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then I'll send you another 30 more to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when you give me the thumbs-up in a few months or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: just keep in touch with me, and then we'll decide there how you want to go about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's make sure they work first.\n\nSpeaker 2: And let's make sure we make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it makes more sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: So be on the lookout on Monday or Tuesday, the same kind of package,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you'll get 30, all right, bud, to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when you look at the etching – go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I was going to say, and the other thing was with summer,\n\nSpeaker 2: I saw the order in there, but it was in the pharmacy forever.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just showed that it was like – it seemed like maybe it just didn't update.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hadn't seen them.\n\nSpeaker 2: They hadn't arrived.\n\nSpeaker 1: They might be in the mail now, but I hadn't gotten to attend.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so, yeah, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're moving at the facility.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's in the network in Indianapolis right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you should get it by tomorrow, not before 9 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what it says.\n\nSpeaker 1: So USPS is trying to over-promise and under-deliver now, like Amazon,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they're still trying to work out their kinks.\n\nSpeaker 1: But how you do all this is – and I'll run advice.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can kind of look at it on your phone, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go to scoreblue.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Log in with your Yahoo, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: When you log in with your Yahoo,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to click the three little lines on the top right of the screen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Click that, and you're going to see a category pop up that says Your Prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: In there I'm putting two buttons, one that says Quick Refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in the future if you decide, right, after we give this a go,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the second thing is there's a track button that says Track.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can click that button, and it will show you exactly where your product is at.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like it may – yeah, because right now it's saying it's arriving tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it'll be there tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm so sorry about that snafu, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, and then the other part when I'm – and, again, it could just be a typo,\n\nSpeaker 1: that type of thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the first order and the subsequent 10, they both say Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's no mention of AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's where people get confused.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we used to put AGV on them and make them blue,\n\nSpeaker 2: but the pharmacies would get them confused with the original $100 Viagra and blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we took out the dye.\n\nSpeaker 2: And because we make three tiers of 25, 50, and 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: we only put the marking of the milligrams on it for the pharmacist.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way it's more – it's easier.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's where they get confused between the basic Viagra and the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you pull out the 10 that you're getting this tomorrow, right,\n\nSpeaker 2: you'll see the etching is going to say 5-0 on the actual pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry about the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then be on the lookout.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you another 30 more that make you whole so it's pill for pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: dollar for dollar.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll put everything on pause until you figure it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And call me if you have any qualms and all that,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll take care of you either way.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said it was a zero.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 0-0-3-7.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Think of killer Theodore.\n\nSpeaker 2: KT.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it does work with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we got everything on hold until you give us a thumbs up and all that,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll make sure I get you that other 30.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's how we roll, bro.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bud, we're Diegans.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're Padres, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, hey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if you know, Fort Wayne, where I'm at,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's where the farm club's at.\n\nSpeaker 1: No way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pull up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to use your address, if you don't mind,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll Google it so I can look around because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: when I was a kid, when my parents died,\n\nSpeaker 2: my uncle was in Indiana for a long time, maybe 20 years.\n\nSpeaker 1: He was trying to get me to go over there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And now I hear people are going to Indiana and Fort Wayne,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going down to Arizona, you know, Maricopa, Austin, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know?\n\nSpeaker 1: For me, I got to go where there's good jiu-jitsu, one,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then there's water because I free dive, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: But I'll look it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll look it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't know about the jiu-jitsu in Indiana,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I do know about the wrestlers there.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're kicked ass.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll look into it, but, you know, as long as there's wrestlers in jiu-jitsu,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll be happy, dude.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be happy to go there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know about jiu-jitsu, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, there's a couple more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like my one buddy, he's been doing like black belt karate.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, there's a couple of mixed martial arts,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I don't know the quality of the MMA side of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll look into it because I've been in the game for quite some time,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'm not trying to – you know, I want to just keep movement.\n\nSpeaker 2: For me, it's all about movement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And as men, you know, like we need action, bro.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not designed to be behind a damn desk, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm already doing this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or sitting in a truck.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm doing too.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sitting in a truck all day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you got to get up and move those hips.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Move that upper back and stretch out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, even just running, bro, you don't be primitive again, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I know you're growing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And be safe out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I pray that these people that would be mindful if you're in that truck\n\nSpeaker 1: because all it takes is for them to be an idiot just for one second,\n\nSpeaker 2: a split second, and you would change your life, Theodore.\n\nSpeaker 1: You would change your life forever.\n\nSpeaker 2: My nephew was doing that for 10 years, and he goes, Uncle KT, man,\n\nSpeaker 1: let me tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: People don't know how dangerous it is when they're just kind of zigging\n\nSpeaker 1: and zagging on the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I got like 10 tons, you know, or 20 tons.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't stop on a dime.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can't.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you got what, 13 or 16 gears?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, most of them are switching to automatic, but still, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 1: The brakes, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Most of them are automatic now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're like, I can't stand on the brakes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it takes you a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, man, may God be with you forever, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, your safety and security is everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, KT.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, hey, just know because you're – hey, check this out, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Theodore, when you're traveling and you're – because you got like a microwave in\n\nSpeaker 2: there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I used to have clients that have a truck, and they have like a quarter of a\n\nSpeaker 2: million-dollar truck sometimes, and they got microwaves, they got TVs in there,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, the big ones, right, the rigs.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they're on the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can update on the platform your shipping address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's say if you just get a motel for one night, right, you click that damn\n\nSpeaker 1: button, we can send you the pills there just in case you run out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just food for thought.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, fortunately – yeah, fortunately for me, I ended up – I was over the\n\nSpeaker 2: road when I started because I switched occupations.\n\nSpeaker 1: The reason I was even out in San Diego, I'm from Pennsylvania.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was out there for a long time, but I was in the Navy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for your service, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and then I switched uniforms for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was working, you know, federal law enforcement, and then I was like, I'm going\n\nSpeaker 2: to drive a truck.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was OTR.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I'm just in a day cab, so I just – I'm home every night.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's a beautiful thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, bud, I'm glad that you're home.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you're 100% service-connected, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for your service.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm 18, bravo.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did eight years at Afghan, so God bless you, bud, and, you know, thank you for\n\nSpeaker 2: your service.\n\nSpeaker 1: And also in law enforcement, my brother's a federal marshal, so you guys seen\n\nSpeaker 2: some shit, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys seen some –\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, well –\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys seen some gnarly stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the one I was involved in – yeah, the one I was involved in, they're\n\nSpeaker 1: getting a lot of shit right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Damn, I know, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you know when they froze the pay a couple months – like last month, my\n\nSpeaker 2: friend and my brother, they weren't getting paid for a few months, how they\n\nSpeaker 1: held the pay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he was like, damn, man, damn.\n\nSpeaker 1: And actually, you know, Trump pushed it through, thank God, and he got paid,\n\nSpeaker 2: dude.\n\nSpeaker 1: He finally got paid, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I hope you get your pay, man, and sit back with your brewskis and enjoy,\n\nSpeaker 1: man, enjoy life.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've done it all, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you bet, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for your service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep in touch with me, Theodore, and be on the lookout for the other\n\nSpeaker 1: batch that I'm sending, inclusive of what you're getting now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, I'll check out that one tomorrow, see how that works as well,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, kind of –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do a dry run.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you can do a dry run, that would be good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just don't take away any oily food or any tomahawk, stuff like that, because\n\nSpeaker 1: it's all about the activation and the absorption.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the key there, is that formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't cross hairs with anything like that, and you'll see it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll see light in your eyes again.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll be like an AR-15, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gun for hire.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gun for hire.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ready to roll.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ready to roll.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, over and out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
