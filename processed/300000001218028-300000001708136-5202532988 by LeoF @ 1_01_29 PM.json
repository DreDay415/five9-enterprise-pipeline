    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Jerome Heller. I want to make a purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, was it your first time calling us or anything like that, or had you been on the website before?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I've been doing this for, since I found you, about six months ago or so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, perfect, perfect. Mr. Heller, were you at 1026 South 3rd Avenue, Stafford?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's me, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect. And did you want to do the same order as previously, the 40 pills, 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem at all. We've already confirmed your address, AZ 85546.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have a card here on file. Give me just a second. It looks like it ends, it's a Visa, that ends in 2122.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the card you wanted to use today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's a new phone. When I first started with you guys, I had a different phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries, no worries. But you wanted me to use that same card we have on file for the charge?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I guess it was this one. I used this one the last time I ordered, yeah, and that's where you got it on chart now, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I mean the Visa card we have on file. That's the card you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, the Visa card, because my phone part of it ends in 2122. Say again, then. I got it straight this time. Say again.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a Visa that ended in 2122. Is that the card you wanted to use for payment?\n\nSpeaker 2: Wait a minute. Let me get my card. No, it doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries, take your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: The number doesn't sound right. Let me just see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. So I'll charge the card to you in just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, there was another thing too.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries, so it did go through there. So you're all set, Mr. Henson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I guess so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'll charge the card to you in just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'll charge the card to you in just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: About a year ago, I had to change cards, so that number is still not used to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries, so it did go through there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set, Mr. Heller. You're going to see that order process and ship out and arrive in the next few business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, I appreciate that then. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day. Bye-bye now.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too, bye.",
