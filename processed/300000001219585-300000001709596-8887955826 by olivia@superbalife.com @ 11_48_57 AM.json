    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Thyacra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Mike Price.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Mike. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Thank you for asking. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I just want to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the phone number that's going to be associated with your prescription, Michael?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty. There you are, Mike. And what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Amazing. Great. And you're located at 3700 Painville Road, Brandenburg, Kentucky, 401-08?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Yeah, so I can see your prescription here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, Mike. Well, just so you know, you don't have to receive regular prescription refills if you don't want to with your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we didn't refill it, and the way that would work is if you did want to order before the end of July, you could.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself whenever you are ready before then.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I've got some already that I didn't think I was supposed to get unless I called up.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I said, I just don't need it. And I might be lucky if I call back every six months. So I just didn't cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah. So the pills, they don't work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't really need them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Alright, well the last part of my job, and maybe this applies to you and maybe it doesn't,\n\nSpeaker 2: is to let you know that you do technically qualify if you are interested and your current script isn't working for you\n\nSpeaker 1: for a free sample of our newest highest quality Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff, and it looks like you haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is a superior prescription to your current one. It comes directly from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And although it's the fastest acting, longest lasting stuff we've made, my favorite thing about it is that we've\n\nSpeaker 1: specifically formulated it to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way it would work is the free sample is 10 pills, and it comes with kind of like a six month free trial\n\nSpeaker 1: where I would send you out the 10 pills. And that free sample would begin a prescription that would be placed on hold\n\nSpeaker 2: for you until July while you try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe that you would, and we believe based off of the reviews of the products and the data that you'd give us\n\nSpeaker 2: a call in two to five months to order some, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would do that, because yeah, I've got a headache, I'll feed you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah. Okay, great. Alrighty, so I'm going to send you 50 milligrams because that's what you've already been\n\nSpeaker 1: approved for. Can I ship these to 3700 Painesville Road, Brandenburg, Kentucky, 40108?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can. I'm in Florida for two months, but I've got a guy staying there for me, so there's no problem there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so he'll just receive them there. Alright, so yeah, that'll be 10 free pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just sent them. They'll probably get to you by, usually, you know, I'd say the next three days,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that snow, that ice storm is wild, so I don't know, probably within the week.\n\nSpeaker 2: It don't matter. I've got two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so if you need anything before July of this year,\n\nSpeaker 2: just give us a call at this phone number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just a reminder, Mike, you want to make sure to take the pills on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's going to be really important. And then you want to avoid alcohol and caffeine the day you take them,\n\nSpeaker 1: just because alcohol and caffeine restrict blood flow, and you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I drink coffee every morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, that's fine. That's not a big a deal, but you know what I mean. It's not in excess.\n\nSpeaker 2: I only got one beer last time, and I started getting a little headache.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I do have Cialis, and that works really good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's good. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought I was getting something newer when I ordered these, actually, when I seen it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought it was the new prescription and better.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I just got the, like, 50 milligrams instead of the 100s.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so the prescription number we have for you, that's for air.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it is still FDA approved and third-party tested.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is still Real Viagra, but it's for air American stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do think you definitely are going to find that the stuff I just sent you is a superior prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: because it is air newer stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll try it when I get back, and I'll let you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Mike.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
