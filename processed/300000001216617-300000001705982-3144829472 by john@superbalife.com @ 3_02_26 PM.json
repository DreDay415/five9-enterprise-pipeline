    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Uday. I need a receipt of my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem at all, sir. Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: I used to have a different zip code. Now I get a new zip code. It's 63128.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Becker Place Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can get a refill for you. Sorry. I thought I was about to sneeze there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Same exact thing as last time on the same card?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I have a different address and different card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, it's not Becker Place Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's Becker Place Drive. Before it's Illinois.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see that it used to be Illinois, but the current address we have is St. Louis. That's correct, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You got 30 pills. Is that what you're looking to do again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I get AGV or just a regular?\n\nSpeaker 2: You got the AGV the last time. Your last order was AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, really?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. The one from August.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll get the same one then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it the MasterCard that ends in 2297?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, a different card. Let me give you a new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm ready when you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: 52133311838213161.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0129.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 827.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want to repeat the card number again?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it didn't go through yet, but I got it validated. It's good. I just updated it on our side, and then I'm going to get your order through here.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've actually changed the package. It's the same price, but you're going to get 40 pills. I don't know. I don't remember us doing 30.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We're all set, sir. You're good to go. This will ship out on Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the total on that?\n\nSpeaker 1: 163.95. That's what your price has been for the last two orders now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
