    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Ascor Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, good morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Name is George Langdon.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, George, what's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 11-18-45.\n\nSpeaker 1: And George, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to turn off my automatic renewal.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so I see here that the doctor\n\nSpeaker 1: wrote your prescription for the 100 milligram Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, so yeah, George, you're not required\n\nSpeaker 1: to get this monthly at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, I can put this on a pause,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you can call in and place orders as needed\n\nSpeaker 2: for the remaining refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you had an opportunity to try the AGV yet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I did try it, and I don't know\n\nSpeaker 2: whether I needed to give it more time or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it wasn't all that effective in the time frame\n\nSpeaker 2: that I had.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm hoping I have more opportunity\n\nSpeaker 2: to play around with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just some recommendations I always like to tell patients,\n\nSpeaker 1: man to man, make sure you try to take it on an empty stomach\n\nSpeaker 2: if possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Plenty of water is great, and try\n\nSpeaker 2: to avoid generally fatty foods in the diet, OK?\n\nSpeaker 1: Standard Thiagara recommendations,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I know that, but unless you're going solo,\n\nSpeaker 1: going on an empty stomach is probably a low probability.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I've taken it before, dates before,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then as long as you take it on the empty stomach,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then say you eat an hour or so afterwards,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's already being broken down in your system at that point,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it stays in your system for about 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can always go ahead and do that as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, so you know, the last time\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried it, the first time I tried it so far,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that I took it probably an hour and a half, two hours,\n\nSpeaker 2: before activity, but after dinner.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my stomach was not empty.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's a biggie.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is a biggie right there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So try taking it on an empty stomach,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you'll see different results for sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whenever I've ever had the opportunity to take it on\n\nSpeaker 1: an empty stomach, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're saying take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: So for example, if I have dinner at 6 o'clock,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I take it at 5 o'clock, then it's\n\nSpeaker 1: going to work at 11 o'clock?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh yeah, sorry, it will stay in your system for 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is, is in the claims.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, you're talking it's hanging in for 14 hours\n\nSpeaker 1: and being attracted in 15 minutes, it ain't happening.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you need to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's as prescribed.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it will kick in fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just need to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: Taking it with food in your stomach\n\nSpeaker 1: doesn't allow the medication to be absorbed as fast as it\n\nSpeaker 2: could, because there's stuff in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't get into your liver or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the big thing with any type of ED medication,\n\nSpeaker 1: and this is across the board with Cialis, Viagra, anything,\n\nSpeaker 2: is taking it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then wait for the kick in later.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, because like I said, you\n\nSpeaker 2: could take it the night before you have dinner,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you'll feel it in the morning still.\n\nSpeaker 2: It stays in your system for that long.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I've had a lot of that experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: She wants to stay at nighttime, and then in the morning,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's funnier than at night.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, hey, that happens.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set, though, George.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and made those adjustments.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye-bye.",
