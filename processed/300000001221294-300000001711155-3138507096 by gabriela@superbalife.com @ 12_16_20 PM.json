I guess the simple part is I'm just trying to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I've gotten those from you guys before, and I'm all out,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I guess I'm just trying to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, first name Gregory, D-R-E-G-O-R-Y, last name Lynch, L-Y-N-C-H.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what was the other thing you wanted? I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your date of birth, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, October 9th, 1973.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Okay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it looks like last time you purchased Cialis, 20 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that the same order you're trying to place today, 24 pills of Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then, Gregory, is your shipping address still the same,\n\nSpeaker 2: West 12 Mile Road, Apartment 204, Southfield, Michigan, 48034?\n\nSpeaker 1: That is all correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. And can I charge the visa ending in 3729?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What would be the new card number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on. Let me get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is the price again on this?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're getting 24 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, the price, the price, the price.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it would be 24 pills of Cialis, 20 milligrams for 159.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay. That sounds about right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What is the card number?\n\nSpeaker 2: The new card number is, I think it starts the same as the old one,\n\nSpeaker 1: 5-027-0971, 7294.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration date?\n\nSpeaker 1: January 31st, January 20th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say it again, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the CDB number?\n\nSpeaker 2: 699.\n\nSpeaker 1: 699.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. You're all set, Gregory.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was able to successfully place in that order for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And I forget.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that come in regular mail or is it like?\n\nSpeaker 1: Regular mail, yes, USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And do I get a tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, as soon as this ships out,\n\nSpeaker 2: you should be receiving a tracking number sent to your e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What e-mail address do you have for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: What was that?\n\nSpeaker 1: The e-mail address that you're using? What is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the e-mail address is lynch50 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: It should be glynch50 at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what we have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.
