No, well, I'm in Florida right now through the end of March, so if you send it now and again in March, I probably need it sent to a different address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So did you want to get one now or did you want to just set a date out for the next one to get shipped?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I need it now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so we need to update the address then.
