I was able to get that pulled up with the information that I'm calling from.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and try to take care of your request for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you're getting the Viagra, the 100 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like that's your prescription, how you're getting 10 every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that too frequently for you, or is it particularly why you want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't need them. I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, not a problem. Let me go ahead and take care of your request.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, David, what I was able to go ahead and do for you, I was able to stop those monthly shipments. I also stopped the monthly refills that was included with your prescription, and I stopped the monthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you did just recently have one shipped out to you just on the 12th, it looks like, too, as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me ask you, how were the refills working for you when you were using them?\n\nSpeaker 2: They were fine. I just don't need them anymore. I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but I have one of the latest ones that's already shipped out, but I made sure going forward you won't get any more sent out to you as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
