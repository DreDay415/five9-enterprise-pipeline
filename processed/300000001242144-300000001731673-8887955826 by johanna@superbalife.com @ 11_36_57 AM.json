    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, this is Warren Combs. I need to cancel a prescription that I have with you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can I get your phone number, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's 573-732-3069.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Combs, I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I do see that you are a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just so you know that as our customer, we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to get monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can actually modify the frequency of your orders and set it up however you would like\n\nSpeaker 2: or also put a pause on your account at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want me to remove the monthly recurring refills and set it up differently?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, here's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: What these pills are supposed to do, they're doing absolutely nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only thing they've done is put me to sleep.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if somebody put the wrong pills in there or what, but that's sure not what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, do you have them in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Would you be able to confirm what it says on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 2: On the top?\n\nSpeaker 1: On the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, on the tablet. Okay, hang on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me get it out here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm just completely shocked.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't order sleeping pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry that that happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me make sure the pharmacy sent you the correct one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I know things can happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they refilled them, so I'm stuck here with, like, I've got 15.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've tried these things five times and they do nothing but put me night and night.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, it sounds like you did not get the ATV.\n\nSpeaker 2: So as soon as you confirm that, what I can do is I can send you a replacement order for both of those orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you able to see what it says on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think it looks like it says AG340.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC? Okay, yeah, that is the generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are FDA-approved generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're not the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Looks like the pharmacy sent you the incorrect one, so I will send you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got two orders of 10, but the total is 20.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 25 just for the inconvenience.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to throw in an additional five in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: The AGV is the new and improved version.\n\nSpeaker 1: So although it is still Sildenafil, Sildenafil is the active ingredient in Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the inactive ingredient in the new AGV, which they've altered and improved.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to say 100 on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will also say Greenstone and AGV on the actual prescription label.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll message the pharmacy now and get you a replacement sent out today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, is that no charge?\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, yes, no charge because it's replacing the order that you sent out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, then I'm willing to try it again, but it's for once before.\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't had that kind of experience with anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I do apologize for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure if you're aware of this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe you are, but also just keep in mind, as a suggestion,\n\nSpeaker 1: for all Viagra to take it on an empty stomach for the best result.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm aware of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I've had several other pills that I've tried.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was hoping this one would work, but not having much luck with the pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you've got shots and then those, well, I'm not even going to speak of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: They work, but the after effects are way too intense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, you can't do away with those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: And here's the good news.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, the bad news isn't about the wrong thing and they didn't work,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the good news is that the AGV for most of our clients who do not get results\n\nSpeaker 2: with the generic Viagra, the new AGV, the way it's been modified, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: primarily with a delivery mechanism, they're really happy with the results.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm confident that you're going to be happy with it as well,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you should be getting them sometime next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll be fine then.\n\nSpeaker 2: It'll get worked out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, sir, for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can't wait for you to try out the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great rest of your day and a wonderful weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
