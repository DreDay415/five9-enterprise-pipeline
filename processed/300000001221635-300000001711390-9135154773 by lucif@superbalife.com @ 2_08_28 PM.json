I understand that you said that the pills weren't working for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Well, you know, if that is the case, there's a few options.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, one, we can always try to send you something else different for free and see if that is agreeing with you a lot better.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, stop sending you this one, clearly.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, but you basically have Viagra and Cialis, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, so we have multiple Viagras and then we have Cialis as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, but I've tried Viagra and Cialis and then both generic as well, and they all do about the same.\n\nSpeaker 2: They all do about the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and you're talking about from us or different companies?\n\nSpeaker 2: Different companies. I mean, the Viagra...\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it wouldn't be the same that you're getting from us.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, most companies get their stuff from China and India, and we actually receive our stuff from either America or France.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, these are actually through my doctors. These are actually through the doctors.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so the stuff that doctors have that they sell for cheap, they're getting from India and China.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's where they're manufactured, which is why they sell them for so cheap,\n\nSpeaker 2: because those countries have very low regulations on their medications.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unlike, you know, France is actually where Viagra was created originally in the 80s,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then America, obviously, we have the FDA, you know, regulatory systems that actually regulate our medicine,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is why it does cost a little bit more, but it is the safest options.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, so, I mean, if you did try other ones, like I said, I can offer to send you one of our newest Viagras\n\nSpeaker 1: that we have from France for free, and we are actually the only sellers of what I'm offering you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it's not something that you can get from anywhere else.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're interested, if not, then, you know, we'll just go ahead and take care of it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, well, I'll try it if it's for free and see if it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, all I ask is that you kind of give me my name and extension here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And ask that you give me a call back once you try it, let me know that it is working better,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, we could pick back up from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, so the name is going to be Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you have tried taking two of them at once, too, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm taking one and then taking another.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is safe to take two at once.\n\nSpeaker 2: You do have the 50 milligrams, so you can't go over 100 in a day, but it would be okay to take two.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have taken them within the day, but, like I said, I can't go over 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: Try two at one time, correct, because you'll get more of a concentrated dosage that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, I got you set up there, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, give me a call when you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
