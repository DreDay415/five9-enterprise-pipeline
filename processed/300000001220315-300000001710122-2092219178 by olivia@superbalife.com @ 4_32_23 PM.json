This is Dan.\n\nSpeaker 1: How are you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, Dan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much for asking. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm so glad to hear that. How can I help you today, Dan?\n\nSpeaker 2: Olivia, I ordered about 10 days ago the new AGV Viagra, but I received only the generic 100 milligrams of Cinephil. I didn't get the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can look into that for you. Okay, Dan, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 3-31-1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you're located at 1681 Spring Court, Tracy, California, 95376?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I do see you here. So you're right. Your prescription, you should have received the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I will send you out a replacement, obviously on us, since you've already paid for it, of the 100 milligrams Cinephils of the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can ship them to 1681 Spring Court, Tracy, California?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, you should receive these within the next three to six business days pending, you know, that crazy storm. The way that you'll know they're the AGV is the pills themselves, they will still be white, but they'll say 1-0-0. And then on the side of the bottle it should say AGV and it should also say Greenstone because that's the manufacturer for the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they will, if I reorder, if they work and I reorder them, they'll send me the AGV instead of the other ones again?\n\nSpeaker 1: You can fix that for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, your prescription moving forward, I moved everything over to the AGV so the old one is canceled out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Daniel, well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you need, oh, also, reminder, make sure to take these on an empty stomach, that's very important.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you also want to avoid alcohol and caffeine when you take them just because caffeine and alcohol restrict blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you want more, not less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't know that about caffeine, actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's really not as bad with caffeine.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just something I do mention because it is technically true about both.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's worse with alcohol.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, yeah, that is a fun fact about caffeine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your help, Olivia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Daniel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
