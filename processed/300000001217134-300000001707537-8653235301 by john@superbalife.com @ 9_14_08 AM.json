What can I do for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was actually calling because I've noticed that another payment was taken out for the subscription,\n\nSpeaker 1: which I've emailed and asked for it to be canceled before, and apparently it wasn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I need to make sure that it gets canceled out because I don't need it no longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I get your zip code, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Zip code? I don't remember what I had listed on there. I think it's 37331.\n\nSpeaker 1: How about your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-22-1985.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see your email, sir. We replied to you telling you you had to call, so that's why it wasn't done.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can take care of it now. We'll close out the account for good, though. That's what you want?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Will it continue because it's in the pharmacy process?\n\nSpeaker 2: Will it still cancel it out and be refunded?\n\nSpeaker 1: That one I have to check on.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can still get your money back on the one that's at the pharmacy, even if it's shipped.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just would have to return it when it gets to you, but I can cancel the future order, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll check with the pharmacy on the other one, and I can let you know once I get a word back from them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we'll do it this way. We'll let this one go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just need to make sure that the address was updated when I did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have 301 First Street.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll go ahead and have this one sent out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just have it for future references, but from here on, I'll just have it canceled out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Kyle. Then we're all set. We're squared away on our side.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
