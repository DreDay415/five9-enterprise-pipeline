It looks like you have transferred over to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your phone number that your account is under, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. My phone number is 801-661-2327.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Rafael Tronco.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Rafael. Let me see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I was able to pull you up, Rafael. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that you're getting the Viagra, the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you're getting 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription had them coming to you every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and try to take care of your request, please,\n\nSpeaker 1: and see what I can do to help you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Rafael. Thank you for waiting for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was able to stop that monthly shipment,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I also stopped the monthly refills that was included with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I also stopped those monthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I did notice that you were VIP with this,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you were getting the Viagra 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it looks like your prescription had you getting them 10 every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Was that too frequently for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: or why did you want to cancel if you don't mind me asking?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. The reason that I need to cancel it is because I still have two bottles.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not using it very often, but I will order again when I need it,\n\nSpeaker 2: just when I need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me do this for you, Rafael.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's good. It's a good product, and I like it,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I have two bottles right now that I want to keep receiving for now,\n\nSpeaker 2: just when I call again.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Rafael.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then what I would like to do for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: is if you just totally cancel your prescription altogether,\n\nSpeaker 2: you couldn't be able to reorder in the future,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I can pause your account so you're not getting them every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not a problem, because if we just cancel,\n\nSpeaker 2: that means you wouldn't be able to order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I'm trying to help you out,\n\nSpeaker 2: because your prescription would be canceled,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're going to mock the account that you had a prescription with it,\n\nSpeaker 2: that you just totally terminated,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they're not going to let you order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: Rather than if you just pause, like I can pause it for like six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you're not getting it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't want you to pause it. No, just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that means you are aware that you won't be able to order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine. I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're going to take care of your request for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, it's been done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
