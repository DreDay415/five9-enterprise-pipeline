How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is John Ponzio.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a shipment of pills last week that I did not order.\n\nSpeaker 2: I canceled this a few months ago because they're not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your zip code, John?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, 0800.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm holding the bottle in my hand. I can give you the RX number.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't need that. What you gave me is enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll be able to pull this up and help you out. Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Blackwood, Barnesboro Road?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I do see that you called previously, sir, and I'm just relaying the notes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't the one that talked to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says here that the agent that spoke to you, you guys agreed to change your orders to only twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why this one was sent.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want it anymore, though, you don't have to have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that is why you were sent because I see that in the notes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it just canceled because they're not working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, if you want to return the one you have, you'll get a refund because you were charged.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that will be the last one, one way or another.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much was I charged?\n\nSpeaker 2: $103.29. So if you send that back, it will be a full refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Welcome, John.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
