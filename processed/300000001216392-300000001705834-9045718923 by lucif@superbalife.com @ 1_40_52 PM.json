My name is Brad Radloff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess I'm on your guys' auto ship plan, and I can't…\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just can't take those pills off of this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Basically, I was going to say, you can order this as needed,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you can set it up the exact day and month that they come out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you do not have to get it this way at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Yeah, because I just wanted to, I guess,\n\nSpeaker 1: just temporarily suspend it until further notice, if I can do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what I can do is just leave your prescription open\n\nSpeaker 1: for like the next five months, until June,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you basically would have to call us for your next order in that time frame.\n\nSpeaker 1: I gotcha. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then basically…\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was going to say, oh, when you mentioned pick a time or a month or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that would mean you could pick every 10th of the month it'll come out,\n\nSpeaker 2: or every three months on the 10th, every five months on the 10th,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: You could pick the 5th, or the 20th, or the 20th.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can pick the exact day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Every month, every two months, every three months, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: And you could choose when it comes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can always adjust it as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: So even if you do lock that in,\n\nSpeaker 1: like right now I can give you my name and extension,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can always change that and rearrange it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're actually really flexible with that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well, why don't we just do what you said before,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'll have to call you within the next five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: After that five months, if I don't, then the prescription lapses, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But basically you could just call me at any time in this next five months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and if you just want it to cancel out, you can call me,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I can, you know, cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you also want more time to keep ordering this way,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can call me and say,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, can we push it out a few more months from now and keep it that way?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can always give you more time as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: And also maybe reduce the number of pills too, that kind of thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you do not have to get as many pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can reduce that as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's just for now do the five-month thing,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you can give me your name and phone number.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the name is Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: Q-U-I-N.\n\nSpeaker 2: Q-U-I-N-N.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the extension is going to be 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0035, score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or managing subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, managing subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So for right now you can go ahead and suspend it until I give you a call then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, if you have any questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you have any questions or anything like that,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can call me right at that number.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get me directly.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
