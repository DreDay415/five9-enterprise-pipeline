How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my name is Jason Cooper, date of birth 11-11-1971.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, don't keep billing me every couple of months for these pills\n\nSpeaker 1: that I do not sign up for a subscription for, and I'm tired of getting charged for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem, Jason. I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I see the doctor has you on refills every two months, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see they shipped out. Let me see if I can hold the tracking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it's going to be delivered in a few days.\n\nSpeaker 2: So once you get that, just don't open it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just write return to sender on it, have it back in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way we can issue you a refund and you don't have to pay for postage.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, and then with your VIP status, you don't have to have your refills every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: What a lot of people like to do is just go ahead and pause that for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if you don't need one by then, you just call and pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause that for you until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just want to cancel the whole thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to be billed anymore for any more prescriptions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I went ahead and canceled you out. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
