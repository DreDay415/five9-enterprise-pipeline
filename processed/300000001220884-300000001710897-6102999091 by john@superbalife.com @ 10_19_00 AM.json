    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, John, I hope you can help me.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Bob Cohen, and I've tried to get, on more than one occasion,\n\nSpeaker 2: your product, the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first time I was denied when I gave my write-up,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then when I called you guys back,\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, if my cardiologist would write a letter, would we be approved?\n\nSpeaker 2: And he said, sure, if the cardiologist writes a letter, we don't need a script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just need a letter from the cardiologist.\n\nSpeaker 2: So my cardiologist sent a letter that described that I can take 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: that he recommends the 50 milligrams versus the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys first came back to me with, okay, you're approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll send it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then when the doctor got a hold of it, he saw the letter,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the letter included all of the drugs that I'm taking for years and years and years.\n\nSpeaker 2: And one of the drugs he put on the sheet was nitroglycerin, which I do not take.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay? I have not taken it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's in the sink.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the doctor, I called the doctor because you guys denied me,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the reason you denied me again is because on the list it showed nitroglycerin.\n\nSpeaker 1: I immediately called the doctor, my cardiologist,\n\nSpeaker 2: and said I'm not taking nitroglycerin.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: He said, Bob, you're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was a mistake by my people that typed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll redo the letter without nitroglycerin.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I now have the letter in hand, and I can send it back to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and with a cover letter that it was a mistake on the part of my doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you can do that, and I actually talked to you the very first time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was the one who spoke to you and told you about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can send in the letter.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yes, send that in, and we'll resubmit it again saying that there's no nitroglycerin\n\nSpeaker 1: because I just took a look at your account, sir, and it's exactly what you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor did initially say it was okay, and then they saw the nitroglycerin and denied it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we should be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you think I'll be okay the third time?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do think so with this addendum to it, with the cover letter and everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think we'll be okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: The doctor is not saying anything in the letter different other than the removal of nitroglycerin.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly what the sticking point was anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if the doctor is signing off saying I included this when he's no longer taking it or is not taking it, that'll be-\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but he's not saying that.\n\nSpeaker 2: He just took nitroglycerin out, left the rest of the letter the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Again, I don't know how to say it any other way.\n\nSpeaker 2: The issue here was nitroglycerin.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if he's taking that out, it should be fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do me a favor because it's been a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you give me your e-mail once again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want me just to e-mail you and you just reply to it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do that and then-\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have my e-mail?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have my e-mail?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I actually have the e-mail you sent, the B-colon at Prestige Group, that e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send it back to me and then I'll send it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name's John.\n\nSpeaker 2: John, thanks for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome, sir.",
