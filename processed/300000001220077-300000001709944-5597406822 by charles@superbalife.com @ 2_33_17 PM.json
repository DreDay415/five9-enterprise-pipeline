    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for calling Viagra. This is Charles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Charles. My name is Tim Jensen. I'm calling because I had ordered product from you guys back in October of last year and I received it, but I didn't realize that I was signing up for like a monthly thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called back in December because I got charged again for another round and it was sent to me, and they said that they would give me credit and put me on a program where they would check back with me in six months or whatever, something to that effect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they said once I ship the product back that I would receive a credit from you guys and I have not received that credit yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I see all the notes here. Give me one second. Okay. Let me check on this. Give me a minute. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Tim, are you with me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Sorry for the hold. So it does look like everything has already been charged back to your PayPal account. So check with them. Check that account as well. But everything has been refunded for this account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, I did. I'm looking at my PayPal account and there is no credit on there for the $113 and change.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this was returned to you at 9:56 a.m. on January 24th. So what we'll do, we'll email you. We'll email you everything. That way you can take it to your bank and PayPal. But on our end, yes, everything has been released. So it's up to your banks at this point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So when will I receive those emails?\n\nSpeaker 1: By the end of the day today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my God.",
