I'm good, thank you for asking me.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today, Diego?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just purchased the, yeah, hang on a minute, the Viagra ABB or whatever that one is, the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: ABB?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And before I checked out, everything, I looked at it over, looked it over, and it said total was $49.95 or whatever, and I went and put in my credit card info, and I got a receipt, and there's a $9 charge for pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: That wasn't on that, you know, when I checked out, before I checked out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the pharmacy fee total is $30, and then we pay half, and then we charge y'all half.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the pharmacy fee, but that wasn't stated before I checked out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Had I known that, you know, I may have made a different decision.\n\nSpeaker 2: It said it was $49 total, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not, it said that the shipping was waived.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got that notification, but I didn't get the notification about any pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now my total is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay, I mean, as a one-time offer, just, I wouldn't be able to do so moving forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I do have the option to refund you, as a first-time buyer, the pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that, and that way I'll know next time that I owe $63.95 if I reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just didn't like the, you know, the surprise.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should put that on there, about the pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now this order, this doesn't come automatically every month, does it?\n\nSpeaker 2: So every prescription with us does include refills, and if you don't want to receive the refills regularly, you don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You always have the option to place the prescription and the refills on hold for up to six months at a time, just because six months is when the prescription would expire.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we didn't refill it, and the way that works is, if you did want to place it on hold and place an order before July 23rd, you would just have to give us a call to do so yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'd rather do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I processed that refund, and if you need anything before July 23rd, just give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Diego.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
