How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've been on hold now for like 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent an email on December 23rd\n\nSpeaker 2: cancelling my order because the product didn't work for me and\n\nSpeaker 1: they went ahead and took\n\nSpeaker 2: payment out of my account today, which caused an overdraft on my account, and I'm not very happy about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I still have the email from 12/23\n\nSpeaker 2: requesting\n\nSpeaker 1: that my order be cancelled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I need your name and zip code.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hank Bennett.\n\nSpeaker 2: Zip code is\n\nSpeaker 1: 14867.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. For Chapman Road?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yes. Sorry about that. Zip code would be 14838.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I got you pulled up here, sir. I will cancel your account. I'm sorry about what happened.\n\nSpeaker 1: I looked at your email. I do see you emailed us.\n\nSpeaker 2: We did reply telling you to call us to finalize, so that's why it didn't happen, but I stopped it now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The order that was billed on the 22nd,\n\nSpeaker 2: it was put in the mail. When it arrives to you, just write return to sender on the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll come to us and you'll get a full refund for it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then your account is closed. Otherwise, you will not be billed again. Nothing else will come out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nothing will be shipped or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but I hope you have a good weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Bye. Bye.",
