    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, John. I just went online and ordered 10 of these new Viagra pills that you're offering.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it said that I was supposed to get a price of $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when I went to the receipt section, it says the charge is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's your name and zip code? I can pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: First name is Alan, A-L-A-N. Last name is Miller.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can give you my order number if you want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, the zip code's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9-5-0-7-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your first name again, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. It's John.\n\nSpeaker 1: John. Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Alan, you're in Saratoga?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, I do see your order here. That went through successfully.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should have gotten a new customer price of that $49 like you said.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll just refund you the difference there of $14.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Oh, thanks, man. You're awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so it'll take a few days. You're welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll take a few days for you to see it, but I did take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then your order's all set, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I should see it in the next couple weeks?\n\nSpeaker 2: Probably about a week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Five to seven days is the usual time frame.\n\nSpeaker 2: John, they're not paying you enough, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course. Have a good night, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I tell anybody what a great job you're doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, if you want to, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess you could send us an e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: But if you want to speak to me going forward, my extension is 0026.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00-what was that?\n\nSpeaker 2: 26.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, man. I didn't have it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you're awesome, dude. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Of course. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thanks.",
