    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra, this is Joanne, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me just a moment and I'm happy to assist you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir, I have your account pulled up here and I do see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did want you to know that we're not a subscription, so as our customer, you do have the option\n\nSpeaker 2: to put a pause on your account or to modify the frequency of your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't see that online when I went into the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: With changes like this to your account, you do have to call in and we can assist you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I can set it up however you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have customers that get their refills every month and we have some that get it twice a\n\nSpeaker 2: year and then everything in between.\n\nSpeaker 1: However you decide to set it up today, you can always modify it at any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I'm going to just cancel today, if you don't mind, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will lose your VIP status, which means that we can't guarantee the same pricing and\n\nSpeaker 1: the prescription that was written by the doctor with refills will be canceled, so should\n\nSpeaker 2: you wish to call in in a few months to place an order, you won't be able to fulfill that\n\nSpeaker 1: order.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't mind me asking, sir, how did you like the results from the Viagra 100 milligram?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was okay, but not outstanding, so, you know, it's just typical.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, do you have them in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to make sure you got the new ATV.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think, well, that was one of the issues, you know, it was advertised like that and\n\nSpeaker 1: I even called, you know, I put in a thing and it never did verify what I got.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't have that on the prescription anywhere, you know, on the bottle anywhere.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, if you don't mind pulling out one of the tablets, I can confirm whether it was\n\nSpeaker 2: the generic or the new ATV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got the tablets here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what does it say on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's hard to see it for some reason.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has an AC.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you for confirming that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you got the generic and not the new ATV, so I'm going to send you a\n\nSpeaker 1: replacement order of the ATV.\n\nSpeaker 2: How you're going to know the difference is it's going to say 100 on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you take it, you'll definitely notice a significant difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I ordered it, I ordered the other one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered the ATV and I even did an online, you know, I sent them a text and asked them\n\nSpeaker 2: about it and they said, oh, yeah, you got the right one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was sure I didn't get the right one, so I'm just wondering why would they lie to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because it looks like the order was placed for the ATV and to be honest, if you\n\nSpeaker 1: know that the ATV has been in such high demand and we're selling out, that sometimes the\n\nSpeaker 2: pharmacy will send the generic to fulfill the order and not let us know about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I wanted to confirm and ensure that you had gotten the ATV.\n\nSpeaker 2: ATV, it stands for approved generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is generic Viagra through Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's made in the same lab as the branded Viagra by the same manufacturer, except the\n\nSpeaker 2: inactive ingredients have been altered and modified.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you got a generic Viagra and I'm sending you the new and improved generic Viagra with\n\nSpeaker 2: the modifications I just mentioned.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, you know, what was so bad, they tricked me into stuff that I didn't, okay, at first\n\nSpeaker 2: I got, you know, I did the 10 tablets a month and then they offered me 10 more at a real\n\nSpeaker 1: good price.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I took it, which was a mistake because it wasn't the right ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I mean, I paid for 30 tablets now of all the wrong ones.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm just really frustrated.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send you a replacement order of 30.\n\nSpeaker 2: But why would they push 10 more when your prescription was 10?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then they sent out the next one on the schedule, which meant now you weigh ahead\n\nSpeaker 2: of how many you needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So they really kind of screwed me up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I'm going to replace every single one of those.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you've gotten a quantity of 30, I'm going to send you a quantity of 30 because you got\n\nSpeaker 2: 20 in your first order and 10 on your second order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, how do I know it's the right one?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to say 100 on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what does it say?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm having trouble reading.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was AC3 something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I told the people this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I texted them and told them, I mean, you know, used your online stuff and told them all this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, you got the right one.\n\nSpeaker 2: They said they verified it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm sitting there, how can you verify it if I got the wrong one, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's been very frustrating.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've not been very happy with my experience so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was excited.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looked like you didn't get it, but that's why I had you check the actual tablet.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was excited about it, but now, you know, I got kind of frustrated with the whole thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's totally understandable.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've already gone ahead and placed that order for a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: But now I don't want any more coming in.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would rather not more come until I use these up.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how do I do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a hold on your account until the end of July,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to give you my extension number.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, after you try the new EGV and you realize how amazing it is,\n\nSpeaker 2: you can decide how you want to set up your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's the reason I started all this.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then I started thinking maybe it was just all false advertisement since everything went wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to know, like, who and what to trust these days.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I assure you that we are FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I saw some of your ads, which I thought was real impressive.\n\nSpeaker 2: But then I realized maybe a lot of people claim stuff just to sell stuff to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So since I didn't get the right things, I was starting to think it was switching bait tactics.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, absolutely, and I'm glad that we were able to resolve the issue,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I was actually able to confirm what you got there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what I'll do is you're going to send me a replacement for everything I've got so far, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No cost?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then if I decide I like it, I can get back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to send me a contact.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you send me a text or an email?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was just going to give you my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0024.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I haven't done anything to write.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me put it in my notes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0024, my name is Joanna.\n\nSpeaker 2: Extension, 0024.\n\nSpeaker 1: 24.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0024, Joanna.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do you spell Joanna?\n\nSpeaker 2: J-O-H-A-N-N-A?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right, you got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and you're going to put me on hold until?\n\nSpeaker 1: July 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: July 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: I won't have enough tills until July 28th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so then I can, when I decide I like it and I want to continue it, I should call you back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, give me a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I'll probably run out before July 28th, but we're just 30, I think.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: I usually use about eight a month, so eight times, that would be less than, yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Joanna, I'm going to give it a shot because I kind of knew this was wrong because all the bragging they did on the new pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, I said, this is generic, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could tell it was just generic, you know, and I said, this ain't better, you know, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and, again, the one I'm sending you, once you take it, you will notice a significant difference once you take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why I came to you guys in the first place, you know, because I've read so much stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So then I actually, you know, got everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, this is no better, it's no better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't blame you for being a little bit frustrated about that, but I'm glad I was able to help you out there today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, if I don't see it, I'll probably just cancel, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give it a shot, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how confident I am that you will notice a significant improvement when you take the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I look forward to you trying it out and can't wait to hear about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Jelena, you've been most helpful.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you seem to be straight shooting me, and I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, again, I'm a little skeptical right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, understandable, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once you try the AGV, hopefully we can regain your trust and you'll be able to stay a VIP customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I was hoping that would be the case, you know, but I'm going to stay a little skeptical, you know, proof in the pudding type thing, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you have any questions or concerns, just give me a call.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate your help today.\n\nSpeaker 2: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
