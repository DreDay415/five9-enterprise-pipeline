I want to cancel a prescription I have.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, James, I can help you out with that. Can I have you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: July 26, 1944.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer. And how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I get dizzy when I take it. I almost fell down yesterday. I can't take it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem, James. I went ahead and canceled you out. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Take care of yourself. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
