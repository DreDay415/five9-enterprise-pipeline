    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, how are we doing, sir? Mr. Corey Hendricks?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, let me pull your prescription here, we'll just go blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: How may I help you, Mr. Hendricks?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, well, I went on your site and I ordered the Viagra, the new Viagra pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, once I placed, once y'all took my money, they said they wasn't going to send me that, they were going to send me something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that ain't what I paid for, so, as soon as they said that, I swore before.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what something else? Your order was placed and that's what the pharmacy is going to fulfill as you place it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they said it'll fulfill, so like, they didn't say y'all were going to send me the Viagra, they said they were going to send me something else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where? By text message?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, when the doctor came over, when the doctor's screen came over, they said they were going to send me Cetaphil.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the scientific name for any type of Viagra that you order. That's a scientific name.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, Cialis is Tadanafil, Viagra is Cetanaphil. That's a scientific name for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why they call it because they got to use the scientific appellation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra is the commercial appellation.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, um, I see your order looks great here. You ordered Viagra 100mg.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, is it the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's what you, whatever you order, the company, the pharmacy, the doctor don't change the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only things they can change if they see your medical information through the survey is the dosage.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they feel your order is 100mg and they feel this is too strong based on your health history,\n\nSpeaker 2: they might say, oh, you know, we're going to provide you 50mg.\n\nSpeaker 1: But as far as the type of medication, especially Viagra, they don't change the type that you order.\n\nSpeaker 2: What they change could be the dosage.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sir, you order 100mg based on your health history, information provided.\n\nSpeaker 2: We think that 50mg would be safer for you, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Microdosing. But they're not going to change the type of med that you order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's say you order Cialis, they're not going to tell you, hey, you cannot have Cialis, have Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Whatever you want, that's what you're going to get if your health allows you to get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they're not going to provide you something different.\n\nSpeaker 1: They might decrease the dosage if what you order is too strong for your health, but that's about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatever you place, that's what it's going to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, because you said, uh, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said they were going to send me, uh, like, when you said it came on,\n\nSpeaker 1: you were saying they were going to send me something else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sidenafil is Viagra, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is just the doctor appellation.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sidenafil is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what they use to make the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the component.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the scientific name.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what doctor will use, uh, usually.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, um, like, if you order Cialis, they're going to say, oh, we're going to provide you Tadanafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you will be like, oh, but I order Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why you give me Tadanafil?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a scientific name.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have to buy the AGB?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what you order, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, that's what you're going to receive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, cool it, cool it, cool it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm like, no, I don't want that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want what I order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, nobody change your order, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Whatever you order, that's what you receive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, the doctor have the right to lower the dosage if you feel like it's too strong based on the health information.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I see here, nothing was changed by the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, as far as dosage, you're going to receive 100 milligrams of what you order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, cool, cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set for now and two to five business days you will receive that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You placed the order on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Of course, you know that was the weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pharmacy was closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, they start working on orders today and probably tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when it's out, you're going to receive a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, Sardanafil is just a package of eggs?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a scientific name for any type of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: They use Sardanafil.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what they call it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Based on the type of Viagra you order, the type of lab, the type of formula, that's a different story.\n\nSpeaker 1: But in general, they're going to call it Sardanafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, you get the improved formula, which would be the AGV, but still it's some Sardanafil,\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's the family of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a scientific name, if that makes any sense.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, okay, cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, cool, cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes, I'm working.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so you're all set for now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everything looks great in your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, cool, cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, then I'll get my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you get it, you know, if you need to call us, you need help with something, you need to reorder, let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Y'all ain't got to sit and wait, automatically do a reload, automatically charge my card again.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can do that, or we can pause the prescription and you order as needed as well,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you tell me, hey, this is Mr. Hendricks.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need my 10 pills every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you just, it's at your liking.\n\nSpeaker 2: You let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: We make stuff the way you like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, like, I'm a big work-related person, so yeah, I just take money out of my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so that being said, you know, it's going to be paused, and then you can call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you get it, try it, enjoy it, and call us, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's what I want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get it, try it, enjoy it, and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us and tell us how you feel.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you love it, let us know how often you want it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
