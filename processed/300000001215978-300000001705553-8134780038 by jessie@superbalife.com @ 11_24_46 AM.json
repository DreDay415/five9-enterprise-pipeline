    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Rick Barnes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And then Mr. Barnes, what can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just got another order of...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you got another refill? Oh, I see. Should we go ahead and pause those for you? I'm sorry. You're getting too many too soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I wasn't aware that I was going to get repeated orders. I didn't order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry about that. Let me do this. I can just go ahead and stop those so you can order at will. Do you want me to do that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, you do have VIP status. And Mr. Barnes, before we continue, I'm sorry, are you at 425 Hobbs Street in Tampa, Florida, 33619?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and stop these so that way you don't get anything in the mail. There are no surprises, that kind of fun stuff. And you are a VIP member, which is also great.\n\nSpeaker 2: What does that mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So I'm going to freeze everything six months at a time. What that just means is it keeps your prescription active and your VIP status active.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you do not order anything at the end of six months, you just get one refill to keep everything active, okay? Other than that, you'll get nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I want to cancel my account, really.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no. Well, if you cancel it, sir, you won't be able to get the AGV anymore. And that's not something you can get at your local pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, this is not helpful. Let's put it that way. It's no different than a stand-up Miami.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me just double-check something here. Oh, you're getting this. You know what? Let me do this for you. It looks like you're getting the U.S.-made ones. That's not good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will do this for you because the AGV is the new pill that we have, and I can send you 10 free ones just so you can try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll pause everything still so you don't get anything in the mail. You know, like I said, pause everything. Don't get anything in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, don't get any, like, weird stuff or get weird charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let me replace this last one that you got so you can try the ones from France because the ones from France are the ones you cannot get from your local pharmacy because these are imported.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they will also, like, it'll have a different stamp on it as well, okay? I'll send that to you for free. Try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then everything else is paused for you so you can just rest easy and just try the pills, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're not going to charge my account anymore?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the future, you're not going to charge my account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Everything is paused for six months, like I said.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you don't like it, let us know. We'll make sure that, you know, we'll work with you and just cancel all your refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: But in the meantime, in order for me to send this out, I do need to keep your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't like it, then just let us know and we'll take care of the rest.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You're set. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
