So, I just, I looked at the USPS, this is what it says on their tracking.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says they're unable to attempt delivery of your item on January 24th,\n\nSpeaker 1: 2026 at 8:21 p.m. in Minneapolis, Minnesota, due to the hazardous or unsafe weather conditions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your item will go out for delivery on the next business day or as conditions permit.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it's looking like due to some weather issues, there's a delay,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they have it and it is on its way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay, I know I usually kind of get it within like four days, just kind of.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to throw your phone number\n\nSpeaker 1: on the USPS tracking website with your permission.\n\nSpeaker 2: This will give you notifications and you'll be able to see the status of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, you should receive a text message just now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. And that's your USPS tracking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I greatly appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for all your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anytime.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
