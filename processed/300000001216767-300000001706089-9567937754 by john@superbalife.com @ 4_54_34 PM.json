    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Let me just get into the Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What can I help you with on that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I had a prescription of PMS, but I no longer, I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I want to try the Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. Yeah, you can definitely still switch over.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need your name and zip code, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Frank Hernandez, zip code 78583.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Give me a second to pull it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Yeah, I see you ordered Cialis from us a couple times in the past.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want to switch to the Viagra AGB, that's no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have three different packages right now that you can choose from.\n\nSpeaker 2: 40 pills at $163.95, 25 for $113.95, and then 10 for $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll try the 40.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then the Cialis, it is dosed differently.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the highest dose on the Viagra is going to be 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want to do that, or did you want to go the middle of 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm doing 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So one second, I'll get you all set up.\n\nSpeaker 1: And are we still shipping to the center line road address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I give you a different address?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. It's going to be 809 Harris Road.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's spelled H-A-R-R-I-S Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: The name of the city is Harlingen, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's spelled H-A-R-L-I-N-G-E-N, Texas, zip code 7550.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I've updated the address. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not a problem to ship it there instead.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said 40 of the 100 milligrams, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. Okay. Whenever you're ready, then I will take your card, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's 5218, 5311, 9788, 5321.\n\nSpeaker 2: Next version.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1129.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the security code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 169.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So it did get declined, sir,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it doesn't mean it's like an actual issue with your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's probably your card company putting like a potential hold to make sure it's not fraud or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we have two options.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have a different card, I can try that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you may have to reach out to them and tell them that it's you making the purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to put in the order until Monday if that was the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you had a different card, I could try that now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me try a different card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Card 5218, 5326, 0485, 9396.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0830.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 948.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you read me the card one more time? I made a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It's 5218, 5326, 0485, 9396.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I put 175 at the beginning.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you said it was 1230 and 948?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. 0830.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sorry. 0830. That's right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And 948.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That one declined, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my goodness. I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're both saying the same thing to me, which is soft decline,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is almost always that the bank is just like a little worried\n\nSpeaker 2: that that's not actually you making the purchase.\n\nSpeaker 1: So like I was saying, you can reach out to them and let them know it's you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're about to close for the weekend, but if you call on Monday,\n\nSpeaker 1: my extension is 0026, and I'm happy to get your help set back up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. I did get a text saying that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you got a text?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, saying that I'm getting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Expect Y or N to protect your account.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. If you tell them it's you, I can try that card again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did they send a text back saying it's okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they just said we don't understand your reply.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on. I'm trying to see what it tells me to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: What card did I give the ending in 6294, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you gave me one that ends in 9396 and 5321.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me try one more card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully this one will do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then one last question, actually, too, because this may come into play.\n\nSpeaker 1: The billing address, the center line, or the Harris Road?\n\nSpeaker 2: On this one, the billing address is actually a P.O. Box.\n\nSpeaker 1: Try this number, 4008.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 9920.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1413.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1959.\n\nSpeaker 2: Expiration?\n\nSpeaker 1: 0927.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And 864.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully third time's the charm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Third time is indeed the charm. We're all suffering.\n\nSpeaker 2: It worked?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it worked. We're all good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: This will update your prescription, and we'll send it out at the beginning of the week.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
