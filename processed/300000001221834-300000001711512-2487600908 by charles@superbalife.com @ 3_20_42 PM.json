I'd expect it by maybe like Monday or Tuesday next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Priority, I thought you meant like overnight.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well depending on the weather, I mean overnight is very tricky right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because of all the snow that's happening all across the U.S. right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's tricky determining whether or not it's going to be overnight.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can send it overnight, but no telling if it's going to be there by tomorrow or Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was promised end of the week and I started talking to you guys and that's not, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, do what you can do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, alrighty, I'll message the pharmacy right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Expect it soon, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, bye.",
