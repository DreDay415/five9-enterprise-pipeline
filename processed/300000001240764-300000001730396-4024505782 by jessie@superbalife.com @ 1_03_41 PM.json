    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. May I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. This is a...\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. My name is Richard Rivera.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Richard Rivera.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I have a prescription with SCORE Blue. I have two problems I need to address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. One moment, please, while I locate your account. What is your zip code, Mr. Rivera?\n\nSpeaker 2: 33647.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. And you're at 15501 Bruce B. Downs Boulevard in Tampa, Florida?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. Apartment 2111.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 21...\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, there it is. Apartment 2111. All right. And let's see. You've got two problems. Please let me know. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. First of all, what prescription do you guys have me... What are you sending me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm very curious to see what you guys have down to... So what do I receive every month from you guys?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the 100 milligram pill. Let me see here. Yeah. Did you order this online?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me just see what you got here. If I may ask, did you intend on getting the AGV or the regular pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV. That's my issue. I've been paying for this, and it's not the AGV. It's the regular, and I'm very upset.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to cancel my... I've paid for this three times, and the only reason I got it is because the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've had normal Viagra, and I mean, that works all right, but the advertisement got my attention because of this AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's supposed to be better, and so according to my bottle, every time, it's just the same 100 milligram,\n\nSpeaker 1: Sedatafil, or however you say that word, and it's not... It doesn't say anything about AGV, nothing on the bottle,\n\nSpeaker 2: nothing on the pill, and so I don't need to order regular Viagra. I've already had that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. No, I can replace it for you. More than happy to replace it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but what about the money I've already spent? That's the problem, and they just charged me today another prescription of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: of another bottle for this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Rivera, I don't think you... I'm not sure if I was clear. I am replacing it, meaning we're not charging you for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are replacing the items that you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what does that mean exactly?\n\nSpeaker 1: What it means, it will send you your AGV, so what I'll do is this. Just for the sake of clarity, just for...\n\nSpeaker 2: This one that was recently shipped for February, I'm going to go ahead and send you...\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's see here. That's due to arrive Saturday, so you can toss that out since that's not the correct pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll send you the 10 pills for that first. Try them. If you love them, we'll replace the other two.\n\nSpeaker 1: If not, then you can get a refund for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and so I'm pretty sure if I... I'm just being very clear.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not that it doesn't work, but it's just not what I was ordering.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I like the AGV, I will keep it, and I would love for the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: If not, I'm just probably going to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Understood, understood. I just want to make it as easy for you as possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: We want you to get the AGV, so clearly there's been a mix-up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Happy to send that out for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's the same... And how much would that... How much would that be a month?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's actually the... It's actually the same price for this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to increase it or anything. We'll just keep it exactly as is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and who am I speaking with? Do I need to know your name or anything like that\n\nSpeaker 1: if I fall back about this issue?\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, I was about to give you my name and my extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, what is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: The name is Jessie. My extension is 0008.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way, the next time you call back, you don't have to re-explain yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, 0008. Okay, three zeros and eight... And you said it's Jessie?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right. Thank you very much, Jessie. I look forward to getting...\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, very good. Okay, bye-bye.",
