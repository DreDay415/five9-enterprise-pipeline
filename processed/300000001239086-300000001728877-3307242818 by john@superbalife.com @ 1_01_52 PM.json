You need to skip this month?\n\nSpeaker 2: Huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to skip the month?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I don't know how long it's going to take, but I'll skip it because I'm going overseas.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I come back, I'll call you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you want me to stop it entirely?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. What's your zip code, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: 44333.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And just so I can note it, you're moving and going out of the country for a while. That's why?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just so I can note in your account why I stopped it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going out of the country for a while?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I just want to make sure I heard you right. Okay. We're all set. Ridgewood Road, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. We're good to go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. We're set.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I come back, I call you on the same number I call you now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Call the same number, and I put a note in here that you're just leaving the country,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're not sure when you're going to be back, so you'll call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.",
