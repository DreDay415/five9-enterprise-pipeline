Because we\n\nSpeaker 1: have patients who say that but then the pill don't work and they try to reorder.\n\nSpeaker 2: We already lost the consultation and we got to reinvest and change the price.

If anything's changed in the future just be\n\nSpeaker 2: advised of price change if the company is okay taking your order again because\n\nSpeaker 1: I canceled the initial consultation they financed for you. You all set Mr. Baronio?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it. Bye-bye.",
