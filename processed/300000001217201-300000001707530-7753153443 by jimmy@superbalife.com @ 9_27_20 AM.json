    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jimmy. My name is Daniel. I was trying to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Daniel. Let me see if I can help you with that. Bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was trying to pull your information up off of your telephone number. I have it at—\n\nSpeaker 1: 775-315-3443. Is that the number that you want to call with this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: See, because nothing's coming up under that number. Might have been another number that you might have used when you did your order?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the only number I've had for 20 years. Okay, let's see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a zip code. Let me try it that way because that number didn't come up. Let me see if there's another number that's connected.\n\nSpeaker 2: The zip code is—\n\nSpeaker 1: 89701.\n\nSpeaker 2: And one more time your name, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Daniel Gibson, GIBS, Illinois.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you know what? It looks like they did a transposition on the last four digits because they have it at—\n\nSpeaker 1: 775-315-4334.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I was able to pull it up for you, Daniel. I do see your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get that number fixed for you too as well, but I do see you were getting the Viagra 100 milligrams—\n\nSpeaker 1: 10, looks like they were shipping those out every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me go ahead and take care of your request for you. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Daniel, thank you for holding. I was able to stop those monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also stopped that monthly refill that was including your prescription, and I stopped those monthly charges as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me ask you, Daniel, why did you want to stop your—\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what, Daniel—\n\nSpeaker 2: let me do this for you then because I'll hate the fact that you've just got an order sent to you recently and you said it—\n\nSpeaker 1: didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want you to try something for me. I'm not going to have you on any type of monthly subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want you to try something. I want to send you. This is going to be the—\n\nSpeaker 2: non-improved Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's something that just recently came out, and I'm going to send you out ten of these for free to try for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I guarantee these are going to work a lot better for you than what you receive. They're going to last longer.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're going to—\n\nSpeaker 2: work faster, and you're not going to have any type of side effects like the headaches and dizziness—\n\nSpeaker 1: that came with the older Viagra that we have.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this one is a non-improved one, and I want to send it out to you to try, and like I said again—\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to have you on any monthly refills because I want to give you one chance to try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pause your subscription for like three months, and what this will do—\n\nSpeaker 1: this will allow you to order before then anytime you want to, and you would get what I'm sending you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now the difference of these is going to be the same white shaped diamond, white shaped pill—\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's going to have the number 1-0-0 on the back. That's going to be 1-0-0.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1-0-0. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my name is Jimmy, and give me a call when you want to reorder these.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know for a fact you're going to want these.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to keep these at that same discounted price in our system when you decide to reorder, and—\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm pretty sure these are going to work for you very well. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Not a problem. I'm going to take that for you today, Daniel. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Perfect. Thank you, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Take care. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Bye-bye.",
