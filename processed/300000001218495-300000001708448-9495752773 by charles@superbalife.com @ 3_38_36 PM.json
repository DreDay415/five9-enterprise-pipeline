How about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm doing all right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, I had billing issues, transaction issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: Billing issues?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, billing, withdrawal issues, transaction issues with my bank.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael Watson, San Juan Capistrano?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, it does look like you are a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you over the phone right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm definitely not a VIP member. I don't know how that even happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: But thanks for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you sign up, your terms and conditions, they do come with all the information?\n\nSpeaker 2: When your prescription gets written up, it does come with that?\n\nSpeaker 1: What information is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: That your prescription comes with refills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and I opted out of that, and I didn't want any refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when the doctor gets everything, though, he's going to write the refills anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a standard practice for any medical industry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, but I opted not out of that, and I also e-mailed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I've already canceled that, and I have e-mails to indicate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, we ask that you always call in.\n\nSpeaker 1: We never do anything over by e-mail because it could be some guy's wife\n\nSpeaker 2: or your wife or girlfriend trying to pretend that they're you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Come to find out. We have it all happen all the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Come to find out. A guy never wants to cancel to begin with,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's a whole discrepancy because the prescription is canceled at that point.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we do have everybody call in and request cancellation over the phone,\n\nSpeaker 1: talking to one of us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that specified on the arbitrary note?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, if you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the ScoreBlue website page,\n\nSpeaker 2: all of the information is right there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, except for the prescription cancellation and how to contact somebody.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, all that's right there, too. Did you look at it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I scrolled through it, and I've called.\n\nSpeaker 2: You scrolled through it, you didn't read through it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you scrolled through it, you didn't read through it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, but did I sign anything?\n\nSpeaker 1: When you press the turn, what do you want to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael, what do you want to do? What do you want to do right here, right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want everything canceled?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it should have been canceled, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so everything is canceled, so what else would you like to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: What else would you like to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: You could fucking lose your attitude. That's the one thing, man.",
