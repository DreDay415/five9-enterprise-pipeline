    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Michael, hey, but I did exactly what you wanted and I noticed some other things in\n\nSpeaker 2: your chart and I'll share with you, but the first thing I did is I put a stop to any and\n\nSpeaker 1: all monthly shipments and I overrode the system and I sent an email to Dr. Lee and I put a\n\nSpeaker 2: stop to any and all monthly refills and I definitely put a stop to any and all monthly\n\nSpeaker 1: charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I paused your prescription and I noticed on your chart and some of these questions\n\nSpeaker 1: weren't answered but just to kind of see what was going on it says has patient Rennie ever\n\nSpeaker 2: experienced any hardness or erection within a 30 to 60 minute period while taking the\n\nSpeaker 1: 50 mg?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it says has patient Rennie ever experienced any erection or hardness longer than 6 to\n\nSpeaker 2: 8 hours by taking the 50 mg?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and then has patient Rennie ever experienced any adverse side effects other than erection\n\nSpeaker 1: and hardness within a 24 hour period?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just the red flashing and blurry vision and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: It just doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the thing about that and I'm glad that you said that Bud because if he prescribed\n\nSpeaker 2: you, we backed you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if this guy prescribed you something that didn't work, don't worry about it, I put a\n\nSpeaker 2: stop to everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't worry about any money or charges, I put a stop to everything.\n\nSpeaker 2: But to make things right, I'm going to send you something that's new and improved 50 mg\n\nSpeaker 1: that will work that we reserve for cases like you, especially when the doctor prescribes\n\nSpeaker 2: you something that doesn't work that with your physiology, I'm going to fire this doctor,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'll bill him for the replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: So don't worry about anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send you 20 pills to make you whole for December and January.\n\nSpeaker 2: When this goes through and you like these and you give me the green light, call me at\n\nSpeaker 1: 0037 and we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let's cross this bridge and don't worry about any charges or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm billing.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to bill this doctor and let him eat the prices that you paid because he sent\n\nSpeaker 1: you something that didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you 20 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get these, they're going to look identical.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to be white diamond shaped, but they're going to have a 50 on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then it's going to be zero costs.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to be rough, kind of sandy on the top and smooth in the bottom.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the reason why that is because there's no little to no side effects when you take\n\nSpeaker 2: it with water and please do not take it with any ultra processed food, no beef or pork\n\nSpeaker 1: because it's all about the absorption and it goes smoothly down your esophagus ready\n\nSpeaker 2: and it doesn't have any kickbacks.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what it does, it goes off in your gut like a grenade and it shoots to your inner\n\nSpeaker 2: membrane of your gut lining and it's your gut lining sends a message to your hippocampus\n\nSpeaker 1: in your brain and your brain tells your arc of the order where your heart is to send 70%\n\nSpeaker 2: of blood to your johnson, your schlong resulting into the biggest, hardest and longest erection.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to look the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to send it to your one, one, two, eight, three, all right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: That address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then my name, if you can, is KT Goodrich, KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is zero, zero, three, seven.\n\nSpeaker 1: One second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: KT Goodrich, zero, zero, three, seven.\n\nSpeaker 2: And when you review three, seven, 0037, think of a James Bond, but I'm Viagra Bond.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then when you call Michael, don't ever leave a voicemail because by the time I checked\n\nSpeaker 2: my voicemails, you're already gone.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, just get, tell my colleague to take down your number and I'll call you that hour\n\nSpeaker 2: or that day.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just probably went to the restroom because you know, um, I too have, I have challenges\n\nSpeaker 2: with me and I, I'm on the same stuff I'm sending you a, I'm just on the hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 1: So enjoy these, you're going to love them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me the green light in a couple of weeks or a month, do a dry run.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have a bird, I don't know your situation, but you have a bird that's willing to do some\n\nSpeaker 2: fellatio, do a dry run, you know, do some fake taxi on her and, uh, go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: But, and then, uh,\n\nSpeaker 1: Dr. Abbasi Will this work?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I had prostate cancer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will this work?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I had my prostate cancer was removed.\n\nSpeaker 1: My prostate was removed.\n\nSpeaker 2: KT Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the way this works with the prostate, cause I have prostate issues too and if you had\n\nSpeaker 2: a, you have a cancer, there's little to no side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: What this does, it helps with the vacillation, with the nitric oxide to increase the blood\n\nSpeaker 2: flows in the penile arteries, in the spongy tissues that results into erection.\n\nSpeaker 1: So try these out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if this doesn't damn work, I'll send you the activator that helps flush out your system\n\nSpeaker 1: because if that's the case, why don't I just send you 10 and then I'll send you the free\n\nSpeaker 2: activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two in the morning to a night to flush out your system because there could be like plaque\n\nSpeaker 2: kind of like in your teeth or in your ankle or your wrist when you get a, you get a sprain\n\nSpeaker 1: and what we need to do is just flush it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what I'll do is I'll send you 10 plus the activator cause you're a patient of ours.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll build a doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't worry about any charges, but we just want to take care of you and make sure you\n\nSpeaker 1: live a good life of vitality after all.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why you called.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: So just be on the lookout of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Call me next week when you get them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll be a, it'll be a slow process to get to Idaho because of you're Indiana or Idaho?\n\nSpeaker 1: Idaho.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the weather's kind of acting weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just, you know, hope you stay safe up there bud and call me at 0037 and I'll remind you\n\nSpeaker 1: on how to take the activator, right bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Cause if you had prostate cancer, it'll help flush it out and then I'll send you the 10\n\nSpeaker 1: so that way you can have the experience that you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you had before is good stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm glad that you told me that you did have your prostate removed because even with the\n\nSpeaker 2: prostate removed, this stuff should work.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, let's, you know, like if I could say if it's any consolation, I don't know\n\nSpeaker 1: if you ever heard of it, but Mark 1124, therefore I say to you, my brother and Michael, whatever\n\nSpeaker 2: things you ask for when you pray, believe it that you will receive them and you will\n\nSpeaker 1: have them in his mighty loving name, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You bet brother.\n\nSpeaker 1: God bless you bud and we'll be here for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just call me next week and when you get those and I'll guide you through the process.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks KT.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bet bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: God bless you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.",
