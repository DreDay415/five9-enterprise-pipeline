    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Tom Flighter. Yes, my name is Tom Flighter. I called and had a conversation with your office\n\nSpeaker 1: or with one of your customer service agents about 3 to 4 weeks ago, maybe a little less,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I never wanted to subscribe. I canceled it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if I can pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 909-645-0359.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Tom. Did you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-18-53.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Okay, let's see. Looks like you canceled out on the 14th. You returned the package.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on. Let me open up the account and make sure your refund was issued.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I canceled that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that was – hold on. Okay, so on the 14th of January, they issued you a refund\n\nSpeaker 2: for the $63.95. Let me get my calendar out sometime.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that went to my credit card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it went to the Visa ending in 4971. Sometimes it takes up to 10 business days,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I have my calendar. Okay, the 14th. So the next week, Thursday, Friday.\n\nSpeaker 2: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Today would be day 10, business day 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that happens in 10 to 14 days, you said?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, they refunded it on January 14th, and it automatically comes out of our account.\n\nSpeaker 1: For some reason, people's banks take longer to process it through on their end.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you don't see it today, you should call your bank,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I do see it was issued here on January 14th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I haven't dived into it that extensively. I simply wanted it to go away\n\nSpeaker 1: when I contacted you guys, and you were very nice. Your customer service is great.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the word didn't get to GoGoMeds that I had canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: As a result, I'm staring at another bottle, which I now guess you want to have us return.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, do you still have the envelope?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do, but I'm really not excited about doing any of this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, just go ahead and write return to sender on there, and just attach it to your mailbox\n\nSpeaker 1: so that the mailman will take it tomorrow, and you don't have to pay for postage\n\nSpeaker 2: because it has a tracking number on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but let's make sure GoGoMeds knows I'm no longer a customer, number one.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're already canceled out. You're totally canceled out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it didn't work. I just talked to GoGoMeds, and I'm holding the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think when you called, it already shipped out, so they couldn't cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't plan on calling them. I called you to cancel it and thought that would automatically –\n\nSpeaker 2: she didn't intend to ever hear from GoGoMeds again, but I'm holding the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see here on January 7th, you called and canceled it, but they charged your card on the 5th,\n\nSpeaker 2: so it was already being mailed out when you called in, so she couldn't cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just write return to sender and pop it back in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, it was already on the way as of the 5th, and now we're – what's the date we're talking about now?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's horrible. I'm glad I didn't need it quickly.\n\nSpeaker 2: You called in on the 7th, and the refill was scheduled for the 5th,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that's why she couldn't cancel it out before you called.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I received this on the 27th. That's – wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, because all this charge, probably. Let me –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, probably. I'm sure there's no need, but I'm really not –\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it was delivered on the 12th, it says.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just write return to sender, and then –\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. But now I have to wait for another refund for 2 to 4 weeks or whatever, 10 to 14 days, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, just call us in like 10 days after you send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to call you. I just want it to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, they automatically issue you a refund as soon as we get that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and you can assure me that I've been canceled and that GoGoMed will be informed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah. No, your profile is totally, completely canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Try it again. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thanks. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Bye-bye.",
