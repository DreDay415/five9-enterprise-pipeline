    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I was just calling to see if I could cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, I can help you out with that. Give me one second to pull up your profile.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, Augustine, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it's 12-13-85.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see the doctor put you on refills on a monthly basis, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't really work for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm asking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it looks like here I can see from the pharmacy's notes you did not receive the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: They sent you just the regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second. I'm going to get you out of replacement,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm you received the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to send you 100 milligrams instead of 50s.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Alright, perfect. So that went through.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you a quantity of 2,500 milligrams instead of 50s.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you get this new bottle, on the bottle it's going to say AGB,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it's also going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the pill, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now imprinted on your pills is going to be the letters AC,\n\nSpeaker 2: I think 390 or 340 or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your bottle will say APCO.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's just generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm sending you out the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it until July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'll give you my extension so you can let me know how the AGB works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect. Do you have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: 0020.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020 and my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, not a problem. Have a great day, Augustine.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, you too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Bye.",
