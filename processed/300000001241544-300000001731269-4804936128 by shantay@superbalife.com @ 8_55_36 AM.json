    "text": "Speaker 1: Good morning. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I was told I had to call you to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I have your name as well as your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Daniel Delaware. What was the second thing?\n\nSpeaker 1: Your date of birth.\n\nSpeaker 2: 10-26-1967.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And while I'm pulling up your account, Daniel, may I ask the reason for wanting to cancel your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just not working like I wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I see that you have a prescription for the generic Viagra, the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Isn't that the HEV?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you're not getting the HEV. Is that what you wanted?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I knew it. Yes, I knew it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I called you. I notified you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it diamond-shaped?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I said, yes, you're getting the HEV.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew it wasn't real. I knew it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do you have your bottle in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. It says nothing about HEV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can you read me or can you take one of the pills out and can you tell me what's the markings on the pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let me go get it. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I knew it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have to turn the light on, Chris.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's see. Is it diamond-shaped?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got the glasses on. I can't tell if I got it right side up or upside down.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the glasses on. I can't tell if I got it right side up or upside down.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So on the back of the pill, AC and then 339.\n\nSpeaker 1: I looked that up and it said generic Viagra, but the person argued with me.\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I knew it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. No, if it says AC on there, that's not it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry that you didn't receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can have the pharmacy replace what you received so you can actually try it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. For free? I don't want to charge anyone.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, absolutely. Yeah. It's going to be for free because that's what you paid for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay. I'll go with that and then I'll try that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Try that. Then give us a call back and let us know how that works for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you're going to get the free replacement. Give it about three to five days.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your help. I really do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You're welcome, Daniel. It's my pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
