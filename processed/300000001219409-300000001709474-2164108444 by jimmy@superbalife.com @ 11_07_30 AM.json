    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Jimmy, how can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Jimmy, how's your day going, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going pretty good, how about you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, good, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just recently put in an order for your new Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it got to the point where it asked me to put a password in,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it already, for some reason, already had a password,\n\nSpeaker 2: which I did not put in, and now I'm stuck,\n\nSpeaker 1: even though I've given my credit card number, my address, and all that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know what password is in there, because I didn't put one in.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I put a password in that I usually use when I buy an online product,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so it doesn't recognize that,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I really never had a chance to put a password in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you tell me what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this Clyde?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this Clyde that I'm speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Clyde Daig.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Clyde, I do have your information up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see that your order was placed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm glad you called, though, because that's always the best way to do it,\n\nSpeaker 1: because you're trying to get the AGB, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it looks like that you put in for the 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a recommendation for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I think if you go with the 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: you'll probably be more satisfied with that one,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, plus, if that one's too strong for you, what a lot of people do,\n\nSpeaker 1: Clyde, they just break it in half.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's the same thing as the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, if you break it in half, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I already have a prescription from my doctor for 50 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if this is more potent than the old Viagra, I may split it in half\n\nSpeaker 2: and make it a 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just sharing with you how a lot of people work it,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I just thought I would share that with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, and I've done that before, but I've never gotten a 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've always gotten 50 and split those in half.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let's just go ahead and go with the 50, and if it comes over well\n\nSpeaker 1: and everything's working, next time I'll order 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because that's what your prescription is going to have.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to have the 50 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so the order was placed and it was done.\n\nSpeaker 2: As far as your password is concerned,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would recommend that you just give us a call when you're ready to order,\n\nSpeaker 2: because a lot of times when you're online, a lot of things get mixed up and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's up to you as far as you say you can't get the password.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm fine with calling you guys and ordering it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've already written your phone number down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's actually saved in my phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that would be preferable because I don't like using passwords all the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd rather talk with a real person.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, and that's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we went ahead and I see your order, so okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I didn't see a shipping charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: It must be free shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's not free shipping, unfortunately.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the actual total, I'll tell you right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I see you upgraded for the additional five pills for the 1470.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll tell you what the actual total that you're going to see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bear with me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 1470.\n\nSpeaker 1: How much?\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's going to be a total of $78.65.\n\nSpeaker 1: That includes shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: The shipping cost is a tracking number, so you know that it's getting there.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is the shipping, just out of curiosity?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the shipping is usually $9.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, $13.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: $13.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because for the original tin, it's $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: For the original tin, it's the additional 1470.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and the total amount again, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: $78.65.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, we're good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
