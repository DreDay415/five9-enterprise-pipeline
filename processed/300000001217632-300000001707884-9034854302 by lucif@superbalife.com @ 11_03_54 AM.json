What is your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Royce, R-O-Y-C-E, Fouse, F-O-U-S-E.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your phone number?\n\nSpeaker 2: I got a cell of 903-517-5455 and I'm calling you on my home—\n\nSpeaker 1: Number of 903-485-4302. Alright, so which one do you have on file with this? Was it—\n\nSpeaker 2: The cell phone or the home phone?\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably the cell. Okay, give it to me one more time.\n\nSpeaker 2: 903-517-5455.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Alright sir, this is your VIP customer here with us getting a Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you mind if I ask why you're cancelling or you said that you didn't order it?\n\nSpeaker 1: All I did was order it and I never received it. Are you at 1129 Industrial Drive?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. What about the 3265 County Road?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's my home.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the Industrial Drive address?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a business in town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it looks like it was shipped to that address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's a business in town. I used to work there a long time ago, but I haven't in a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Somebody used that address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's weird.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, my Walmart account had been hacked.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazon and eBay and a couple of credit cards.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you don't need this medication you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, you can order this as needed. You don't have to worry about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, my wife had cancer for eight years, so I haven't needed it or nothing, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir, we'll take care of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can I get an email saying it has been or a text or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: We just have the verbal confirmation. We don't really send an email for that, but your prescription—\n\nSpeaker 1: Is cancelled. You will never receive this again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any way I can receive any credits on any of it? I've looked at it four times.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a 90-day return policy that we have, so all that would be outside of the return policy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
