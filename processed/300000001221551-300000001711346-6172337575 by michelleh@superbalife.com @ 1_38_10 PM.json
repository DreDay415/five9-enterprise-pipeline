I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Vincent, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 8-26-52.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you wanted another refill of 25-50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to up it to 100 milligrams? Same price.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure. What is it? Instead of 50, it's 100 a piece?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you could break them in half, too. Just get more paper.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, sometimes I end up taking two, so it'll be better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Taking two, yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, cool. That would be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, are we still using your Visa ending in 3289?\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, perfect. Here we go.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, perfect. That's in place. They'll be shipping out to you tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
