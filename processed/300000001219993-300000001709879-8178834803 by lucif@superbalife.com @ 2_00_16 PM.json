75032.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Robert Dowdy, D-O-W-D-Y.\n\nSpeaker 1: One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me your phone number on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: 817-883-4803.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have another phone number?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's just – that's the one I use.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you need –\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me the zip code again.\n\nSpeaker 2: 75032.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said Robert Dowdy?\n\nSpeaker 2: Dowdy, D-O-W-D-Y.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it Bob Dowdy?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's Bob Dowdy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what was going on with the virus?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why is it that you're looking to cancel today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm honestly – I just can't afford it at this time and I'm trying to – I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got three bottles of them here and I've got plenty to last for a while.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you can order the rest and eat it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to get them this frequently.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I know, but I mean, they keep sending them to me and I haven't even went through one bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we would stop that and you would have a six-month period where you can call for your next order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, that would be better than them taking it out of my account every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that works a lot better for a lot of people.\n\nSpeaker 2: I definitely understand why everybody uses it every year, every day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you stop the one and refund me the –\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's already been shipped since the 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, did it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should actually be seeing that soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure the weather might hinder that, but it should actually be there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it'll probably be here sometime, maybe Saturday, probably.\n\nSpeaker 2: But like I said, we can't stop that and allow you to go ahead and order as needed going forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they gave me so many of them, I don't know how I'm going to be able to use them in six months, but you never know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, maybe, but you can always call us and request more time if need be.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've only used one, and it didn't give me the results that I was looking for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And these pills, they don't actually say A, G, B, but, you know, pictures say they do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it says they do on the bottle, not on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess the generic brand, which is fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just, you know, I got to get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did have something to eat before I ate them, and I don't think I really waited the full hour to give it a chance to work with me eating something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you want to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I took it before I ate my food, but I didn't wait probably long enough before I ate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not supposed to eat at all when you take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're supposed to take it on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do you consider how long I should wait after I've eaten, considered an empty stomach, a couple hours?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just, yeah, a few hours or so.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just want to eat as little, you know, so if you're going to do a tour tonight, you just don't want to eat any large meals before you take it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, obviously, some snacking or something like that should be fine,\n\nSpeaker 2: but if you need kind of like large meals at dinner or something like that, it will affect the results.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just ate some donuts and some chocolate milk after I took it, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that shouldn't be too bad then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but it didn't give me the results that I was looking for, but it helped some, but it didn't help a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm 65, no, 66, and so I just got to try to give it a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got to try it better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because if not, then I can try to send you something else, one of our newer versions,\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if that consideration is working for you better.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have our newest burger from France.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I can always send you some of those if that ends up not giving you the best results.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can see if that works for you better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let me give this a chance because I've got quite a few here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've got probably over 40 pills, plus I've got another bottle coming.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't even know how many is in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they've sent me a bottle almost every month, and I think the first bottle they gave me, they had 20 in it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but those other orders only have 10, so it looks like you only have 40 altogether.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Including the ones on the way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So mine is one that I've taken out of all of it, but me and my girlfriend hadn't been seeing each other much\n\nSpeaker 2: because I had my father in the hospital in December.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, he was in the hospital 11 days, so I wasn't able to do anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we had planned on it, but it didn't work out the way I wanted it to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully after this major storm we got here in Dallas, maybe next weekend or week after next,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can spend a little bit more time together.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I hope you do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you get the chance to us also.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So from now on, it'll be every six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, or as needed in between.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I just need to call if I want it any sooner.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can actually call my extension if you like at 0035.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0035.\n\nSpeaker 2: I guess I better write that down because I'm old.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your name again?\n\nSpeaker 2: Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if I want to try something different, all I have to do is ask you, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Quinn.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0035?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much for your time today.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you're very welcome, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
