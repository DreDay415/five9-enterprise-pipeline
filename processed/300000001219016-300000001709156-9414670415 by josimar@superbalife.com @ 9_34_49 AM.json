    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm calling about the score blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've ordered once, got it, never reordered,\n\nSpeaker 2: never said I wanted more, was charged $113 and change,\n\nSpeaker 1: plus $59 and something the first time,\n\nSpeaker 2: which I don't know why I was charged $59.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then I all of a sudden got another order\n\nSpeaker 2: for the same number of pills that I don't need or want,\n\nSpeaker 1: and never got a reply back when I send an email.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I don't want to be charged today.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: S-A-N-D-R-O 33917.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pulled up, so you're based on the, is it Michael?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it, so you put positive in our system here.\n\nSpeaker 2: So your first order was done in November,\n\nSpeaker 1: by any chance did you get to read the terms and condition\n\nSpeaker 2: that was emailed to you after placing the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't go through all that,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I want to cancel it regardless.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, not a problem, not saying anything regarding that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just explaining to you, basically on there\n\nSpeaker 1: tells you how every order, since it's through Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 2: has to be on a prescription refill date to be activated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once they are, you get to actually call us\n\nSpeaker 2: to modify it, but if you don't reach out to modify it,\n\nSpeaker 1: it'll be sent out on the doctor's,\n\nSpeaker 2: so the date he chose for you, basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why you got one order shipped out on, I think,\n\nSpeaker 2: January 15, because you're set up to every two months,\n\nSpeaker 1: it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your first order was also 25 pills for 113,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you got an additional 25 for 59.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's worth a total of 50 for your first order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your refill was only 25 pills, because that's\n\nSpeaker 2: based off the first order, but just the first part of it,\n\nSpeaker 1: not the pill quantity upgrade.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could go ahead and cancel you out for any future orders,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if you want, you could send that last one back\n\nSpeaker 2: for the refund, but I do want to mention,\n\nSpeaker 1: if I do cancel you out, the prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: will be deleted through the doctor's end,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you wouldn't be able to order this anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, I could always just switch you over\n\nSpeaker 1: to our six-month plan, where you could just freeze it out,\n\nSpeaker 2: and always call us when you need them,\n\nSpeaker 1: or just call us to delay it for another half year,\n\nSpeaker 2: but that way you can retain access to the pill\n\nSpeaker 1: for when you need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, like I said, I don't even know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if these things are real.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, they're through Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're through Pfizer in France,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they're also FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only reason we need to have those dates on there,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the prescriptions need to be refilled\n\nSpeaker 1: by a certain time frame, or else they get closed out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, just put me on six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it, and I'll email you the return instructions\n\nSpeaker 2: for the six-month plan, and I'll let you know\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it, and I'll email you the return instructions,\n\nSpeaker 2: that way you can send the ones you have now for the refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you open them up at all, or is this just completely sealed?\n\nSpeaker 2: Completely sealed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it's also like an envelope.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not opened up from the envelope?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, you actually can do it a lot easier then.\n\nSpeaker 1: All you have to do is write refuse slash return to sender,\n\nSpeaker 2: and just drop it off at the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to pay for any return shipping that way.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, and then other than that,\n\nSpeaker 2: I already changed over to that plan,\n\nSpeaker 1: but give us a call if you want to make any modifications.\n\nSpeaker 2: More than happy to help you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it. Bye.",
