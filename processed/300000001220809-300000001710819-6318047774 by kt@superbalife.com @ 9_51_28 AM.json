    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, Bud, Joe, as a veteran, I take a lot of pride and honor in my work, so let me give\n\nSpeaker 2: you my extension as a reference if you need anything at all, you can let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0037, and then last name is Goodrich, Matera, so Bravo 18, man, 18 Bravo.\n\nSpeaker 2: So here, check this out.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did three things for you, Bud, to put you on a right path, and so the first thing I\n\nSpeaker 2: did is exactly what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: The second thing I did is I overrided the system and I put a stop to any and all monthly\n\nSpeaker 1: shipments and charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the third thing I did is I canceled this doctor and I set you up with a different one\n\nSpeaker 1: because what I've noticed is if they didn't work, she wrote you the wrong script and I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: going to bill this guy and I'm going to send you a replacement for free, but you're not\n\nSpeaker 1: going to eat any of the fees because you're already paid, and if you didn't get the damn\n\nSpeaker 2: thing that worked, I'm going to send you a free replacement and these things should work\n\nSpeaker 1: because if they don't work, I'll let him, he's going to eat the bill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you 20 pills, a pill for pill, to make you whole, Bud, because\n\nSpeaker 1: if you didn't get the right thing, that just really, that grinds my gears, Bud, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any way of refunding that $63.95 that was charged to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't authorize that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, so what we can do is, this is what we can do, Bud, to make things easier.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see this last batch that got sent to you on the 23rd and it probably, let me see when\n\nSpeaker 2: it got landed.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's, okay, so this is what we're going to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is the play we're going to run.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to start the credit process for this refund, but you have a batch that's trying\n\nSpeaker 2: to be delivered to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's already in process.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says processing at destination and I'll show you how to track that, okay, but it comes\n\nSpeaker 1: to you on Thursday at 9 p.m. because of the weather, usually it takes faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you get this, Joe, take the damn package, don't open it up, circle the address on the\n\nSpeaker 1: top left corner and write refuse, return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to pay for anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have a tracking number on it and just put it in a blue USPS bin, you know, in those\n\nSpeaker 2: boxes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll come back to us as I'm starting this refund process for January.\n\nSpeaker 2: By the time it gets to us, by Monday or Tuesday, I'll have the pharmacy release the funds.\n\nSpeaker 1: They just need to verify that they got it and we have a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm driving and I don't have a pen with me, can you send me your contract information?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can do that, but just remember, 0037, so when you call the same number, just dial\n\nSpeaker 2: 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you can't get me and you get someone else, just tell them, hey, this is Joe, he's working\n\nSpeaker 2: with me, just let him know I called and I will call you back within that hour or that\n\nSpeaker 1: day.\n\nSpeaker 2: But let me just recap what I'm doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments, charges, and refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I paused your prescription and I'm starting back the credit process for this batch of\n\nSpeaker 1: January.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, the December batch, I'm not authorized to do a credit, I mean, there is no credit\n\nSpeaker 1: for that, but I can send a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to send a replacement for those that is something that will work, it's an\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV, it's going to look the same, but I'm going to bill the doctor so he can eat that,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: See, that's what I thought I was getting, I thought I was getting the AGV is what I\n\nSpeaker 2: was trying.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so when I looked at your script, it says 50 milligrams, but it doesn't say AGV 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this is what you're going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get the pills, don't read the bottle, when you open up, don't get the packages confused\n\nSpeaker 2: because this one's coming the next wave.\n\nSpeaker 1: This will be back to you like next week, Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when you pull out the pill, Joe, it'll say 50 on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the golden age.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you decipher that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to send you 10 of those, then we'll get you the refund for the other ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I won't be getting billed for anything else?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, we're going to run, this is a Hail Mary, let's see if it works, don't worry\n\nSpeaker 1: about any charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because your money's no good unless we can, you know, get something that actually works,\n\nSpeaker 2: bud, because otherwise, what the hell, just go somewhere else.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's make you whole, let's get that money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get you 10 for the December batch.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then in the future, when you do get home, right, or wherever you're at, go to scoreblue.com\n\nSpeaker 2: on your browser, log in with your Yahoo account.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you log into your Yahoo account, you're going to see a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's going to be a tracking number on there, in that area, you can click and follow\n\nSpeaker 1: it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other thing I'm doing is I'm putting a red button, so in the future, like in a month\n\nSpeaker 1: or two, you give me the green light of the stuff I'm sending you, you don't need to get\n\nSpeaker 2: blindsided, you just click that damn button and you get it whenever you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, even if you're traveling from Florida to Vegas, you can just update the address,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's cross this first bridge, and then just remember, 0037, 0037 Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that snafu, but I'll make it right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: But no worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call me back next week, and then we'll get this thing going, all right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Adios.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
