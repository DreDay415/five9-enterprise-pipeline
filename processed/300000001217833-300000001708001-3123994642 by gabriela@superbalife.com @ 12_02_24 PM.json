    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is Andrew Johnson and I ordered the sky blue, the newest sky to make you bigger.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I haven't received it.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, my name, Andrew Johnson. Date of birth, 11-23-50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and when did you place the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: When did you place the order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm thinking the 24th or something like that, maybe the 23rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: The 23rd of this month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so yes, that's the reason why you haven't received anything, because you haven't placed an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Last time you placed an order was back in November.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no, no. What are you saying to me?\n\nSpeaker 1: You just drafted my account, so I did place an order. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said I didn't place an order?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you haven't placed an order. Your payment method didn't go through. It got declined.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I don't understand that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, wait just a moment, because I pulled up my account, my third account, and I saw where you guys had drafted my account, so I think it's 69. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you have a trade-off with me?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if that's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Shucks.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your shipping address?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was going to come to 400...\n\nSpeaker 2: 400 East 41st Street?\n\nSpeaker 1: East 41st Street, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes. It looks like I found you here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yes, it looks like you placed the order on the 24th. Your prescription ticket approved on Saturday. We're not open on the weekend, so your order is supposed to be shipping out today. Well, tomorrow. And then you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alrighty. Of course. You're welcome, Andrew. Bye.",
