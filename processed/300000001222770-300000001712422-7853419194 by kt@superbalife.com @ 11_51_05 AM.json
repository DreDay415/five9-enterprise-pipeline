I woke up above ground, not beneath, if you know what I mean.\n\nSpeaker 2: Any day above ground is a good day to...\n\nSpeaker 1: That's my mantra, dude, right there. That is it.\n\nSpeaker 2: God blessed me with another day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amen, brother.\n\nSpeaker 2: I say I'm not six feet in a hole when somebody's throwing dirt on top of me. I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're a badass, bro. You're a badass.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm about six feet in the ground, man, and somebody's throwing dirt on top of me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hey, you know what? We're in America, dude. What is there to complain about?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, we can complain all we want, but you just get up and grind, man,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you get the change that you want, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Don't just whine, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, don't whine. Just go get it done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, bud, I'm going to take care of you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just correct me if I'm wrong, because I see that you're a VIP one,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're a true blue, man. You're a real one. You're a real American.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to take care of you, and I'm a veteran, so I'll definitely take good care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you a veteran?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Bravo 18, bud. 18 Bravo, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your service, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it wasn't for guys like you, we wouldn't have the freedom we got.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bro, I always say it's your welcome day when it rolls around, but you're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do it again, but I've been rocked, bro. I've been rocked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: They helped me out here at Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: They gave me a shot, and I was homeless during COVID.\n\nSpeaker 1: But anyhow, bud, I'm going to help you put a stop to this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just help me confirm what I see is you were working with Dr. Riley Green,\n\nSpeaker 1: and she set you up as a VIP, and she wrote a script for the FDA-approved Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 2: the white diamond pill, the AGV, I believe, and it's made in our Pfizer-Lazen front.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I do see that Dr. Green has ordered the pharmacy to send refills on her behalf.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to put a stop to that and you can get it when you want, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, when I first ordered all this stuff, I don't remember requesting.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't pay anything. I don't like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, I'll set it up where you get it when you want, but I'll put a button for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you could just call me and just work with me, and I'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and you can reduce it down to five pills at a time.\n\nSpeaker 2: When I call refilling, can I request a quantity as well?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll see if I can adjust, but I think the minimum refill quantity is 10,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I'll set it up for you where you can click it, a button, at your leisure.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll do that for you now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me about a minute, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ask you a question?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: What nationality are you, and where are you from?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm Chamorro.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm from the Mariana Islands, like Guam, but my father's from Texas.\n\nSpeaker 2: He's a Green Beret.\n\nSpeaker 1: You sound like your dad, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks for your service, man, because my dad served.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: My uncle served.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a couple cousins that served.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't serve out of high school.\n\nSpeaker 1: My dad told me, you know, you're going to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to make or break you, but with my hot temper and quick fisted ass,\n\nSpeaker 1: he said you're probably going to wash out.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but, you know what, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jiu-jitsu, bro.\n\nSpeaker 1: After the service, for my mental health and my emotional regulation,\n\nSpeaker 2: every day there's not one minute where I don't feel like choking someone.\n\nSpeaker 1: But in jiu-jitsu, you can go there and you can actually choke someone\n\nSpeaker 2: and you won't get in trouble.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I never thought about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how I was out of high school.\n\nSpeaker 1: Quick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Quick to fight.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can do jiu-jitsu if you're like 80, 90 years old, bud, and it's free.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, like you go there and they can't sue you or anything,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it's legal.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can smother them.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can choke them, you know, and they'll be good to go.\n\nSpeaker 2: They all signed up for the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Same thing, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I never thought about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's pretty cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sometimes you're the hammer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes you're the nail, but, you know, try to be the hammer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wish I would have done this when I was 18.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would have definitely served, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Damn.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, don't worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can still do jiu-jitsu, but let me handle this, Scott,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I'll take care of you and I'll give you my extension when we get done.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Stand by.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
