    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, my name is Al Thomas. I'm looking to put a pause on my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I don't want them just sent, constantly sent. I mean, I'll call when I need them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem. Let me get your telephone number, please, because it looks like you was transferred over to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't mind? Can you do that for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm on my office phone, but my phone number that's connected to you is 413-\n\nSpeaker 1: I said the number-\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I heard you, but you went in and out.\n\nSpeaker 1: The number you guys have is not the- I'm on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, no. I don't have that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you was transferred over from the pharmacy anyway, so give me your number that's on the account. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm telling you. It's 413-46-6457.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much for that. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have 413-456-246.\n\nSpeaker 1: 246. Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: You there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to pull it up, but there's nothing coming up.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe I put it in wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give it to me one more time, please, because you was going in and out on me, and I couldn't hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 413-246-6457.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Thank you, Alan. I was able to pull it up. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, sure, we can take care of your request and pause it out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like that. It's coming like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because your prescription looks like you're getting the Viagra 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like they had you scheduled to get chin every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I can pause it. How long would you like to pause it out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can just call when I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Actually, to keep the prescription, I have to put a certain time out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could do like five months, six months. Does that work for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if that comes too soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: If it comes too soon, five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can call sooner, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you can call sooner, or if five months comes too soon, you can actually call and say,\n\nSpeaker 1: Push it out a few more months. We'll work with you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got it, man. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. I'll just take care of that for you. Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
