    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a billing from you guys, like a recurring billing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I bought some of your products about a month or so ago,\n\nSpeaker 1: and I just got billed again for your product again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never signed up for a recurring billing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, did you get an opportunity to read the terms\n\nSpeaker 2: and conditions after placing your first order?\n\nSpeaker 1: When I did the order, it said that you take it and I get it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and that was it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't state that anywhere on your website, sir,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I was asking you, did you read the terms and conditions\n\nSpeaker 2: after placing your first order?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: So basically it just tells you how every order is a prescription-based\n\nSpeaker 2: order because these are real medications through Pfizer,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they need to have a refill date to be activated.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the doctor chooses your frequency, but you can call us to modify it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it just looks like you didn't modify it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your last name and a zip code so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't modify anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Walter Bell.\n\nSpeaker 1: My zip code is 85233.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the transaction ID number that you guys sent to PayPal, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah, and I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you didn't modify it,\n\nSpeaker 1: so that means you didn't change it from the original date the doctor set\n\nSpeaker 2: for you, which is two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how your receipts were billed today.\n\nSpeaker 2: I see that the order is currently at the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I can cancel it out for you and help you with the refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cancel it out for me, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will take three to five business days to hit your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: However, regarding the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: it needs to have a refill date to stay active.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't mean you need to take the package\n\nSpeaker 1: or get the order processed, but it needs a refill date.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I could do for you, though,\n\nSpeaker 1: is set you up for every six-month freeze plan.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can retain access to this for when you need it down the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: Every six months?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, you don't need to get it every six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: but that's the furthest we can take it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you can call us and let us know, hey, I need it before then,\n\nSpeaker 1: and say, hey, you know what, push it even further.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have no problem with that whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, why don't we just hold off on that for right now,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I would appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's just cancel what we've got going here.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I need it, I will call you guys back again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I was mentioning the six-month plan, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only method of doing that, because I'll cancel it out\n\nSpeaker 2: and give you the refund for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for the refill date so the prescription remains active,\n\nSpeaker 1: I do need to set a refill date, which is why I was mentioning the six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you can always call us to push it even further if you need more time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't want a refill right now, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, you won't get a refill right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I already told you that you wouldn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to get a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're talking about a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get one in six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription needs to – no, I didn't say that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I told you it needs a refill date to stay active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Without that, the prescription itself closes and the doctor shuts down the visit\n\nSpeaker 2: and you wouldn't be able to order in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, if we just freeze it out for you like that,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're able to just call us and tell us, hey, I need six more months,\n\nSpeaker 1: or, hey, I just need you to send it out because I need them now.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll just switch you over to that plan so you can retain access to your medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: I made that modification to the six-month plan\n\nSpeaker 2: and I canceled out the order in the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll get that refund back in three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
