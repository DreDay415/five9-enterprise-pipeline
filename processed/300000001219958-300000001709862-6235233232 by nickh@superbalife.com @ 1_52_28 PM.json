    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Nick. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, Nick. So I ordered some Viagra off of your online thing and I didn't get Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got generic Viagra, which is not Viagra. It's Adenafil, but it's not Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Viagra is a brand and I did not get Viagra and I'm asking to get what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. And we can definitely take care of this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need to walk through your prescription here and see what was prescribed, how it was ordered, and when.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let me take a look here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, can you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 4-20-1967.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So Richard, did you place this order online?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you're right. It looks like you did select a new Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: but for some reason the doctor wrote you a script for generic Adenafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I can do for you is I can get you the replacements.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what to expect on these though?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I want to explain what AGV is, what Viagra is, and what you received.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you received is generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So yours on the bottom right of the bottle, I'm assuming it says Apco Pharma.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have the bottle in front of me, but it says generic Viagra on it. I'm not sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure, sure, sure, sure. So Apco Pharma is the pharmacy here in the United States that creates a generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's nothing wrong with it. It is just a bit dated and it is an older formula.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you have the original blue pill, which is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What you will be receiving is authorized generic Viagra from France, from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what that means is it's the exact same drug as the brand name version,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's sold without the brand name on the label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay? So this allows them to sell it at a lower cost,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it is marketed with the brand name company's permission.\n\nSpeaker 2: Same active ingredients, all that good stuff. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So yours, what you will be getting, what I'm replacing it with, will say Greenstone LLC on the bottom right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are from Greenstone, the laboratories. That's in France. That's under Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: The bottle itself will say Sidenafil parentheses AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sidenafil is the leading ingredient in all Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay? Including this one and the generic. That's why I said it there. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Your pill will say 100. What you probably receive says a generic code like AC340 or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your pills will be a white diamond shape and will say 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how to assure that you receive the AGV. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's funny, but when I look up AGV online,\n\nSpeaker 2: there's nothing online at all that says anything about AGV other than your ad.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is supposed to be from Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why it's kind of, I don't want to call it confusing,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's a little disheartening that this is really what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you search Viagra AGV, I mean, it will...\n\nSpeaker 1: All that pops up is your ad. There is nothing else.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir. Well, it is authorized Viagra from Pfizer. It's from Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is FY approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the case?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, would you like me to send you those replacements?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can do that for you right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll get that taken care of for you, and you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
