    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, Jelena speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this Jelena?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it is, sir. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've been trying to get a hold of people for over 30 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is David Walls. I seem to have a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're not sending me nothing. I don't know what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't even get in my email. I log in my deal and it says not valid.\n\nSpeaker 2: Interesting. Okay, Mr. Walls, I have your account pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: The good news is the doctor has already concluded the medical portion.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it looks like the prescription was written and it's currently at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the pharmacy should probably ship it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, supposedly he said I needed to quit taking beetroot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do see a note of that. It says reach out to patient on beetroot concern waiting for a response again.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't get a hold of nobody. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: It takes forever to get a hold of anybody to talk to them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so let me read what the doctor said.\n\nSpeaker 1: It said, hello, the pharmacy would like to confirm that you will discontinue taking beetroot before starting Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: As the combination can cause potential interactions and cause a serious decrease in blood pressure.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy cannot ship the order until it is confirmed.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then there's another note sent to you yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, hello, the pharmacy would like to confirm that you will discontinue taking beetroot.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then, yeah, just the same thing as before.\n\nSpeaker 1: They cannot because of the interaction with the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So do you agree to stop taking the beetroot?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do I? Yes, I will. I mean, I'd like to try that. I was hoping to be here by Thursday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's the only thing that's been to hold up is they wanted a response from you,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I can reply on your behalf and let the doctor know that you've agreed to stop taking the beetroot\n\nSpeaker 2: while you're taking the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I just don't take the beetroot when I take the Viagra or stop it completely?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would say stop it completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, the other Viagra, there's no problem with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one I get from my doctor, but this, you got something different?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know why they're saying that there could be a combination, but it has to do with your blood pressure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, all right, well, then I'll quit. I mean, I've been paid for it. I need to get it, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'd like to try it, but I mean, I was supposed to try it on Thursday, but that ain't going to work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, okay, so they'll ship it out today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I'm replying on your behalf that you're going to stop taking the beetroot,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'm going to message the following week that they'll release that hold and ship it out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but it'll be shipped today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it will.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it takes three to five days?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, best scenario would be Friday?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm going to ask them to expedite it and ship it out to you today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, hopefully you'll get it by Friday.\n\nSpeaker 1: My God, how come it's so hard to get a hold of you guys?\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, especially in the mornings. We've just been so busy because the AGD has been in such high demand.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I do apologize. I had a customer on the line before you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I saw that you were in the queue on my extension, and I just could not get off the phone with him.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I do apologize for that, but I've gone ahead and taken care of that for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me ask you another question.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've tried to log in. I've tried to log in, and it wouldn't let me log in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there – I have – it's casinodavidcox.net.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I want to log in to –\n\nSpeaker 1: casinodavidatcox.net, yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not David, just Casino Dave.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, nope. I have Casino David. Let me change it to Casino Dave.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, let's go to Casino Dave, because that's where the problem's been.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, casinodavidatcox.net.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now I should be able to log in?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I have to or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, casinodavidatcox.net.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just sent you a link to be able to log in.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we're good, then. I'm going to get it shipped out today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. You are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Well, I didn't take it today, so I guess I'm good, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right. Bye.",
