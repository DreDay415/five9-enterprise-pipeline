I ordered the AVG, the AGV Viagra online, and that's not what I received.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not what I received in the mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: I received the generic Viagra, and I spoke with someone concerned in it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and they assured me that they would take care of it\n\nSpeaker 2: and contact the pharmacy and send me the correct item.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that has not happened either, and I'm very dissatisfied.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Full name is Walter Lynch. Date of birth is 5-16-66.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Walter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yes, so it looks like you did speak to an agent on the 3rd.\n\nSpeaker 2: He did send you the correct Viagra for free.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what you received on the mail is the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you take a look at the pills, you should be able to confirm this\n\nSpeaker 1: because the pills will have the number 100 engraved on them.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you will be able to tell.\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't received them. First of all, I haven't received them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Second of all, he told me that the ones that I get should have the AGV on them.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to be the AGV on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have the number 100 engraved on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then your order got delivered on the 9th.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I didn't receive anything on the 9th.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is your shipping address 1829 Kribuk Drive, Bissonnier, Alabama, 35022?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, it got delivered on your mailbox at 6:21 p.m. on February 9th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I have to check and see if someone else got it out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, check your mailbox, but it was delivered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so he just sent you the AGV, so check.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, have a nice day.
