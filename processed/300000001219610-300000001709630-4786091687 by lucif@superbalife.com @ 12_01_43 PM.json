Is your last name Gay, Mr. Gay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, Kelton Gay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sir. So I do see you are a VIP with us here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you mind if I ask why it is that you want to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've kind of come into some heart issues, and I can't take it no more.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's no need in getting it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, we can just not bill you or ship this to you for a while, sir, even like six months,\n\nSpeaker 2: and give us some time maybe that you're cleared to continue with this down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't foresee that ever happening anymore, boss, so I guess we might as well shut it down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'll do that for you, sir. Anything else that you need?\n\nSpeaker 1: Nope. Is there some way or another you can send me an e-mail or statement that this has been done?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just a verbal confirmation, sir, that your prescription is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's all I need. All right. Well, I do appreciate it. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. You have a good day.",
