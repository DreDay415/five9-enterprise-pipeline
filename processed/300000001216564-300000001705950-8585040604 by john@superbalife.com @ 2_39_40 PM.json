    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is John, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, John, I got an email back from Christy out of your office, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had sent a letter about an order I just received.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It clearly was not what I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I can get your name and zip code, I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure, it's Anthony Frost, 92120.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Anthony, I'll be able to help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you need a request number?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't need that. I'll be able to see everything I need to see.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I was just going to say I'll be able to help get this fixed for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I see your email here, and I see what the pill looks like, which is what I would ask you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yes, you got the wrong thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're going to get you 80 pills, sir, of the right stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where you saw on your bottle or your pill itself, it said AC340.\n\nSpeaker 1: This one is going to say 100 and only 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The label should also be updated to say AGV on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if all else fails, it will say 100 on the pill, which will indicate it is for sure the right pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: My question to you is, you know, you advertise this different type of pill as being something that is better,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's faster, it lasts 14 hours, you know, it does all these wonderful things.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is any of that true, or is it literally just silence on these insane stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, so Denafil is in it because that's the active ingredient in even the brand name Blue Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is different in the sense because it's made to a higher standard and quality level.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the one that was sent to you, that's an American generic made by a company that's based out of New Jersey.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not like it's bad by any means, but it just meets the basic standards, which is to be 80% the same as the original.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one I'm about to fix for you and send out to you is made by the original manufacturers to their same specifications and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's like you're getting something as good, if not even a little better,\n\nSpeaker 2: because they've been able to refine the formulation as the Blue Pill without having to pay those Blue Pill costs.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it is a better pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Will it actually, you know, typically the standard stuff lasts for maybe four hours, if you're lucky, and takes an hour to activate.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, your claim is that this new one is much faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: It takes about 11 minutes, it says, I'm not sure I believe it, and lasts for 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that true or is that just a little bit of exaggeration?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't speak to the extremes on those, but I have had people tell me that it works within 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's something I've heard from multiple people.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then in terms of how long it lasts, I have heard people, or I've had people tell me they've had it last like 8, 10 hours maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1: So maybe not 14, but much longer than the normal.\n\nSpeaker 2: I remember a gentleman recently told me he had a day where he was able to have sex in the morning, so he took the pill,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then later he came home and it was like 5, 6 hours, 8 hours later, whatever it was,\n\nSpeaker 2: and was able to go again without having to take a second pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So based on the testimony I'll get from people reordering, it does definitely work faster and longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'd appreciate it if you could send what was supposed to be, and do you think that'll take about, what, about a week to get to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it should ship out on Monday for you, just because of the timing today.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, it should be shipped out on Monday and to you by the end of next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what do you want me to do with the existing ones?\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want me to mail them back?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to, but you're not required to.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are FDA approved, safe to take, so if you want them as like a backup plan, you can.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to toss them, you can.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to return them, we will take them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just up to what you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I won't worry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just wait for the new ones, and hopefully maybe by the end of next week it'll show up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and one last thing I want to let you know, Anthony, is that, so,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to get an email like you got before with tracking and all that kind of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to say on the, like, there's technically a receipt, because I put it through as a $0 transaction,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can get those tracking updates, but it's going to say 40 on your receipt.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've messaged the pharmacy specifically to send 80.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't have a way to put in for 80 pills like you did on the first order,\n\nSpeaker 1: so I just don't want you to be worried if you see that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You will get 80 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I appreciate you taking the call and explaining all this to me,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's making me feel a little better, so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I understand.\n\nSpeaker 2: You get a little wary online and all these claims, I get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we sell both kinds of Viagra, so somewhere there was a mix-up, obviously.\n\nSpeaker 2: Obviously not what we want to have happen, but I'm happy I was able to get it fixed for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.",
