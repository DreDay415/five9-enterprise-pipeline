    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I want to talk about getting a refill. Can you look me up? My name, number, whatever you need from me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. What is your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Michael McCoy, and McCoy is M-C-K-O-Y. Date of birth is 3-13-1959.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Michael.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And you want to place another order?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I want to see what other ones. Now, is it possible to go to the hundreds, or do I have to go see the doctor again?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. If you want 100 milligrams, you can always adjust it to the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it looks like last time you purchased 10 pills. Do you want that same refill, or do you want to get 25 pills this time?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I understand. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So how much? Can you give me a price right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. So we have 10 for 49, a quantity of 25 for 99, or a quantity of 40 for 149.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I can get the 25, then? And it would be the hundreds?\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 milligrams, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can do that. Is there any shipping in that, or is that included?\n\nSpeaker 2: Shipping is free.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then is your shipping address still the same, Michael, 8849 Macadamia Lane, Panama City Beach, Florida, 32413?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. I just want to make sure you have the right card on file, because I changed my American Express to the Capital One.\n\nSpeaker 1: And look, we have a MasterCard ending in 3741.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. You're all set, Michael. I was able to successfully place that order for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should be receiving it within the next three to five business days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Very good. Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Have a good day. Bye, Michael.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
