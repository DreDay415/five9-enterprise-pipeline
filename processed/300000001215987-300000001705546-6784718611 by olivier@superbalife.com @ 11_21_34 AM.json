    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Yes, sir. My name is Mike Haynes, H-A-M-E-S. Yes. Right around Christmastime.\n\nSpeaker 2: I ordered what was supposed to be the S-G or S-B or whatever it is. And they sent me—\n\nSpeaker 1: the wrong pills. They sent me just the regular generic Viagra or whatever it is. Okay. So—\n\nSpeaker 2: I got those, but then they turned around and sent me the right ones. The problem is the—\n\nSpeaker 1: right ones are, the whole thing is a scam as far as I can figure. Because first of all—\n\nSpeaker 2: it didn't do anything for me that a generic 100mg Viagra would do. There's no difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the pill even had 100 stamped on the pill. It didn't increase my size or it didn't do—\n\nSpeaker 2: anything. Okay. So I talked to a lady and she said send both pills back. And I did so.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it says that y'all received them. And it said that I needed to call this number—\n\nSpeaker 2: to get the refund, I guess. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Mr. Mike Haynes?\n\nSpeaker 2: Haynes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you repackage it or did you send it in the same package it came with? The pills are in a pill bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yes. And I took both pill bottles and I put them in a package at the UPS store.\n\nSpeaker 1: May I have the tracking number for that package?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on a minute. Okay. The tracking number was 9500-1105-6822-6015-0622-29. You already received them. I mean, I've got the—it shows—\n\nSpeaker 1: on here and I've got the email that you sent saying that you received them.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. Perfect. So I see. So I'm going to proceed with your refund. But you know, just for clarification—\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Ames, you know, everybody has their own problem with ED. You know, if the med didn't—\n\nSpeaker 2: work for you. I understand. It may, it may—for me it was just a con. That's all I can—\n\nSpeaker 1: tell you. For me it was just a con. But if it works for other people, that's great. It—\n\nSpeaker 2: doesn't mean it's a scam. I just want to clarify on that, you know. Every med is not for everybody.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you have your own system, you have your own history, you know. Things can be—\n\nSpeaker 2: different for you, but it works for a lot of people as well, you know. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you make money however you get, if you can con people out of their money, go for—\n\nSpeaker 2: it. I just, for me personally, it's a con. But I understand you don't see it that way—\n\nSpeaker 1: and you've got people that, maybe it does something for them. I don't know, but—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it works for a lot of people. It works for a lot of people. We wouldn't be here anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah. I mean, it's just, you can put anything on the internet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but at some point it won't last long, you know. It costs money to maintain a business—\n\nSpeaker 1: like that. So if people are not happy, they're not buying at some point of time. So I can—\n\nSpeaker 2: ensure it works for a lot of people, but now you have your own issue, you know. I understand—\n\nSpeaker 1: it didn't work for you. We wish it would have worked for you, so we would have kept you—\n\nSpeaker 2: as an important customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand. Believe me, if it had done one-third of what it said it could do, I wouldn't be—\n\nSpeaker 2: using it. But I've got Levitra that I use, and Levitra's ten times better than this stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's also one of the reasons, sir. So when you get, those meds work a different way—\n\nSpeaker 2: where they have different biochemistry mechanisms.\n\nSpeaker 1: I understand, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So sometimes the body is connected to the one that you've been taking and don't recognize—\n\nSpeaker 1: necessarily the other mechanism and might not work with it, you know what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's a big part of it, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do think that is a good part of it, because I'm sure that other people it works—\n\nSpeaker 2: good for, but for me, I get Levitra 60 milligrams and it's ten times better than that product.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's just me.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have a solution, that's what matters.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's right. And I would never know until I tried it, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly, you know, exactly. Some people have an easy body where they can try new stuff—\n\nSpeaker 2: anything kicks in. But some people also get attached to a certain prescription, so in—\n\nSpeaker 1: order for something else to work, you've got to take a long, long break from that medicine—\n\nSpeaker 2: you were taking, and then you've got to keep trying a new medicine, and then the body now—\n\nSpeaker 1: recognize the way it works and activate that way, you know. But switch back and forth usually—\n\nSpeaker 2: don't necessarily work, because your body gets attached. Those medicines don't work—\n\nSpeaker 1: the same way, even though they're for ED, they work differently, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think that's right, yeah. I agree with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, but I'm glad that you have a solution for ED, because that's what we're here for—\n\nSpeaker 2: at the end of the day, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you're able to have some things going on, we're happy for you, definitely. And yeah—\n\nSpeaker 1: and I've refunded you also the $63.95, okay? And I'm going to close your account here—\n\nSpeaker 2: everything is canceled, and then you get your $63.95 back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you refund it? How did you send the refund? Do you refund it to my card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, the payment method that you use, we don't have any other method to use, so we just resend—\n\nSpeaker 1: that to where it came from, which is the card you used.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, what number was on the card?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me check here.\n\nSpeaker 2: The last four digits.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was 7498, 7498.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's the one I need, yeah. All righty. Well, super good. Thank you, sir, and you—\n\nSpeaker 1: have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, bye-bye.",
