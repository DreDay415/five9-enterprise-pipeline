I'm calling about my account and the order you sent Staten Island.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been trying to cancel it since 4-27 when I first received it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Antonio Lewis in Lafayette, Louisiana?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Gotcha. Okay. So, Antonio, it looks like you did call in on the 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are a VIP member here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe the last gentleman you spoke with mentioned that you're able to pause everything for six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, back then, that would have been six months as of today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you still just not ready for any product at the moment?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm no longer using those products.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not using them? Okay. Was there an issue with them?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, just medical reasons.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just medical issues? Okay. Gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Boom. Okay. So, this hasn't gone out yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me reverse it right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then everything else is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good luck with your health, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. So, I would no longer be getting charged for anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, nothing. And then this one just got reversed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, it should hit your account in a couple of days, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
