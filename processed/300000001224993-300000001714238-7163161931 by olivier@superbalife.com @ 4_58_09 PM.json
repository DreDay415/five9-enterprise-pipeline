    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello? Hello, Mr. Ares? Yes. Yeah, this is Skoa Blue, Viagra Skoa Blue. Uh, you just\n\nSpeaker 2: said we couldn't reach each other. Yeah, how can I help you, sir? Yes, uh, I had, I had\n\nSpeaker 1: ordered about maybe a month ago or so like that, but I had a house fire in my house and\n\nSpeaker 2: shit got destroyed, man. So I need to order again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Sorry to hear that. Uh, you want to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, man. The same quantity?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay. Uh, okay. Let me see, uh, if the\n\nSpeaker 2: pharmacy let me, they probably would be okay with 25 or 10, but we can try to place the\n\nSpeaker 1: 40 pills because there was a lot. Because I, I never, I only got to use like a few of\n\nSpeaker 2: them after the fire. I could, they were destroyed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. I couldn't use none. They, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: they were destroyed. I, you know what I mean? I used about maybe four or five of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then we had to, Oh yeah, we're fine. Everybody got out of the fire, but my house is messed up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to get my house repaired.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh wow. Wow. Yeah. My, my brother, my brother has dementia\n\nSpeaker 1: and he didn't, he didn't mean to set the fire, but he did. And now we're out of a home and,\n\nSpeaker 2: but I got my brother placed in a nursing home now. So yeah, but everything, everything got,\n\nSpeaker 1: fuck, everything got destroyed, man. So, you know, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm placing your order here and I'm going to message the pharmacy that, you know, you lost\n\nSpeaker 1: your pill. If they can ship, even though we, uh, we still under the limitation as far as\n\nSpeaker 2: right. I, I, I, I, I knew, I knew that. Yeah, I knew that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. But I figured since I had,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, I didn't, I only got to use five with a pill. Shit. That makes sense. And you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you still want to keep the same address even though it's burned. You okay. The box mailbox\n\nSpeaker 2: is okay to use for sending.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. The mailbox is okay to use.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Let me process\n\nSpeaker 2: here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, he got declined.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I figured that. Fuck. Damn it. Damn, man. You can't tell him I\n\nSpeaker 1: had my house fired. They don't care about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, shit. No, you got to place an order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, you know, they're not going to ship.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, we already even out of the limitation for legally\n\nSpeaker 1: send you more, even you pay. So they're not going to send out for me. You can place an order for 10\n\nSpeaker 2: if you want.\n\nSpeaker 1: Damn. Yeah. How much is 10?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's 49. So we come to 63, 95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Holy shit, man. I only paid 140 for 40 of them. Like, damn, that's a bad, that's a,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's not a great deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Usually better to get more, uh, in order to, uh,\n\nSpeaker 2: yeah, that's what I usually did. Cause that's not a great deal, man. 10 for 60. Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it. Damn it, man. Shit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Shit. Oh, fuck. When is my order? I can't place another order to the 40 to win.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you can place today, but he got declined.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I got declined. So they're not going to send\n\nSpeaker 1: them to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: So no, no, no, no, no. It's declined because of the bank. Not because of them. The\n\nSpeaker 1: credit card, maybe you have a safety. That's probably why it's about the whole.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the bank,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think your credit card didn't want to write a transaction.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, let me give you another credit\n\nSpeaker 1: card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me give you another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I can't work. Can I give you to get you to get you\n\nSpeaker 1: the order, but he got declined. That's the credit card information.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, well, let me,\n\nSpeaker 1: but let me, let me order a 40. I got another card. I could put them on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you ready?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Hold on for a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You ready for the card number?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Five, four, four, nine,\n\nSpeaker 1: two, seven, two, eight.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2670 and 3806.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me say that one more time. Five, four, four, nine, two, seven, two, eight, two, six,\n\nSpeaker 1: 70, three, eight, zero six.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Expiration date.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: 1228.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1228. And according to back\n\nSpeaker 2: nine, nine, eight.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. Let me place your order. I'm on a message to pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, yeah. I mentioned it to him. That's my, I had a house fire. Yeah. And my shit got,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, it got destroyed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah. I'm going to try to push for you to get you older.\n\nSpeaker 1: Boom. I was able to process the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Uh, now, uh, let me, let me contact the pharmacy. I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: going to contact the pharmacy shortly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Um, when they,\n\nSpeaker 1: okay, perfect. The order number got created\n\nSpeaker 2: now, but on this card, that's the only order I want to place on this card.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And you want, you want me to put the other card on file right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Put my other card on file. Not this one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So we're going to put another card right\n\nSpeaker 2: now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, because, but I mean, I wanted to, I'm gonna pay with this card that we just did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. We already did the payment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Great. Great. Great. But put,\n\nSpeaker 2: put my other card on file cause I just got to fill it back up. That's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, uh, the 95 Drexel is fine. That's it'll still go in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you're not. Yeah, I got it on. Okay, and then what would be the new payment information?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm ready when you are.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean? The card that you want to use moving forward,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I'm going to replace you. We already charged the other card. That's fine. Now we're putting\n\nSpeaker 1: a card for the future. So that card is not going to be used, but we're going to put the card that\n\nSpeaker 2: you want to use.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah, right. The other one that you're, it's just my other card that I\n\nSpeaker 2: just got to refill it. That's all. But just give me that card because when I swap card, because we\n\nSpeaker 1: use another card, the other card disappears. So we don't have it anymore. So we got to reorder it\n\nSpeaker 2: for the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, it's nothing on it now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'm gonna give it to you. 5102.\n\nSpeaker 1: 61. I mean, you can do that. Now you want to do that next time. It's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, we can do it next time then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, we can do it next time. All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you said that message the pharmacy, hopefully they okay. I told them you had an issue,\n\nSpeaker 2: you lost your medicine. So right, they're able to ship that to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. You don't, is it going to be shipped? Did everything go through?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So let's say what you can do, you can call next week, if you have some time just to verify\n\nSpeaker 1: if they were able to ship the order, you know what I mean? Because right now, I will not know\n\nSpeaker 2: days later, when you come and check that we check and we see all the pharmacy still holding that,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, but right now we're not going to know. They're not going to tell us right away.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they took $140 off though, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, yes. So what they do, even when you get the payment,\n\nSpeaker 2: sometimes they hold, but what we're going to do, we're just going to push for you. So that's not\n\nSpeaker 1: a problem. When you call, you check, you remind us, we're going to check by already message them,\n\nSpeaker 2: telling them that you lost your meds. So sometimes as well, they're flexible, they just ship it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We're just going to push, but they're going to ship.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay. That's all we just\n\nSpeaker 1: going to have to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, yeah, but push it, push it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So I should get them about\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 days or so?\n\nSpeaker 2: Two to five business days. So if we're lucky, you can get it at the end of next\n\nSpeaker 1: week, but call maybe on, uh, on Monday. So, uh, I can check with the pharmacy again on Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'll call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll call you. You call again. You're looking for it because you lost it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. My brother. Thank you. All set. You have a good\n\nSpeaker 1: weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. You too. Bye-bye.",
