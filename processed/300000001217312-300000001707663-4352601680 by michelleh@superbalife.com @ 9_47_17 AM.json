    "text": "Speaker 1: Good morning, thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I ordered from you guys and I got the wrong subscription and I talked to a guy and he—\n\nSpeaker 1: Said, oh, yes, you got the wrong subscription, we'll send you the right one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi Mike, can I just have you confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 7-1-56.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, he sent you the exact same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: He did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I see that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me a second, that's ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you remember his name?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I do not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, what, I mean, I'll just give you a second, then I would like to ask you a question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to send you 100 milligrams as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'm going to, hold on, okay, there we go.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm sending out 100 milligrams instead of 50, so when you get this bottle, this is—\n\nSpeaker 2: How you're going to tell the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: On the bottle, it's going to say, under AGV, it's going to say Greenstone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then on the pills, the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are the two ways you can confirm you received the FDA-approved Pfizer-Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because right now, your pills have AC imprinted on them, followed by, like, 390.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then on the bottle, it says APTO.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can just go ahead and throw those in the trash.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm sending you 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to send you 50, actually.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, wait, 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: You paid for one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't believe they sent you the wrong stuff twice.\n\nSpeaker 2: I apologize for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on, because this is, let's see, how many are in these?\n\nSpeaker 2: I thought I bought more than, I don't know what I bought anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: You bought a quantity of 25 for $113.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then he sent you 25 of the same stuff thrown out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm sending you, I upped it to 100 milligrams, and I'm sending you 25 of the correct AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what I'm going to do, I'm going to pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way it keeps your profile open and allows the pharmacy to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I'm going to give you my extension so you can call me back and let me know how the AGV works out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that way you don't have to sit on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll just go to the top of my call list.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't believe they sent you the same stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: What the heck?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, you know what that does?\n\nSpeaker 1: That makes me go, okay, I'm getting scammed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly what, like, I'm like, oh, shoot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, I called this, because I've had that, like, I'm somewhat, pardon?\n\nSpeaker 1: I would think this is bullshit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, like, I'm like, okay, I'm getting scammed.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's, like, in the last year, so I'm somewhat challenged, like, as far as computers and high-tech stuff goes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I don't know any of that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, I've had to change my credit card a couple times because, like, I was getting kind of scammed.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm like, oh, shit, I'm getting scammed again.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it just kind of, and I'm just going to ask one time, and you've already upped it, but you, like, this is kind of BS.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, you should send me 50.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, just give me a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I can't change this now, but give me a call back when you get those, and I'll send you some more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because, yeah, I'm just like, oh, my God.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're going to give me your name and number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Same phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: My extension is 0020.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0020?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to make a note to the pharmacy to put a total quantity of 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if there's not 50 in there, give me a call back, let me know, so I can send you out the additional.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the female of me.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm Michael.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's not cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm just—\n\nSpeaker 2: Trust me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sending you the correct stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, like, what I was buying, it said, like, it was FDA approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it looked like they were coded, and there was, like, letters on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm just getting these little white things that say 029.\n\nSpeaker 2: They probably say AC390 on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's just generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just throw those away.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this pill is going to be white, triangle shape, and the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will not say AGV on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will say AGV on the bottle and Greenstone, and Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's manufacturer in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So these are the real things you're going to tell me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, the real things.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll leave you with a pretty good joke.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me hear it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this Thanksgiving, I decided to make big changes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I decided I was no longer going to eat Thanksgiving leftovers.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was pretty tough, but I just quit cold turkey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, that's funny.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to use that today.\n\nSpeaker 2: You want my Christmas one?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: What did one snowman ask the other?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know what.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you smell carrots?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, those are funny.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are cute ones, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm still going to use those.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you smell carrots?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So where are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just curious.\n\nSpeaker 2: Where are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's really nice to hear no accent.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not from India.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're in Los Angeles, and then our farmer's season, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope this time it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have my number, so give me a call back, and that way you don't have to sit on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, but no problem, Mike.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for the laugh.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye.",
