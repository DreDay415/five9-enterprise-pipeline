    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Could you help me out here?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I have ordered from you guys before, and I went online to my account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and there's this little box where you can go to your prescriptions,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it says what you're going to order is exactly what you had last time,\n\nSpeaker 1: just push this button, which I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it was 60 pills at 100 milligrams for $79.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you guys sent to a charge of $95 that got declined.\n\nSpeaker 2: So why does that happen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it more than 60 pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: The correct price you should be paying is $88.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: You started with us in 2024, it looks like.\n\nSpeaker 2: This was James, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so you should be paying $88.95 for these pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you saw that $79 price point, like when you first ordered,\n\nSpeaker 1: that's the price for the pills, and then we use a third-party pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: so they charge us a pharmacy fee.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what we call false advertising.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can't do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why does it say $79 if it's not $79?\n\nSpeaker 2: So the pills are $79, the pharmacy is a third-party,\n\nSpeaker 1: so it's technically not us that's charging it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So then the pills aren't $79 because you have to get them from your pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if that's how you want to interpret it, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I guess you could say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, interpret it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do they call that?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a bait-and-switch.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been in sales for a long time.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're getting these pills at an insanely good rate.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know, that's not true.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyway, that's your pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a great rate.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there any way I can get the $79?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can charge you $10 less because we've charged you $10 more on the first pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: or we charged you $5 more on the last two orders, so that would be $78.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's just because we overcharged you on the other pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: The correct price is $88.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you wanted to place orders in the future, it would be that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you're calling and saying, hey, you guys bait-and-switched me,\n\nSpeaker 1: I will give you that discount, of course,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you should have been at the rate of $88.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you did pay that $88.95 like two years ago,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're just calling to tell us about it like now.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like, come on.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted to place an order today, that is no issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do want to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what would the total be now?\n\nSpeaker 2: $78.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's not so bad.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that includes shipping and everything?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the total price out the door.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, do I have to place that order with you now, or do I do it online again?\n\nSpeaker 2: I can do that for you over the phone to make sure it goes through correctly.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can we do that, but I'm going to use the same credit card\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if the Apple or something or other.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I don't have any credit on there for these specific instances.\n\nSpeaker 1: So give me about ten minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's place that order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll give you about ten minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us right back whenever you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: The profile will be noted down.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you give me ten minutes, there will be sufficient credit there for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just give us a call right back.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll take care of it as soon as you call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why is that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Why do I have to call back?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because we don't like to process orders, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: when customers just say it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, if it was, like, set up at a certain date, that's fine,\n\nSpeaker 2: an agreed-upon time and date.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you say, hey, let's place it in 20 minutes, I want to just be safe.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want anything to go awry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can order it with you now and just have you process it tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you order it, that's when it will process.\n\nSpeaker 2: So whenever you're ready, you know, whenever the money is on the card,\n\nSpeaker 1: just call us back just so we avoid any confusion,\n\nSpeaker 2: so everything is done correctly the right way.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what, it takes about three minutes to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you give me three minutes?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just call us right back, just because we do have a few more people in the queue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll call you back and we'll take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.",
