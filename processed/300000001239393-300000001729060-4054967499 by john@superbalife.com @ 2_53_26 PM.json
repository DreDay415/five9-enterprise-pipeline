    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I was trying to incur on the new Viagra that you are selling.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you with that. What kind of questions can I help you with?\n\nSpeaker 2: Does it still give you all the headaches and all the stuff that the original Viagra did?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's still a possibility. However, the AGV is better about decreased chances and having the side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've talked to multiple people that used to get headaches and they've tried this and they don't get them with the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does it work better than the old stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: From the feedback I've gotten from customers, yes, it does. It works better than that, too.\n\nSpeaker 1: I personally haven't taken it, so I can't say for certain from my own experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: But our customers tell me, yes, it works better than the stuff they've taken before.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the cost on the new stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: So there's three options. And you're a returning customer, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah. I'm just trying to pull up your account. Is this Randy?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. So yeah, there's three options. There's 40 pills. That's $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's 25 pills for $113 or 10 for $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: You talk like you knew me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me try the 10 before I do anything else. The other stuff don't work with crap.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, that sounds reasonable to me to get 10 to see how it goes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you still at the Meadowview Drive address?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and do you want the 10 and 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: I assume whatever the most potent dose is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that is the most potent dose, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it looks like you updated your card. Is it this Visa that ends in 3838 you want me to use?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'll go ahead and put your order through. Give me one second.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, but I don't want this where the last time I ordered stuff, they kept sending stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want this to be a one-time order unless something's done different.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I can do that, sir, but it may be difficult to reorder if you want it down the road.\n\nSpeaker 2: What I can do as an alternative for you is put through the order today and put a six-month hold on the account,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you just have to let us know after you've tried it what you want to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now let's just do it for just a one-time order. I'll deal with whatever though.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so we're all set. It'll just be this one time that you can order it then.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't control it on my own.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set, sir. It'll update your prescription, and we'll mail it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long will it take to get it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Five to seven days from today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thank you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
