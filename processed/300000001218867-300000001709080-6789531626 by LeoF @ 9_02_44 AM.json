It's at the pharmacy still.\n\nSpeaker 2: We do next day air for $38.\n\nSpeaker 1: It would go out today most likely and arrive tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: We do two day air for $28 and priority mail for $15.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so we don't know what time it would arrive tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I could not. I definitely couldn't give you that FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 1: They do what they will.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so it would be FedEx then?\n\nSpeaker 1: If it was next day air or second day air.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it's priority mail, one to three days with USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I guess let's just keep it the way that it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem. You should still see that arrive by Friday, I'd say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, cool.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. I appreciate you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
