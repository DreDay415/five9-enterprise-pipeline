    "text": "Speaker 1: Good morning. Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I was online a couple of months ago, and we were messing around.\n\nSpeaker 1: We saw that score blue thing, whatever it's called.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried to fill it out, and we decided to cancel it, and we did.\n\nSpeaker 1: And all of a sudden, in December, I get a receipt from you guys for 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's $63.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I get another one the other day.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says recurring prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't recur it. I canceled the whole thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't even finish filling out the end of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can help you out. Nick, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: 08-1956.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see your VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it looks like you signed up on December 19th.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we didn't even finish filling the whole form out, and we said,\n\nSpeaker 1: let's cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And a month later, I get a thing in the mail with 10 little pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, yeah, if you don't, then what you can do,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can go ahead and cancel you out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you just have to return those two bottles,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we can get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I have to mail this back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just can't cancel it right now and reverse the charges on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or do I have to call the bank and have them reverse it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I canceled you out, but you received the product,\n\nSpeaker 2: so we need that back in order for a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can't just give you a free product and issue you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you just write return to sender on the – do you have the envelope still?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure what I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's in the bedroom someplace.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have that envelope, you can just put both those bottles in there,\n\nSpeaker 2: tape it up, and write return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you don't have to pay for postage,\n\nSpeaker 2: and there's already a tracking number on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why would they put a recurring subscription, a monthly subscription?\n\nSpeaker 2: I never even checked that box.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, a quantity of 10, the doctor just puts you on automatic refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: which you don't have to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: A lot of people just like to go ahead and put a six-month pause on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and allows you to call in for a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick, how is the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I took one pill and it wasn't any difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't have a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're just messing around.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's try this Scor-Blue shit, see how it's advertising all over the place.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have the pills on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you tell me what's imprinted on the individual pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: The pill's not even blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's not going to be blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will be white.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I want to know if it says AC on there.\n\nSpeaker 2: What does that mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: If it says AC, that means it's generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: They sent you the wrong ones.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm trying to find out.\n\nSpeaker 2: For $47 they sent me the wrong one?\n\nSpeaker 1: On the individual pill, what's imprinted on it?\n\nSpeaker 2: There's nothing imprinted on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't say AC, 390 or 340?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, let me get my magnifying glass out.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is AC 34.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's what I thought.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the pharmacy sent you actually just regular generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: You did not receive the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to get you out a replacement, and then I'm going to tell you how you—\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't want a replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want it canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, I went ahead and canceled you out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the address is actually on the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's Go-Go Meds 525 Alexandria Pike in Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you just ship it back to there, then we can go ahead and issue those two refunds.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I have to spend money to send it back to you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we don't send return labels.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, why would they do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: In the first place, they sent me the wrong pill.",
