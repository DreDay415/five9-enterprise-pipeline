How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I received a prescription in the mail as far as a renewal, and I never asked for a renewal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What's your name and your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Mark Perez, 3/26/63.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Perez, I do see that you have a prescription with us for the 50 milligrams of the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it looks like the doctor did write your prescription with refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why you received another prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't ask for refills, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, the first time I used it, why would I ask for refills?\n\nSpeaker 1: None of those are going to be any good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that's how telehealth companies, that's industry standard that the prescription doesn't come with refills\n\nSpeaker 1: unless you call us to cancel everything entirely.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I didn't say that when I signed up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Regardless, I don't want refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Do you not plan on taking it down the line?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you're not obligated to get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I need it, I will renew it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will get another prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll go ahead and cancel everything out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just know that you'll have to restart again, and then the next time the doctor fee won't be covered.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I've gone ahead and canceled it for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome. Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye.",
