    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, hey, I was calling. I asked you guys. They charged my account yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't even know I was still signed up with you all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can assist you. Can I get your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure. My name is Fasanti Veils, and the date of birth is 1-24-64.\n\nSpeaker 2: One second.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir. I have your account here. I do see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, this most current order is still at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: It hasn't shipped out yet, so I can go ahead and put a stop to that\n\nSpeaker 2: and issue a refund for that charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just wanted you to know that we are a telehealth, not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can actually, as our VIP status customer,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can set up your account however you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can modify the frequency or quantity.\n\nSpeaker 1: Also put a pause on your account at any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not locked into any monthly fees or to receive your refills on a monthly basis.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can go ahead and modify and adjust that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That would be great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. How did you like the results with the AGV Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's the same as the other stuff to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I don't see any need to pay more when I can get the other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, they're still doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the one for AGV, I still never received them saying AGV on it, first of all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me clarify that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I had an issue before when I received them.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first time that I paid for them, they didn't work any better than the other one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you guys sent me $25 free of charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried that same shit, did nothing really.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it was no better than the cheaper stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's why it caught me totally by surprise that you guys hit my account yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you read to me that replacement order that we sent you?\n\nSpeaker 1: What does it say on it, on the pill?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to make sure that they didn't send you the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it didn't say AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't say AGV at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: In fact, hang on a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says, it says it's the Cytaminophil 100 milligram tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV is what the bottle says.\n\nSpeaker 2: Generic for Viagra is what it says on here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and what does it say on the tablet, if you pull one out?\n\nSpeaker 2: Nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, it doesn't say anything on the tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't have anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just had the shape of the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: It didn't have any writing on it, but it was shaped like the Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: opposed to those other ones that I get.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you still have one?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because there's no way I can confirm that you, in fact, got the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because the AGV didn't say 100 on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I think they did.\n\nSpeaker 2: They might have said 100, but they still 100 of the generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's still generic, though, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is, but it's the new and improved generic.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's made in the same lab by the same manufacturer as the branded Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: except you get it at a better cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: We also sell the branded Viagra, but it's $100 a tablet.\n\nSpeaker 2: So with the AGV, I've spoken to customers.\n\nSpeaker 1: It works just as well, except you're getting it at a more reasonable rate\n\nSpeaker 2: than you would for paying for the branded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, they've made modifications to the inactive ingredients\n\nSpeaker 2: and the delivery mechanism and how it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you are taking it on an empty stomach and not drinking alcohol on it,\n\nSpeaker 2: you should notice a huge improvement in the new AGV and how it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you do take it with a full meal, it's not going to work as intended.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, not really sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it did work for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other ones worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have those issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it worked the same as the cheaper thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: There was no benefit for me in that, in going that route,\n\nSpeaker 2: paying more for what was supposed to be 100 milligrams of the better upgraded stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: That shit didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, I ain't got no reason to lie to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm canceling the subscription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know where you're going with this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I just wanted to make sure that you had gotten the correct AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: because you mentioned it didn't work or it worked the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just wanted to ensure that you had, in fact, received the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'll go ahead and cancel your account, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
