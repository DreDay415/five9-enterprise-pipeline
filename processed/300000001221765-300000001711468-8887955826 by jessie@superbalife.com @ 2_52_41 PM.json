    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling customer support at Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Eric Melgren.\n\nSpeaker 1: Eric Melgren.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Melgren, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 1: 67201.\n\nSpeaker 2: 67201.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: We still receive your mail at P.O.\n\nSpeaker 1: Box 1579 in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nSpeaker 2: 67201.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: You wanted to speak with a supervisor,\n\nSpeaker 2: or is there something I can help you with?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called in yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got a medicine mailed to me from whoever it is that\n\nSpeaker 1: mails out your medicines.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a refill that I hadn't ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the last time you had sent me medicine,\n\nSpeaker 1: you had sent me the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so I called and talked to an agent.\n\nSpeaker 1: They ultimately transferred me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this Scor-Blue that I'm talking to now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I called and talked to somebody at Scor-Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: He was very helpful.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said, oh, well, I will correct\n\nSpeaker 2: that you wanted a different medicine than we sent you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll know you had a substitute\n\nSpeaker 2: where you got initially.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said, and if you mail this one back to Kentucky,\n\nSpeaker 2: then we'll reverse the charge for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I said, OK.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: They will not take medicine from me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: They will not mail prescription medicine\n\nSpeaker 2: from anyone except the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I said, well, how does the pharmacy mail it?\n\nSpeaker 2: The pharmacy is in Kentucky, and I'm here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And she was very helpful.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Melgar, I'm so sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can have someone send you or email you a tracking label.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that way, you don't have to be hassled with all of this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I apologize.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's usually not an issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we've checked that before.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it sounds like the mail person, whoever is there,\n\nSpeaker 2: is just hassling you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm happy to have someone email you a return label.\n\nSpeaker 2: This tracking label will indicate\n\nSpeaker 1: it's from the pharmacy or whatever then?\n\nSpeaker 2: It will indicate that it's going directly to the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, that's what my package says.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says it's going to the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: but they wouldn't take it from me.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's because that label, this is a new label.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's already been opened.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this would be a completely new label.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I put it in a new envelope.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it came in one of those nylon packages.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had to cut it open, to rip it open,\n\nSpeaker 2: to get it out to see what it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I put this in a new envelope.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I just took to the post office,\n\nSpeaker 1: was a new envelope with a pharmacy or whatever\n\nSpeaker 2: address in Kentucky to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's what they wouldn't take.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I can get an address label from you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it indicates it's a pharmacy shipment,\n\nSpeaker 2: I can buy another envelope to put that on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just trying to think how I avoid this problem again\n\nSpeaker 2: if I'm mailing it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The easiest thing to do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, the easiest thing to do is we can send you,\n\nSpeaker 1: we can have our team email you a new label.\n\nSpeaker 2: So don't worry with the one that you have.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can use the same envelope that you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it doesn't even matter about the envelope.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you don't need to take it to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just drop it off in a normal mail drop-off.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's it, honestly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the label will have already a posting computer on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be a fully paid label.\n\nSpeaker 2: OK, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: OK, all right, very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have my email address there?\n\nSpeaker 2: We sure do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have my email address?\n\nSpeaker 2: We do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have efmelgren, that's M-E-L-G-R-E-N, at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye.",
