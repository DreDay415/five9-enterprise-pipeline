    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I've had problems with headaches from taking ED pills, and I was just wondering, what's the smallest amount I can buy of the new Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: Mike, the lowest dose is 25 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: But what's recommended to take?\n\nSpeaker 1: It just depends. You know, you can take up to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you get headaches and you're a little apprehensive about taking it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can try half of that, split the pill in half, take a 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you get the 25s, I mean, that's always good to start with.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it just depends. I mean, start low.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you have some pills, cut one in half, see how it goes. You know, break that cycle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, what's the smallest amount I can buy?\n\nSpeaker 2: 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: 10 pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do most people use? How many milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 2: Everyone always gets the hundreds, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I guess you cut them in half if you need to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, everybody likes the strongest one, of course.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: How much is 10 of the 100 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: For 10 pills, it's $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I would like to try it, maybe.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have you heard of any people, any response?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it not as bad as giving you a headache as the old guys?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we're not hearing much about that at all, actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was your last name, sir? I'll see if you have an account or anything with us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Quick, Q-I-C-K.\n\nSpeaker 1: And your zip code, Mr. Quick?\n\nSpeaker 2: 37683.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you at 933 Sage Valley Circle?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, I can place an order for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says you placed an order on the 12th, actually, though, of this month.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says something should have been delivered on the 20th at 933 Sage Valley Circle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you get any of these pills already?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, to tell you the truth, the weather's bad here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did mail them to the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, check the post. I think you have some sitting out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you don't, call us back, and we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't know that order went through. I was just reading about it.\n\nSpeaker 2: No worries, no worries. Yep, so you're all set now. Just give us a call and we'll try them out.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Bye-bye now.",
