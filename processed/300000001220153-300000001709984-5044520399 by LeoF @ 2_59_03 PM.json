Um, I just want to, um, I'm curious about the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, what do you want to know?\n\nSpeaker 2: My guess, how much are they a pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh, so for 40 pills, it's $149. For 25 pills, it's $99, so it matters how many you get, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, what company, what's the name of the company that makes them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Viagra, Pfizer makes the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pfizer, so, I've been reading a little ad on them and, you know, and, um, they're better than the original Diamond Blue?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, they get high.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, what's the smallest, I mean, I'd like to try them first, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: The smallest amount you can get, it's $49, so $4.90 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay.

14 questions, they're multiple choice.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll read the questions, followed by the multiple choice answer choices.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you do hear an answer choice that applies to you, feel free to stop me and let me know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, it says, how long have you been concerned about or wanted to improve the size,\n\nSpeaker 1: hardness, duration, or power of

take them intermittently.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, this is something you take before sex, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I don't want to take something as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you don't have to take it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, have you ever consulted a doctor or counselor for personal sexual problems?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a urologist that used to prescribe and give me, I've known a urologist for about 25 years,\n\nSpeaker 2: for prostate enlargement, and in the beginning, he used to give me free samples of Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: of the real stuff, and even Cialis, when they gave him free samples in the beginning, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, and then the price got out of hand, and the generics just don't do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: They give me headaches.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I get you.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you said the urologist prescribed you Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you taken any of these other
