    "text": "Speaker 1: Viagra, I can help you today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, my name is William Kern.\n\nSpeaker 1: Presently, you guys are filling a prescription for me for Viagra or Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I'd like to stop my subscription from you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we can currently hear you.\n\nSpeaker 2: First order does need to arrive fully and ship out before we're able to cancel anything\n\nSpeaker 1: because that's what is needed to be sent.\n\nSpeaker 2: My first order is already shipped a long time ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: I pulled you up here, William Kern.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was shipped out on the 27th, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just got shipped.\n\nSpeaker 2: It needs to arrive to your home.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, the prescription can be canceled out.\n\nSpeaker 2: It needs to remain active until then.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you, though, is I'll just delay it out for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way, you don't have to worry about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just call us back after you try it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The thing is, once you do cancel these out, you won't be able to access them anymore\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to cancel it out, and I've already had the prescription for almost a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just made this order on the 24th.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I didn't place the order.\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys did.\n\nSpeaker 1: We did it because this is a brand-new account, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: How are we going to place a new order for a brand-new account?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's not a brand-new account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it is, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have an account that you made.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a brand-new one you made on 01-24-2026.\n\nSpeaker 1: You even took advantage of our pill quantity update, which is only for first-time patients,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you got that order shipped out.\n\nSpeaker 1: So on that case, you need to wait for that order to arrive,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you can call us back and make modifications.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I explained to you, I'll delay you out so that way you don't have to worry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You guys are not digging with Friday plans, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, we're not Friday plans, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're a completely different company.\n\nSpeaker 2: Friday plans, those folks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I already notified the company that I wanted to cancel this order.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got copies of the e-mails back to me canceling the order, successfully canceling.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't cancel through the e-mails, sir, so that's how I know that's not us.\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't cancel anything through e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all through phone because of HIPAA regulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm not sure what's funny, but we don't cancel through e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you guys ship out Friday or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just told you we don't ship out Friday plans.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are not Friday plans.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're the other company.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have got e-mails on my phone from the lady stating that your thing was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: I told her, do not bill my credit card.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do not send me the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: The thing is, you're not understanding.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the wrong company, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: There is no way.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I.\n\nSpeaker 1: You sent us an e-mail eight minutes ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Saying please deliver a billion of your products.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not one percent of the products you use.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I talked to.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't talk to anyone, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have all the e-mails pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You only sent us an e-mail eight minutes ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: And our system told you to call in, which is what you're doing now, I'm assuming.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you never got anything else saying the things that you're claiming you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can confirm that because I'm looking at all the e-mails.\n\nSpeaker 1: So look, I'm explaining to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you guys through Spartan Support?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we're not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who are you guys through then?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir, you called us.\n\nSpeaker 2: You put an order with Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: You made this order.\n\nSpeaker 2: You created it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you called us.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure exactly what.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I did not.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got an e-mail right here from Spartan Blue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who I have been through Spartan.\n\nSpeaker 2: Spartan Blue, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: We are not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you just said different names.\n\nSpeaker 1: You gave me Fridays.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you gave me a different name.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not order anything from you guys through Score Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you did.\n\nSpeaker 1: You even messaged the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't get an election.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't even write election.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put election for the past five years.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was all through Spartan Support.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have got the e-mail confirmations from Spartan Support.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are not Spartan Support, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I did not deal with your company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I don't understand exactly what they're trying to accomplish here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you need to submit quite a lot of information to get these orders approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you do this all at home.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you may have forgotten.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, my gosh.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did everything through Spartan Support.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not deal with your company unless you are through Spartan Support.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have got an e-mail right here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I suggest calling the right company because you're not talking to the right people right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I have got an e-mail from Julia right here.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have a Julia, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's how I already know you have completely wrong information.\n\nSpeaker 1: I keep trying to tell you you have the wrong company.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the wrong company, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have us confused.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, what your main goal is, but you have it all.\n\nSpeaker 1: My main goal is to stop your delivery and your billing to me of your product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you ordered one product from us, that product that shipped,\n\nSpeaker 1: that they refused the package for a refund because that package is already on its way to your house.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't just give away free products.\n\nSpeaker 1: And second of all, I'm going to keep trying to tell you when you spoke on the phone or e-mail,\n\nSpeaker 2: whatever you may have done, it was not us.\n\nSpeaker 1: What is the product that you are shipping?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sir, that's how I already know you're very confused on what you're doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't even know what you're purchasing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am asking you a simple question.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's by Agra, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell by Agra, and that's what you purchased from us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that means you're not even sure what you're doing right now because you don't even know the product that you're trying to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: I know exactly what I'm doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was dealing...\n\nSpeaker 2: Why didn't you ask me that question, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was dealing with art and support.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I keep trying to tell you, but there's no such thing as art and support of us.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure who you're speaking to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I have not dealt with your company.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then, okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Goodbye, sir.",
