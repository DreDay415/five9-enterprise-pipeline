Name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Joseph Nielsen, and that's 2-15-86.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, I see that you have a VIP account and a prescription from Dr. Williams\n\nSpeaker 1: for 25 tablets of Viagra 15 milligram.\n\nSpeaker 2: How can I help you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I have that prescription cancelled, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: You just don't need a refill? Do you want to order as needed instead?\n\nSpeaker 1: Or do you have any health concerns?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have enough, so I don't need any more.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, you don't have to get it as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: That was just the initial writing from the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can have the pharmacy pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that being said, you just lock your current price in,\n\nSpeaker 1: or current market price basically, for the same quantity or less or more.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you don't receive any refill, or you don't get billed\n\nSpeaker 1: because you don't need it at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the doctor consultation is preserved.\n\nSpeaker 1: They pause you, I think, up to half a year,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can get it once or twice a year maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so keep the prescription you said,\n\nSpeaker 1: just call and get it filled every once in a while?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes. So I pause it for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you're not required to get it as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not even required to get 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get more, you can get less, you can get 10 pills once or twice a year\n\nSpeaker 2: to keep your account active and keep the same price.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you don't have to get it as often.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to have them pause you for half a year,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you can call and reorder, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, that'll work out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then let's say when you're active in the future,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can let us know and be like,\n\nSpeaker 2: I need you to send me my pill maybe every 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cool, yeah, that works. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, all right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, you all set up, pause your prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can call us to reorder or get your refill once or twice a year\n\nSpeaker 1: to keep the price.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, sounds like a plan.
