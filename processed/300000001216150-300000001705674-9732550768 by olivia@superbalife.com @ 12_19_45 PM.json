    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Olivia. Bob Ursioli. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Good, Robert. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I keep getting more and more of these pills. I'd like to cancel, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay, Robert, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 8-25-45.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And you're located at 16 Algonquian, Paris, Wharton, New Jersey, 07885. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct. That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Yeah, so I do see your prescription here, Robert. Yeah, and just so you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do always have the option with your prescription that if you don't want to receive those regular refills,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time\n\nSpeaker 2: just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that would work is if you did want to place it on hold, you would at least still be able to order the product\n\nSpeaker 2: within the next six months. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's just not working for me, so I'd like to totally cancel, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. That's a different conversation. That does make sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, it is. The last part of my job is to let you know that if the pills aren't working for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: you do qualify for a free sample of our newest, highest quality product because it looks like you haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is their fastest-acting, longest-lasting stuff we've ever made, and it comes from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it is FDA-approved, third-party tested. But my favorite thing about it is that we've specifically formulated it\n\nSpeaker 1: to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation and headache. And if you did want to try it,\n\nSpeaker 2: the way it would work is I'd send you 10 free pills. You'd probably get them by next Tuesday or Wednesday,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then you'd have until June to try them out, make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 2: So kind of like a five- to six-month free trial loosely because it would be a new prescription that started\n\nSpeaker 1: with the free sample, and then it's placed on hold for you while you try it out until June.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because what we believe would happen is that over the next two to five months, you'd run out,\n\nSpeaker 1: you'd really like them, you'd give us a call, you'd want to order some, and then we might be able to keep you.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if not, you just have 10 free pills, and you'd have until June to let us know where you're at with them.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is a great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll try it. I mean, nothing seems to work. But anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I want to cancel the original prescription, and I will try the new one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, of course. Yeah. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I'm going to send these out to you at 100 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ship it to 16 Algonquin Terrace, Wharton, New Jersey, 07885?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. So yeah, you should receive these by next week.\n\nSpeaker 2: I hope you love them, and I think you will.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you need anything before June, just give us a call at this number, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, and the last thing is, Robert, if you want to get the most you can out of the pills,\n\nSpeaker 1: you just want to make sure that you take them on an empty stomach\n\nSpeaker 2: and that you avoid alcohol and caffeine the day that you take them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Robert. Well, thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too, now. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
