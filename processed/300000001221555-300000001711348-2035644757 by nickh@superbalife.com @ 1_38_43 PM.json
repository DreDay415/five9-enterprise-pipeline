I didn't realize I still had a whole bottle sitting at my desk. So is there a way you can help me get this canceled?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, sure. Let me pull it up here. Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: John Chipman.\n\nSpeaker 1: C-H-I-P as in Paul.\n\nSpeaker 2: M-A-N. John Chipman.\n\nSpeaker 1: And M-1-64.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you want me to cancel this order that was just placed today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. Let me just double check here. It hasn't been assigned tracking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to go ahead and put a cancel request at the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once they confirm that that order was canceled, I'll be able to issue that refund, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it does happen to go through, you'll just need to return it for a refund, but I think—\n\nSpeaker 1: We snagged it in time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think so.\n\nSpeaker 1: I literally ordered it two minutes ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate you asking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there anything else I can do for you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
