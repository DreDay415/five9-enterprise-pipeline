    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, how are you today?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm well, thanks for asking. How can I help you out today? What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's the Viagra, what's it called, Viagra A?\n\nSpeaker 1: The Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it B something?\n\nSpeaker 1: The new Viagra AGV, that's what we call it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've tried, I've dealt with a problem for many years.\n\nSpeaker 2: As far as, I've taken Viagra, I've taken Cialis,\n\nSpeaker 1: I also took, I took the, at one time, the testosterone shots,\n\nSpeaker 2: and something really, it never really worked, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I got the shot one time, it didn't get fully erected, but it did somewhat.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I would have to get my shot in my penis before, you know, actually having sex,\n\nSpeaker 1: and it would take a little while.\n\nSpeaker 2: But how good, if I've taken all these other ones, and I haven't really been successful,\n\nSpeaker 1: is this one going to be, like, better and more successful?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's just hard to say.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you got the injection already, I mean, chances are,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're not going to see a lot of success from anything else,\n\nSpeaker 1: especially if that didn't even work.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's usually, like, the last step for a lot of guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: We definitely could try it out if you wanted to, of course, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for that, that's a lot of, usually that's, like, the last step.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's, like, the strongest thing offered on the market, pretty much.\n\nSpeaker 2: But completely up to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted to try it out, definitely can give it a shot.\n\nSpeaker 2: We are the number one Viagra on the market right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: We definitely are the best seller, and we have the best results.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you don't need a prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because usually I went to the urologist and always got a prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: We'll set you up with a doctor here, and then he'll write you the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then we'll mail it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you will get a prescription written.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if I get the prescription mailed, do I have to go to a drugstore?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or is it shipped?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we'll mail it to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't, you know, I've tried weight loss drugs and all this other stuff\n\nSpeaker 1: and haven't had much results.\n\nSpeaker 2: But how expensive is it to purchase?\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you allowed to visit?\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, they say it's cheaper to buy more bottles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just to try it out, is it expensive to buy just one bottle?\n\nSpeaker 2: So you buy pills, not a bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's 40 pills for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's, like, the most that we sell at one time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said I would have to talk to a doctor?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so you may have to talk to a doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would give you a medical survey,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then the doctor will look at your medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then based upon the answers you give there,\n\nSpeaker 1: they will approve or deny the medicine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually they approve it unless you're, like, really sick or anything like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we mail it out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I have, like, I can AFib and stuff like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's never affected my heart when I tried the other stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should be fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: We deal with a ton of older guys who have a ton of different things.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unless you're really, really dealing with something serious,\n\nSpeaker 1: you should be okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been seeing this one advertisement on Facebook about\n\nSpeaker 2: there's one that has baking soda and something else\n\nSpeaker 1: and something else in it and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it's supposed to resize your penis,\n\nSpeaker 1: because I do have a small penis.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this says it does help it grow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: So this will help you be as large as you're possibly able to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do you have to pay for shipping in that?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, there's no shipping added, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how much did you say it was, $100?\n\nSpeaker 2: $149.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how many pills?\n\nSpeaker 2: For 40 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So how often can you take this pill?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you can take a pill per day.\n\nSpeaker 2: They don't want you seeing 100 milligrams in 24 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: You take it when you need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I took it, like, once or twice a week, it'd be fine?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do I have to do now to get in contact with you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can help you to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would get your information.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would give you this medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you would place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: The doctor will then look at that chart.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want to speak to the doctor, you'll have the opportunity.\n\nSpeaker 1: If he wants to speak to you, you also.\n\nSpeaker 2: He'll reach out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: He or she.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do they buy the pill before all this happens,\n\nSpeaker 1: or do they take it and then decide and call you,\n\nSpeaker 2: or then you go ahead and you order it?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you purchase before the doctor even knows what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then if they deny you, then you'll just get the order canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: They'll refund your money back to whatever card it came from.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just, you know, being over the phone and the Internet and stuff like that,\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think there's a harm in trying it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you want, I can help you place an order over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's no problem if you're ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I have to pay for it first.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go get my wallet, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I still have to give you this medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 2: So whenever you're ready, let me know, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hang on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, when I took the regular Viagra, and like I said,\n\nSpeaker 2: then I tried the Cialis, and, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: but like I said, at least I tried the shot,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it did work somewhat.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's usually the most effective.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, so if you want to get started, I'll get started.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll get some demographic information from you to get it started.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you need my name and address and all that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll get that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll be in a few minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: The number you called from, 716-572-8356,\n\nSpeaker 2: is that the best number to reach you at?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: And did you have an email address for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: JNGrant56JNGrant56.\n\nSpeaker 1: JNGrant56, J as in Jeffrey, N as in Nancy, Grant, G-R-A-N-T.\n\nSpeaker 2:

name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Grant, G-R-A-N-T.\n\nSpeaker 1: Zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 14225.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, 14225.\n\nSpeaker 2: What's that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Your date of birth.\n\nSpeaker 2: September 15, 1956.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the gender is a biological male.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Jeffrey Grant, 09-15-56, 14225 is the zip.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I'll give you that medical survey.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a series of 14 questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: There are multiple choices.\n\nSpeaker 2: You'll have the answers.\n\nSpeaker 1: So one of these answer choices will apply to you for each question.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll go ahead and begin now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll read the questions and then the answer choices.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me know which applies to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: How long have you been concerned about or wanted to improve the size,\n\nSpeaker 2: hardness, duration, or power of your erections,\n\nSpeaker 1: or the ability to obtain or maintain an erection?\n\nSpeaker 2: Less than three months, three to six months,\n\nSpeaker 1: seven to 12 months, one to two years, or longer?\n\nSpeaker 2: One to two years.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you ever consulted a doctor or counselor for personal sexual problems?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that a primary care doctor, urologist, counselor?\n\nSpeaker 2: I go to a urologist.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have a urologist.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said he prescribed you Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you ever tried any of the other following treatments,\n\nSpeaker 2: Cialis, Tadalafil, Vardenafil, Levita, Jaxan, Abondor?\n\nSpeaker 1: I did Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did Viagra, Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did the testosterone shots, and I had the shot in the penis.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said the Cialis and the Viagra weren't effective, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Were there any side effects from those past treatments?\n\nSpeaker 2: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: When was the last time you had a physical?\n\nSpeaker 2: Less than a year ago, less than three years ago,\n\nSpeaker 1: between three and five years ago, or longer?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I had one

take – suffer blood pressure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm heavy, so I take a\n\nSpeaker 2: pill for – because I have AFib, so it's a heart pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm a diabetic, one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, two.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries there.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I definitely will get all the medication names in just a moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the next question is, are there –\n\nSpeaker 2: have you had your blood pressure measured in the past three years?\n\nSpeaker 1: It sounds like that's a yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: To the best of your knowledge, how is your blood pressure?\n\nSpeaker 1: Normal, elevated, high, very high, or abnormally low?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's always usually –\n\nSpeaker 1: because I take all the prescriptions for medication,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's always – I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But do you have, like, a ballpark reading?\n\nSpeaker 2: Normal, elevated, high, very high, or abnormally low?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it sounds like normal when you're on the medication.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it's normal.\n\nSpeaker 1: I never – like, I take medication,\n\nSpeaker 2: so they never tell me it's too high or they –\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, the doctor would, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: you know, tell me that I have a problem and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: But there's been no problem with my blood pressure.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we'll continue from
