    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Scott Miller.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, Mr. Miller. What's your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to put a pencil or put a hold on my automatic refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. I can do that for you. What's your zip code, Mr. Miller?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1-8-0-1-3.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Awesome. Are you at 9544 Upper Little Creek in Bangor, PA? 1-8-0-1-3?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome. Okay, ooh, yeah, you're getting it monthly. Let's do this. I will switch you over to as needed so that way you can order whenever you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, and then so you won't get anything monthly. It keeps your prescription active, and you can order whenever you want to.\n\nSpeaker 2: What?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I didn't say nothing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. No, I thought I heard that anyway. It could just be the phone line. Just be aware, if you don't place any order within that six-month period,\n\nSpeaker 2: you will get one refill at the end of six months just to keep your prescription active, but otherwise you won't get anything else. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, awesome. Thank you so much. Have a great day, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You too. Thank you. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
