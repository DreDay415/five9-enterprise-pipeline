    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is John Riley. I want to cancel my stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can help you with this, Mr. Riley. May I have your date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-28-64.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And while I'm pulling up your account, may I ask the reason for wanting to cancel?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's getting too expensive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's see here. Well, I do see, Mr. Riley, that you have been one of our VIPs for some months now.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to keep access to the Viagra, you can change it to every four months, five months, even up to every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: By doing that, we can also discount it by $10, so it will be $53.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: How many pills are in that nine?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ten.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ten?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll just go ahead and cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you sure? You don't want to take the offer for $53.95, saving $10, and then all that will be?\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to get it as often as every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to pass.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no worries, Mr. Riley. I've gone ahead and canceled it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care of that. Your prescription is canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
