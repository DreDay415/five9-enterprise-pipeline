    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Scorblue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I ordered some of this product from you and it didn't work and they're sending me more.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I never signed up for more than one trial bottle of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me see your prescription and how it is written, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your full name and date of birth, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: Alan Quackenbush.\n\nSpeaker 1: 11-25-45.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the prescription number if you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please.\n\nSpeaker 2: 9-8-8-8-7-5-0.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, Alan, I see your prescription was originally written on November 20th and that was for the 100 mg Viagra. Does that sound accurate?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It looks like it was ordered online.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the reason you're getting these reoccurring is the doctor had initially written it with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're not required or obligated to do it that way. It's just how they normally do it with the lower milligram dosages.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you didn't want any future orders, you are always welcome to pause it and then you can place orders as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you mentioned that you didn't have the effects you were expecting. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct. I'm 80 years old, though, I want to tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm taking a look at your health survey really quick. See if there's any reasons that could be the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: Aloquus.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, sir, I see here you just got the generic Viagra. Did you ever have interest in trying the Viagra AGV?\n\nSpeaker 1: I never heard of it. I don't know much about this stuff. A couple of my buddies are telling me,\n\nSpeaker 2: we got this, they got different things and tried it.\n\nSpeaker 1: My girlfriend says, yeah, get it. What do you got to lose?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm on a fixed income. I'm going to be very blunt with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't keep spending money on something I don't need.\n\nSpeaker 2: I haven't got my bill yet for my credit card, so I don't even know what they charged me for the second round.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is what I was going to recommend, Alan, because the prescription that I see,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's written for you is for generic Sidenafil from Apco Pharma.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's from a lab here in the United States. There's nothing technically wrong with it,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it is not considered as potent or effective as the one from Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you wanted, I could absolutely send you 10 free to try of the Viagra AGV and see if you had any different results.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then I could put your account on a pause.\n\nSpeaker 1: You wouldn't receive any future orders or charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: It would give you enough time to try the medication and then get back to us and see how the AGV works.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, tell me the letters you're saying again.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry?\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, Viagra AGV is the newest formula from the Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here at Score Blue, we sell generic Viagra, we sell the original name brand Viagra, the blue pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is about $99 a pill because of its effectiveness, and we sell the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGV is authorized Viagra from France.\n\nSpeaker 2: A is in Apco, C is in George, V is in Victor?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: AGV, okay. And now what's that cost?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I could honor the prices that you've had right now with your previous prescriptions\n\nSpeaker 2: if you wanted to go that route later down the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I'm telling you is because you didn't get the results that you intended with the generic,\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd be happy to send you a replacement 10 pills for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Alright, now what have you charged me so far since I don't have my bill yet from my MasterCard?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so you have three transactions of $63.\n\nSpeaker 2: Really?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir. $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's total?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's $63.95 per prescription refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's not what they told me when I got that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're telling me I'm going to owe three times $64?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, sir, you've already paid these.\n\nSpeaker 2: You've had three orders so far.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I never authorized three. I authorized one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. That's why I'm reiterating this was written with refills, but you've been receiving these since November.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm telling you, I got one refill. That's it. It just came the other day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So, I look at the tracking. It shows all three have been delivered to your address.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, like I said, this is how the doctor wrote the initial prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is perfectly adjustable, but what I can do for you is pause this altogether.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will not receive anything else. You will not be charged anything else.\n\nSpeaker 2: I then send you AGV to try to see if you like that better.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can get back to me and let me know if you had better results.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, again, we're talking $190.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct. And this is how the – this is – I'm – again, this is what was ordered online.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure what – I mean, what – Alan, this is a prescription that comes with refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's noted in the notes of the prescription when you place it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's with the large paperwork explaining it from GoGoMeds.\n\nSpeaker 1: This comes with refills that you can adjust to your needs and schedule.\n\nSpeaker 2: Boy, are you guys shysters. I got two bottles.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Alan, you want to return them? You can return them. We're not shysters.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want it, you can return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I return something I never got? I've got two bottles. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried the first one, and it didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have – you want to return it. If you have it, you can just put return to sender on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I'm looking at your tracking, and you received three.\n\nSpeaker 1: Three of our deliveries were delivered to 3670 Buffalo Creek Road.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, my resolution with this is if you want, you can simply return that most recent one back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once that's filed, I can issue a refund of $63.95, and then I send you the replacement AGV for you to try.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Now, how do I return this? What do I have to do?\n\nSpeaker 1: You just write return to sender on the white package that you received on the 24th.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to know what happened to the other one for $64.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would, too, but it shows here that it was delivered to your address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, boy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm looking at my tracking from the United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we know what they are.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got a couple friends that's younger – way younger than me that work for the Postal Service, and it's a joke.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you know, if Donald Trump wants to do something good, he ought to take care of the Postal Service because it's a mess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, my one friend, he went into work yesterday, and they sat around.\n\nSpeaker 2: About 40% of the people showed up, the mail deliverers, and they sat around for four hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: They never got the mail for the day from the central distribution place in Pittsburgh.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, the guy told them, well, you can go home.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, what about the four hours we were here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we can't pay you for those.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, he went home.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, he risked his life getting in there yesterday because the snow is 15, 18 inches deep here.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they sent him home.\n\nSpeaker 2: He doesn't get paid.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, they want to know if he's coming in today.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, I will send this back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll tape it up as the bag is ripped.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I just wonder what happened to the second one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Somebody, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's hard for me to say.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm looking at the tracking here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does show it was delivered there in late December.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, anything could happen around Christmas time, that's for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not a person that doesn't tell the truth.\n\nSpeaker 2: I didn't get it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I trust you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's why I'm offering here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You return that back.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you a replacement AGV, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can try that one.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I think you'll get better results.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that is the strongest one on the market right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Please, I don't want any further deliveries until I tell you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how much is this AGV that you're telling me about if, in the future,\n\nSpeaker 1: I would want to buy it?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm willing to honor your original pricing of what you ordered.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, that would be $63.95 for 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, next question.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your extension?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because they ask you that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who do I want to talk to?\n\nSpeaker 2: At least I can talk to the same person.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0042.\n\nSpeaker 1: 0042.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what was your first name again?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nick, that's my grandson's name.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I will send this back.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have my word that it's going out.\n\nSpeaker 1: As soon as I can get out of my driveway.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm too old to be shoveling snow on a 500-foot driveway.\n\nSpeaker 1: It might be a week or so until I'd be able to get this to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to put it here and tape it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, when you send me these, they're going to come how many?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to send you 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll just make sure that we were on the same page with everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've lost more stuff with the mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: See, I live out in the country, just to give you a little background.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're not really hired by the U.S. Postal Service direct.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're subcontractors.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they come in a Jeep or whatever kind of car with trains all over the place.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I can't tell you, Nick, how many times I've got other people's mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, I'm the kind of person, if I get your mail, if I can't take it to you or put it in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, again, I live in the country.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can only see three houses from my house other than mine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who knows?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sure people, they get something if they open it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I ordered a very expensive painting from the Grand Canyon when I was out there.\n\nSpeaker 2: It came, not UPS, but United Postal Service, not the Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it didn't come here.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the guy, the artist that I bought it from, sent me all the paperwork.\n\nSpeaker 1: It wasn't even close to my signature, nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you know, that's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: They wonder why this stuff happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I agree. I agree.\n\nSpeaker 1: That should be how it happens.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, they can't make money.\n\nSpeaker 1: They can't make money.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I'm old enough to remember three cents for a first-class letter and a penny for a postcard.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't even know what it costs now.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just buy the stamps.\n\nSpeaker 1: They're forever.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, they have an F on them or forever.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it doesn't matter what they cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I think they're up close to 80 cents now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I sent a package the other day, just cross-country to my parents.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that cost me $25, not including the boxes and everything that I paid for.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's sad. It just is.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, but it's the old story.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, things are so out of whack now.\n\nSpeaker 1: I live in Pennsylvania.\n\nSpeaker 2: And our minimum wage is still $7.25 or $7.50.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, who the hell is going to work for that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, how do you – you know, and then you get – are you in California?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, my daughter lives in Long Beach.\n\nSpeaker 1: And she tells me what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: She's thinking about – she's a teacher.\n\nSpeaker 1: She's going to wait tables probably in the summer months,\n\nSpeaker 2: throwing a little extra money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here, you get $2.02 an hour plus tips.\n\nSpeaker 2: Out there, it's $17 an hour.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's true.\n\nSpeaker 1: What a disparity.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, she just – she had to get a new car.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is my last story for you, Nick.\n\nSpeaker 2: She just bought a new car.\n\nSpeaker 1: And when you trade your car in out here, if you bought a $40,000 car\n\nSpeaker 2: and they gave you $20,000 for your trade-in,\n\nSpeaker 1: you pay tax on the difference between the 20 and the 40, okay, at 6%.\n\nSpeaker 2: You had to pay almost 11% on the whole price of the new car, the whole $40,000.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, how much money do they need?\n\nSpeaker 2: I told her, I said, you'll never be able to live out there once you're retired.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the cost of everything is just crazy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know how you do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I really don't.\n\nSpeaker 2: I really don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, listen, Nick, it was a pleasure talking to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will take this all up and write return to sender on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: and hopefully it gets back to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: We should expect to hear – I mean, like I said, as soon as you send it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: given the weather circumstances, two to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't understand that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So once you put it in the mail from Pennsylvania,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can probably expect that within two to five business days on the return.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm going to take it directly to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I will do that, my friend.\n\nSpeaker 2: I thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: My understanding was that they were going to send me like eight pills for –\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought it was like $7.95 shipping included.\n\nSpeaker 2: Interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: I always recommend calling anyways for this,\n\nSpeaker 2: because I don't like our website in general.\n\nSpeaker 1: So any adjustments or orders, feel free to just call us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, buddy.\n\nSpeaker 1: In the future, I sure will.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I have your extension.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a wonderful day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
