    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey, thanks for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I got... I had a prescription sent to me and...\n\nSpeaker 1: Which, you know, was a little strange because I didn't put an auto refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: But anyways, it was basically just an empty bag.\n\nSpeaker 1: There was a hole in the bag and the prescription was not there.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was your first and last name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Don Fuller, F-U-L-L-E-R.\n\nSpeaker 2: And did you get any sort of, like, notification from USPS or anything like that, Mr. Fuller?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Nope.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay, no worries.\n\nSpeaker 1: Usually, we'd have you, like, file a claim, you know, and depending on the terms of the investigation,\n\nSpeaker 2: we'd either reship or take whatever appropriate action.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is only your second order. You said you weren't expecting it either way.\n\nSpeaker 2: I definitely will go ahead and replace this for you at no cost.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's been noted down here on your profile, so if anything goes missing in the future,\n\nSpeaker 2: we just make sure we take appropriate steps in order to locate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: As a one-time courtesy, no problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to reship. It should have been 10 pills for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'll see that come out before the end of this week, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So then, is there a reason why it's auto fill?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it looks like you set up on our VIP prescription to receive refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can pause that service for you as well if you did want to, like, receive pills in the future\n\nSpeaker 1: or, like, place orders or just keep the prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can do that manually online or over the phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I've looked online.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I say, I didn't expect it to be an auto, you know, refill kind of thing\n\nSpeaker 1: because I was just trying it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so what I was going to do when I refilled it would go to the $100,000 or whatever,\n\nSpeaker 1: instead of the $50,000.\n\nSpeaker 2: But like I say, then they just sort of, you know, showed up.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I was like, well, you know, without anything in it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, I was like, well, I opened it, you know, because the side is open.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm like, why is there stuff for this, you know, this blue, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I was like, so then I looked at my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it was like, oh, they shipped something a month later.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it was like, well, I didn't expect it to auto because, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: I was basically trying it out, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'd like to change it to the 100 milligrams instead of 50\n\nSpeaker 1: and the same amount of pills, but probably do like every three months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or I don't know if I could just go in there and, you know, change the...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can push it for you 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what you can do is you can always call anytime in between then\n\nSpeaker 1: if you ever need it sooner or if you ever need a little more time, just give us a shout.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, is there a way to get it to 100 instead of the 50?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'll take care of that for you as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: No issue at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: When I send this replacement order, it'll be as the 100 milligram option, not the 50.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And still the same amount of pills, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And like I say, I definitely will, you know, try to deal with the post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know how that goes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely, I do.\n\nSpeaker 2: No issue there.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you out this replacement, Mr. Fuller,\n\nSpeaker 2: so look out for that in the next few days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then 30 days from basically now or whatever will be the next shipment?\n\nSpeaker 2: 90 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: 90, that's what I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep, 90 days after this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye.",
