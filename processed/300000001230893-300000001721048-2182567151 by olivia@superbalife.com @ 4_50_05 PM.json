    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Kevin Brink and I called ScoreBlue.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi Kevin. Yeah, that's exactly correct. Yes. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can help you with this. Okay, Kevin, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: August 2, 1973.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and you're located at 1117 McGuire Drive, Grand Rapids, Minnesota, 55744?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great. Yeah, so I do see your prescription here. Okay, well, yeah, so you've been with us a long time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, two things. First, just so you know, if you don't want to receive monthly regular refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: you certainly don't have to, you always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that would work is you could still place an order before then,\n\nSpeaker 1: you just have to give us a call to place it yourself whenever you are ready.\n\nSpeaker 2: The prescription no longer works, so I would like to cancel the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. So the second part of what it is my job to share with you is you've only ever taken the generic with us\n\nSpeaker 2: and the price is kind of steep right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: For people who have only ever taken the generic, if the script is no longer working for them,\n\nSpeaker 2: we are offering you guys a free sample of ten pills of our newest highest quality Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's called our Viagra AGB, and it looks like you haven't tried it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like I mentioned, it's our fastest acting, longest lasting stuff we've ever made\n\nSpeaker 1: and our newest pill from our Pfizer labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 2: But my favorite thing about it is we've specifically formulated them to cut out the side effects of sinus agitation\n\nSpeaker 1: and headache, and the way it would work is the free sample is ten pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I would send those out to you at $0.00, and they'd get to Minnesota probably by next Monday or Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: You would have until July. So I'd place that prescription on hold for you until July for you to try them out,\n\nSpeaker 2: make sure you love them, make sure you prefer them to your old script.\n\nSpeaker 1: We believe you would, and also if you did, we could offer you a much better deal\n\nSpeaker 2: than what you were getting with your previous prescription anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: But let's say, you know, you love them, great, everything works out, you're going to run out\n\nSpeaker 2: and you're going to call us by July to order some and to set up the script the way you want it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now if they didn't work for you, that's fine. Just give us a call by July to let us know where you're at with them,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we can help you cancel the script, do whatever you need to do, figure that out.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I don't think that's what would happen because the product is a really great product.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you do want to try it...\n\nSpeaker 1: You understand that the product doesn't work anymore for me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the regular...\n\nSpeaker 1: It's still Syldentafil. Right, but it's still Syldentafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the active ingredient in all Viagra products ever made is Syldentafil,\n\nSpeaker 1: including the branded Viagra, the HEV, the regular Syldentafil.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, that ingredient, yes, is still active.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're saying all products that include Syldentafil do not work for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I am understanding that it's not the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: The problem is arousal.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Syldentafil doesn't do anything on arousal.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just tries to lower my blood pressure so that my unit works and stands up.\n\nSpeaker 2: It has nothing to do with arousal.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have just started a prescription for Lugiette Ready,\n\nSpeaker 2: which does have control with some other medications on arousal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you always know where to find us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, if you want to put it on hold\n\nSpeaker 2: and then send me this other medication that might work wonders,\n\nSpeaker 1: is the difference to the Syldentafil that I already try,\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand that what you're trying to say is nasal inflammation\n\nSpeaker 1: or congestion and headache.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's medications in there to reduce those,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you've always had those in other brand-name Viagra\n\nSpeaker 2: and the generics just didn't have those medications in it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the AGV, it's the way you want to think of the formula, Kevin,\n\nSpeaker 1: is it's Pfizer's French direct generic of the blue pill of the original branded Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: which we do also sell, but we sell it, and so does Pfizer, for $99 per pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the AGV, it's like almost a carbon copy formula,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it is the newest on the market.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yes, you're exactly correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: It includes those ingredients just like the branded Viagra to ward off the side effects.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's the best stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, yeah, if you want to try it, I'm happy to send you some\n\nSpeaker 1: and to place the script on hold for you until July\n\nSpeaker 2: while you compare and contrast it with whatever else you're doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: So can I ship this to 1117 McGuire Drive, Grand Rapids, Minnesota, 55744?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great, and I'm going to send it to you at 100 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 2: because that's what you're already approved for.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just remember, I mean, you seem pretty educated on this stuff,\n\nSpeaker 2: but just remember to take these on an empty stomach.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really important.\n\nSpeaker 2: And to avoid alcohol the day you take them and caffeine,\n\nSpeaker 1: but alcohol is more important just because alcohol restricts blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 2: They both do, but more so alcohol.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, yeah, you should notice the difference, and I hope you do.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we're always here Monday through Friday at this phone number\n\nSpeaker 1: for any specific needs that you may have.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, yeah, I hope you enjoy these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, bye.",
