Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's been a problem here lately. It got rerouted and it's been a mess, and I don't know where it's at now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's moving throughout Florida now. Where are you at?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm in Daytona. Ormond Beach, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'd imagine maybe by tomorrow or Saturday. It's in Florida now, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I looked at my email and it shows the tracker said it's in Orlando.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I see that. So maybe by Friday or Saturday. If not, give us a call and we'll have it replaced for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what she said. I appreciate that. She told me to call her if I needed to. That's why I got the suspension. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let's give it a couple more days. I don't know what's going on, but let's give it a couple more days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ask you a question?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, you're a representative. You know about this product here, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, my uncles use it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is it really better than regular Viagra?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what they tell me. They're down in Mexico constantly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Say that again?\n\nSpeaker 1: They're down in Mexico constantly having fun with it. So, yeah, I'd say they work very, very well.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean, they?\n\nSpeaker 1: My uncles.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your uncles?\n\nSpeaker 1: My uncles, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't think I'd have to go to Mexico to get that product.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was just giving an example. I was just giving an example.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's really Viagra, but like a Viagra on steroids? Or it works a different way?\n\nSpeaker 1: On steroids, it's a different formula that Pfizer invented. It's a lot more potent, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're definitely going to love it.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what she says, too. And this is all FDA approved, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: 100%.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I appreciate it. I really do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 100%. Alrighty, William. Hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
