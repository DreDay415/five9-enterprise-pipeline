The label itself should indicate like A-G-V in parentheses.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you see that anywhere on there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, there was nothing that said A-G-V.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was all Sildenafil, and that was the only marking it had on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, let me just double check something.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, let's see, and you placed, oh, you placed this order online, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Yeah, if I look at my account, it says A-G-V on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the label on the prescription bottle didn't have A-G-V on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me just double check and see what you may have received.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. It looks like you got the American one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll take care of this for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you said you got the American one, I thought that\n\nSpeaker 2: the store rule was all American manufactured.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, the A-G-V is from France.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's direct from the Pfizer facility.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, no, that's the one that's in high demand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, not that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, that's still good, but, you know, definitely you want to get,\n\nSpeaker 2: so these are in high demand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to have to break, I'm going to have to ship this to you in two batches of 25.\n\nSpeaker 2: The reason is, again, these are in super high demand,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we want to make sure you get the pills first,\n\nSpeaker 2: because sometimes these get stolen, and that would really suck.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, let's see here.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're at 8305 Hawk Nest Drive in Richmond, Virginia, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I'm going to go ahead and send the first 25 out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you receive it, please let us know, just so we know that it arrived safely,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we'll send out the next 25, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, how did I get just the generic, you know, my online count shows I picked A-G-V?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's really weird, because it's on this end,\n\nSpeaker 2: it shows that you may have selected the generic,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I'm not sure, I'm going to have to check it with the pharmacy,\n\nSpeaker 2: but we will send you the French ones, because the French one is the big deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the one that's, you know, that's the A-G-V that we want.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I thought I was, so I was confused a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, very good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Modzelewski, I will get that out to you now, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: When do I expect to receive that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Give it about two, three days, business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: This shipment came super quick, so I was like, wow.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, yeah, I wasn't sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, we'll get that out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.",
