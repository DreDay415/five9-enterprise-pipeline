    "text": "Speaker 1: Yes, I am calling to please ask you guys to refund all my money you guys have been taking.\n\nSpeaker 2: In my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm kind of baffled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I checked my account yesterday, I think two days ago, on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that you guys have been charging my account.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not a subscriber to you guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: I bought one time, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You guys have been taking money in my account, I don't even know how to explain it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't really usually check my account like that until Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: I sat, I said let me review my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see that you guys have been taking I think $113, $113.\n\nSpeaker 2: Come on man, that's not right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's because you have my bank account information or card information does not authorize you\n\nSpeaker 2: guys to be taking money from my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: I only bought from you guys once.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I need, I'll buy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not going to be having a bunch of medicine sitting in my house.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I need, I'll buy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: I definitely understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me pull up your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name and birthday?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Alpha Barry and my date of birth is 12-03-1979.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I just paused your account so whenever you want to place an order, you can just call\n\nSpeaker 2: in to place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can do it online with the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're going to refund me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me see if this shipped out, hold on.\n\nSpeaker 2: That one shipped out already.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't want it, just send it back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you guys going to send my money?\n\nSpeaker 1: You said, are we going to send your money?\n\nSpeaker 2: If you're going to refund me because you took $113 from my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that was on three days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: The medicine is already on the way to you so if you don't want it, just send it back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I send it back, what's going to happen?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely you'll get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and you guys, how many times you guys took $113 from my account?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just two times.\n\nSpeaker 2: This one and the first time.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is bad, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why do you guys do that when I'm not even a subscriber?\n\nSpeaker 2: You didn't uncheck the box when you placed the original order but now you're paused out\n\nSpeaker 1: so you won't get monthly subscriptions.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not happy about this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want my money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but that's not going to solve the financial problem on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's going to solve it is the account is paused, you won't get any more subscription\n\nSpeaker 2: monthly and then you just send back the package.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have to return the product if you want your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: What if I don't receive the product?\n\nSpeaker 1: You will receive it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You live on Prospect Avenue, Prospect Street, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's where I live.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, so why wouldn't you get it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I never called for it and this fucked me financially.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because somebody does not uncheck the box, that's like a trap.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, that's like a trap.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want to be ordering stuff if I need it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's like a trap.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, you just took care of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, but I took care of that and did not get my money back and I have to go through this.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're going to get your money back, you have to return the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't keep the product and get the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not how it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did not call for the product.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have any guarantee that I'm going to receive this product?\n\nSpeaker 2: I did not call for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm like, what's going on here?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have been calling all kinds of pharmacies until one pharmacy that I called\n\nSpeaker 1: that asked me to give them, I don't know, an order number and I don't have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then they said, check their phone.\n\nSpeaker 1: I go check, I see this guy's call blue and they're the ones that gave me your guy's number.\n\nSpeaker 2: They said, no, not them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm like, what is this?\n\nSpeaker 2: When you try to ask the bank for them to dispute the charges,\n\nSpeaker 1: they're going to ask you if you are the one that authorized the payment\n\nSpeaker 2: or there's something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I don't want my card to be changing my account number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because immediately you say you don't authorize it,\n\nSpeaker 1: they're going to change your account number.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll consider it as fraud.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why I reach out to you guys to get my money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Otherwise, I think the only option I have is to call my bank and say it's a fraud.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't mind they will change the account number.\n\nSpeaker 2: I need my two money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you guys know.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way that it works when you call the bank\n\nSpeaker 1: and you let them know it's fraud,\n\nSpeaker 2: they call us and then they ask us if we have the IP number,\n\nSpeaker 1: the recording of the account being,\n\nSpeaker 2: the order being originally purchased,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then to show us where the box is.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it's a recording when you place the order.\n\nSpeaker 1: They also ask if you received the product,\n\nSpeaker 2: if we sent it out to you already,\n\nSpeaker 1: and if we received the product back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the banks understand that you have to send the product back to get the money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not saying you won't get your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't want it, you have to send the product back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I didn't receive the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. It's on the way to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was sent out three days ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because I live there,\n\nSpeaker 1: doesn't mean that I received it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did not.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not. That's why I'm like,\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not there yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's on the way to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You said you guys took from my account twice.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay? Unknown to me.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think if a customer,\n\nSpeaker 2: according to you guys,\n\nSpeaker 1: if a customer does something online,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they did not uncheck or check whatever you were trying to say,\n\nSpeaker 1: is that not your responsibility to reach out to the customer to say,\n\nSpeaker 2: hey, we see that you've placed this order,\n\nSpeaker 1: and we just wanted to make sure\n\nSpeaker 2: that you did not sign up for subscription or something like that?\n\nSpeaker 1: But you guys are...\n\nSpeaker 2: But being that the box is there,\n\nSpeaker 1: doesn't mean that everybody is super genius on this computer thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just because the box is there,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's just because you have advantage of the person's money.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have the card.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why.\n\nSpeaker 2: All you care about is the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: This medicine, as you guys said,\n\nSpeaker 2: does not even work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does not even work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So we will refund you the money.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't have a problem with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You need to send the product back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not get the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Prove me that I got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, you said you guys are picking twice.\n\nSpeaker 2: You said you guys are...\n\nSpeaker 1: You just admitted that you guys are picking...\n\nSpeaker 2: The original order that you placed in January,\n\nSpeaker 1: the very first order that you did on your own,\n\nSpeaker 2: is the first time we charged the 113.\n\nSpeaker 1: This second time is the...\n\nSpeaker 2: This time that it's on the way to you is the second time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not true.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have to return the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is there anything else I can assist you with, Mr. Barry?\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to speak to your supervisor\n\nSpeaker 2: because this is stealing.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how it goes, guys.\n\nSpeaker 2: I will have the supervisor give you a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have a lot of calls in queue.\n\nSpeaker 2: The supervisor will give you a call back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't mind waiting.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you can let the supervisor know\n\nSpeaker 1: that somebody wants it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Either way.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right. No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
