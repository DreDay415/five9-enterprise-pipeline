    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, ma'am. My name is Guy Bates. I just beep along, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to cancel my score prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can help you, Guy. Can you just confirm the date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need all that. I haven't used the others.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem. I can help you out, Guy. Can you just confirm the date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you. 7-9-43.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see you're a VIP status member.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see the doctor has you on refills on a monthly basis, which are not required.\n\nSpeaker 2: I went ahead and canceled out that refill,\n\nSpeaker 1: so you'll be paying $63.95 back on your credit card in about five business days or less.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh, is that – this is this simple?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you. Is that all?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I just want to know how the medication is working out for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you didn't call to get it. I mean, I like the product, but I'm not using it every day, you know?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, Guy, with your VIP status, you have the option.\n\nSpeaker 1: What a lot of people like to do, they just like to go ahead and pause the refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way it keeps your prescription active and keeps you locked in at your price\n\nSpeaker 1: and just allows you to call in whenever you need a refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I'm going to pause that for you until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 1: And if you don't need a refill by then, you can call us and pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you just keep your rate locked in because if prices go up, you stay the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Want to do that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you put that charge back on my credit card?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. That's going to go back on your credit card in about five business days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I went ahead and paused you until July 31st.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't need a refill by then, you just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mark your calendar and give us a call and we can pause it further.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow. What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: My extension is 0020 as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michelle, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Mother.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
