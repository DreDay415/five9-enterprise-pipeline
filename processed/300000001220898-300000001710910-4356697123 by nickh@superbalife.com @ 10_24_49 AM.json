    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Score Blue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: My name is Ronald Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I bought, I guess, the smallest amount of the Score Blue prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I then yesterday got another one in the mail, and I didn't realize that this was a recurring prescription. I want to see what I can do to...\n\nSpeaker 1: Stop that for now because I can't use all this. I won't use all this and...\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir, yeah, we can...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we can adjust this for you as needed, and I can look and see how the doctor has organized your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could I just get you the script number, please? All right, number...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it's 9933.\n\nSpeaker 2: 898, I think that's what I read.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Ronald Johnson, and could you confirm your date of birth for me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Eight...\n\nSpeaker 1: 31...\n\nSpeaker 2: 47.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm looking at the initial prescription from December, and that was for the quantity of...\n\nSpeaker 1: 20 with the pill upgrade of the 50 milligram Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then a month later moved to a quantity of 10 for your refill of the 50 milligram Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so it looks here the doctor wrote it with refills with the lower milligram dosage, expecting a patient to take two pills each sitting.\n\nSpeaker 2: That being said...\n\nSpeaker 1: This is not a subscription, Ronald. You're not required or obligated to get this monthly. It is perfectly adjustable to your needs.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you would like to call in and place orders as needed...\n\nSpeaker 1: I could simply put this on an extended pause, and that would keep...\n\nSpeaker 2: Your prescription active and give you access to the remaining refills later down the road.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, can you do that for me because...\n\nSpeaker 2: There's no reason for me to have this because I've only used the other bottle once and...\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, let me go ahead and put that on a pause for you. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: So in the future, if you want to refill, just give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now if I want the refill to be the larger dose...\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 milligrams. Yeah. Yeah, I can adjust that for you. Yeah, you just give us a call and make the adjustment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and I call this number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll put notes here on your account that you're considering moving to 100 milligrams because...\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I know your prescription's for 50, but it is perfectly safe to take two pills each sitting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I saw that on the... I saw that on the thing, so that's right. I could take two instead of just one and...\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine, why don't I just...\n\nSpeaker 2: Make your notes the way you are and I'll call when I need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I won't have to get any more, and I apologize for messing it up.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. No, you're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I went ahead and made these adjustments. You're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome, thank you. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
