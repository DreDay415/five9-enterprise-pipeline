I would like to cancel my order, subscription, or whatever you want to call it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I have Eddie Ray, St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me see here. It does look like you are a VIP member here, Eddie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Were you still just working on that first order? Don't need anything just yet?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't need anything. I don't want to order anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, were you not a fan of the pills? Did they not give you that kick you were looking for?\n\nSpeaker 1: Some, but I just don't want any more.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, alright.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're still on the hunt, Eddie, for something to give you that kick, we are with Pfizer.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I can message my pharmacy and see if we can kick it up a notch.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see you're only getting 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you want, I can send you a sample of something a little bit stronger and a little bit more potent.\n\nSpeaker 1: I won't flood it with 25 pills. I'll just send 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you like the ones that I send you better than the ones that you were getting before,\n\nSpeaker 1: just call us back and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we can accommodate however we need to with a refill schedule that best fits the bill for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right now, I've already got some on the way. Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you want, just write return to sender on it, throw it back in the mailbox,\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll issue a refund for that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll probably take those, but just don't send any more until I contact you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I'll give you six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you have plenty of time to try a couple of pills,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then that should be able to determine whether or not this is for you, which it probably will be.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know these are going to kick in the way you need it to.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just call us back and let us know what the best refill schedule should be after, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, sounds good. I appreciate it, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. I hope you have a great one. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're getting some calls.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, hey, girls, Cindy Crosby on the left, and 19-year-old Beth is celebrating on the right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good afternoon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, he's great for one of us of all time.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: The stars' 19-year-old star lived the 2010 Olympic gold medal in hockey.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you all for being here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm Joan Morton of the San Jose area.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm already retired in 2023, and the stars are my all-time leader in this.\n\nSpeaker 1: I celebrate and describe the Olympic situation as a perfect set-up for me,\n\nSpeaker 2: because especially if I work here, I'm very much going to look at the same thing\n\nSpeaker 1: and see if no one will want me.\n\nSpeaker 2: And learning from it, getting it, and finding new lessons,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's just going to be so important to me.\n\nSpeaker 2: The lady over here is Cindy Crosby.\n\nSpeaker 1: She first came to the Olympics in December.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know if any of you have seen her.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's Morton.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good job.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is so good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Great to have you all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Again congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congress, congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.\n\nSpeaker 1: How about this one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Congratulations.",
