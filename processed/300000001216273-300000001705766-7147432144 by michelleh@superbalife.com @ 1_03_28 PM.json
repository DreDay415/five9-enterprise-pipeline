    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, I had signed up for you guys to send me some Viagra, what's it called?\n\nSpeaker 1: AGV?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but I think they got my email wrong because when they texted me and they asked me to put my email in, it said it's invalid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you check my email?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, can you confirm the date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: May 26, 1951.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, your email, I have rockyperero at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's rocky, R-O-C-K-Y, perero, P-U-R-E, again, E-R-O, at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you repeat it back, love?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Rocky, R-O-C-K-Y, P-U-R-P-E-R-O, at gmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and then I'm going to go ahead and send you a password reset email so this goes to your correct email so you can log into your dashboard.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it looks like the pharmacy already, the doctor confirmed or authorized your prescription, sorry, I can't talk today.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's at the pharmacy and they'll be shipping it out to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll be shipping it out to you and once they ship it out, they'll email you a tracking number now that we have your correct email.\n\nSpeaker 1: Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: And she's saying this really does work better than the old Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the inactive ingredients in Pfizer's latest formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: It took them 10 years to perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the inactive ingredients that make it stronger and more powerful.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the easiest way is like say if you had two cups of water and you put one generic Viagra in a cup of water and you put the AGB in a cup of water.\n\nSpeaker 2: The generic is going to dissolve in 30 seconds.\n\nSpeaker 1: The AGB is going to dissolve in two to three minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that means when you swallow it, it allows the medication more time to get down to your member to work more efficiently.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, great, awesome, and it does work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it does work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Viagra worked for me for about 10 years and now it's not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, your body got used to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, so my body will start over about getting used to this new one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: People who say the generics don't work for them, the AGB works wonders for them.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're happy with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's awesome.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, you're all set.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: To you too, Julie.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bye-bye.",
