    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling. This is John. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi there. Hey, I just had a couple of questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I ordered some yesterday, but I've also seen some reviews that say that this isn't even actually real Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's real Viagra, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: We sell all FDA-approved medication, whether we sell Arcialis or Viagra, it's all FDA-approved real medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, it is. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I know you guys say a bunch of stuff about a lot of other places, and I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I haven't really seen much about you, but I'm just kind of curious about this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, I understand, and I know how the marketing is and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just to kind of make it a little simpler, a lot of other companies, what they do is they sell compounded drugs,\n\nSpeaker 2: and they have their own pharmacy making it for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're buying these from the manufacturers of the pharmaceuticals, and they're all FDA-approved.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it is a real thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Hey, okay, could you tell me this then?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it doesn't really say when I sign in.\n\nSpeaker 1: It just says something about in the pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know how long it's going to take?\n\nSpeaker 1: You said you ordered yesterday?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You usually get the pills typically five to seven days from the day you ordered it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You should have it probably next Tuesday or so, around then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because it doesn't really say anything yet.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if it says at pharmacy, that means it's processing at the pharmacy, so you've been approved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once it's done processing, they'll ship it to your home directly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually it takes a couple days once they ship it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I would expect it to be shipped out tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, does it say anything?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, it does provide a tracking number?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Once it officially ships, there will be a tracking number not only on your profile,\n\nSpeaker 2: but it will be emailed to you as well, and it's through the postal service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Postal service.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right then.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, well, okay, I just kind of, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll try it, see if it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
