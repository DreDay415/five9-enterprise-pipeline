What can I do for you tonight?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm just trying to check on the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been chatting back and forth with the doctor, and I asked him, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2: I know it takes like 24 hours to get back.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to make sure, because I ordered the AGV, and I asked him that question.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I said, hey, can you confirm that? So he just wrote, that was yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: He just wrote back. He said, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, I can confirm that. I just need your last name and zip code, Jeff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Last name's Abraham. Zip code is 16137. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: 325 La Tonka Drive?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So it did ship, and I do see you ordered the Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it was put in the mail today, actually.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, because when I got the note, it just said, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: it gave the prescription name, and it just was, like, generic,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I've taken that, and it doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So because technically the AGV is also a generic, but it's a first-party generic.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pfizer's making it instead of a third-party, like your normal generics.\n\nSpeaker 1: It legally has the same name of Sildenafil and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, in terms of the chemical composition, it is better.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And that's exactly what I wanted. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Well, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a lot easier doing this, just VFR direct and chatting back and forth.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. If you ever have any other questions, just call us.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're in the Eastern Time Zone. We're open 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. your time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Roger that. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.",
