    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir. Y'all send me 10 sample pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: A lot of ones weren't working.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're working a little bit better.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was speaking on board or something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Let me go ahead and try to pull your information up with your phone number.\n\nSpeaker 1: 352.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I have you here, Mr. Cook.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first IRS order from y'all, they worked perfectly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like two times where they didn't work, they didn't work, they didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: These work a little better, not the greatest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So you're getting the AGB 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So you want to order how many did you want to go with?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want it to be 10 again as last time or what?\n\nSpeaker 2: What kind of deals you got?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, we can start you off at 40 for $149.\n\nSpeaker 2: It will be the same price you're paying for the 40.\n\nSpeaker 1: For the tax, it will be $163.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the 25 pills for $99.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the 10 pills was for the $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I might as well get the 40, right, the cheaper?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. The more you get, the cheaper they are.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: They ain't got no kind of pills you take, like, every day,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it just works when you need it?\n\nSpeaker 1: They ain't got nothing like that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the Viagra is the best pill that's out there right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: The new one that we sent you, the AGB, I mean, like you say, it does work better.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you're getting the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's not too much that's out there better than the one that you're taking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. That's what I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: The other ones I was getting, I called and complained because they weren't even working.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: But they sent you the new and improved ones, and I'm sure, like you mentioned,\n\nSpeaker 1: those are the ones that's the best on the market right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they are working better.\n\nSpeaker 1: You are right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you want to go with 40 of those?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't want to be on a plan I call when I need something.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: The best I can do, I can push it out for, like, about five or six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because in order to get these, you do have to keep your prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 2: And that's what they did for you last time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, they kept the prescription on file.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's what they did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then if I need them before the five months, I can call you, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can call.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do it that way, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, do the five months, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That'll work.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I just took care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I went ahead and updated your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's going to be every five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can call any time before then to order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it should take about five to seven business days to get there.\n\nSpeaker 1: It should come sooner.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's the average time that it takes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, what is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a new manufacturer or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's the same manufacturer.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm from FireSafe Labs in France.\n\nSpeaker 1: But they just decided to just improve it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know how things get improved, you know, with technology.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the technology just got better.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the new and improved Viagra, it works faster.\n\nSpeaker 1: It lasts longer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And it doesn't have those same side effects that people would get,\n\nSpeaker 1: like the dizziness and headaches and the stomach aches.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, you breathe more and all that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I don't get all that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's the improvement.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so that's why they're the new and improved.\n\nSpeaker 2: Same company that made the original Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: they just improved the quality of these pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what these are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
