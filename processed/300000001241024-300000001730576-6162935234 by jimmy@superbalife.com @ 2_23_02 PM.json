I don't see any notes that it was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not saying that you didn't do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I called, and I also responded to the e-mail.\n\nSpeaker 2: I actually responded to the e-mail twice.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second time is when they responded back and said, hey, you have to call in.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm like, well, I did once, and that's why I'm calling again just to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me give you the confirmation number that you did it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you ready?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm ready.\n\nSpeaker 1: D114429C, as in Charlie, 7-8.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's showing that all auto shoots were stopped and your order was canceled.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the other one that you said, if you want a refund, just send it back to us, and we'll get you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, we're very niche and legit.\n\nSpeaker 2: You mentioned that you called your bank, so I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's going to get you the refund, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that will put you on a list where you couldn't order in the future from us because you feel like we weren't going to give you your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we definitely will give you your funds back if that's the case, if you don't want the product.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I just disputed it right away because I knew I had already called and canceled it, and I was concerned that, you know, something was going awry.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's why I called you again.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I appreciate your help in giving me the confirmation number.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a problem, sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's for the auto shipments for the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, like I said, again, the other one was sent out to you just on the 8th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.",
