    "text": "Speaker 1: Thanks for all that. Brooklyn speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm calling about a disputed charge. I've been charged for Score Blue and I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. You said you did what, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: I've been charged.\n\nSpeaker 1: For okay, more Score Blue order and you did not order it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, let's see what's going on. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your first and last name? Is it Peter Jacob Jacobi, J-A-C-O-B-I?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sorry, excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, sir, so I got you pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 2: They said—\n\nSpeaker 1: You said you didn't order this?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I ordered one time, one time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now you're being charged for a—\n\nSpeaker 2: Subsequent shipment. No, I understand, sir. I can see you didn't set it up to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you? Is that what you want to do? To order as needed going forward? You don't have to receive—\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, that's what I did initially, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So somebody's sending you stuff you're not ordering?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, sir, because if you would have set it up to order as needed—\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it's fine. We give you that option, but it would never have come out this way if it was—\n\nSpeaker 2: How it came out this way. I was very consciously ordering it one time only.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I mean, then that's fine. I mean, because we give you the opportunity to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: You just have to put as needed so we know, so you can choose again when you want your orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's not done. That's the only way it goes out this way.\n\nSpeaker 2: But so basically what we said, what we'll do is we'll keep the prescription open—\n\nSpeaker 1: For the next five months here. You're going to have to call us for your next order. We are not going to send anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: What are we going to do about the charge I just got?\n\nSpeaker 1: The order that was delivered to you, yes, which you didn't order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why did you charge me $63.75?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.75?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: That wasn't from us then because we have here it is $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to read—\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, that was a refill that went out there, sir. I do understand that you didn't order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can send it back if you'd like.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we can help you out with that refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's totally up to you, like I said.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're going to pause everything now, and you're going to have to call for your next one in the next five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know if you want to keep that. I'm not going to get any more for the next five months here or until you call.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I send it back, who do I send it back to? The address that it came from?\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is shipping manager. So are you never going to order as needed? I'm confused.\n\nSpeaker 2: I—\n\nSpeaker 1: You just received an order—\n\nSpeaker 2: For more Score Blue, but I did not intend to order, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: And if all right, so since we're being clear, since we're having an understanding—\n\nSpeaker 2: When you first purchased this, we gave you the opportunity to choose. You could pick the day, every 10th—\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanted it to come out every 10th, every two months, every 15th, every four months. You can choose.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you can put I want to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so we can do that. That's what I did first order.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, just—I just want to make sure we're clear.\n\nSpeaker 1: We give you those options when you ordered this the first time, right? You did not choose either one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right, and I know this because of how you received your orders, and you're saying you didn't order them. That's the proof, so—\n\nSpeaker 1: We did give you the opportunity to order as needed, sir. I understand. I don't know why it wasn't done. I get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why it wasn't done. That's not the point. The point is we can change it for you—\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, and we can help you out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we're not trying to scam you or anything like that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: We just want to be clear. You want to be clear, and let's be clear about this.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not want any more sent to me, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Wonderful, okay. I'm just glad that you understand what's going on now, sir. We can do that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, all right, so I'm stuck with that order now, so I'm stuck with a $62 charge.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was very clear in what I told you to do with that charge previous to what I said, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you not remember what I told you? Yeah, I think I could send it back to you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what we'll do.",
