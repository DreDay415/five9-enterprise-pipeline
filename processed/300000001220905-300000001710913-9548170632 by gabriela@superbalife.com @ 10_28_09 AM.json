    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra. How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, hello. I'm calling because I think I was put under an automatic refill and I don't want an automatic refill. I noticed the invoice in my credit card this morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, what's your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Robert Rodriguez, 122-54.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Robert. Okay, yes, so it does show here that you do have a prescription with us for Viagra AGB, a quantity of 25. So you do receive that every two months,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is why there's an order currently in Texas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I need to take that off of that because I don't need it that much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yes, so if you don't ask it that frequently, we can always go ahead and modify that monthly interval for you. We can adjust it to every four months\n\nSpeaker 1: or every five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I just do it month to month as I order it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, unfortunately, since this is a prescription, you do have to have a certain monthly interval.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you do not need it every two months, you don't have to have it every two months.\n\nSpeaker 1: But like I said, we can always adjust it to every three months or every four months\n\nSpeaker 2: or every five months. We can even do every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but I don't need the one they're sending me now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, that one already shipped out, so I'm not able to cancel it\n\nSpeaker 1: because it shipped out already. However, I can go ahead and just delay your next shipment.\n\nSpeaker 2: We can delay it until June.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, let's do six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you're on six months, and I adjusted it to every six months for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so when do you have it coming next? What date?\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not going to receive another order until the end of July.\n\nSpeaker 1: End of July. Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well, you're all set. You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have another question. I have another question as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: My question is when I ordered this, I ordered the new Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 1: and what I got was just the Lone Sun.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the Lone Sun is still the active ingredient on the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: The components are much lighter, which is why it starts working faster,\n\nSpeaker 2: stays in your system for a longer period of time,\n\nSpeaker 1: and why it does not cause any side effects.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, but I did not receive that.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not receive the Viagra AGB order.\n\nSpeaker 2: The Viagra AGB? So on the label, it's just a Greenstone LLC,\n\nSpeaker 1: and every pill should also have the number 100 engraved on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: 100 what?\n\nSpeaker 1: It should have the number 100 engraved on the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's the milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 1: but there is a difference between the regular Viagra and the new Viagra, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so the regular Classic Viagra should have an engraving that says AC 340,\n\nSpeaker 1: and the AGB should have an engraving that says 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, because what I received is not the AC.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so what I can go ahead and do for you is that I can ask the pharmacy\n\nSpeaker 2: to reship with the correct Viagra AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, because I didn't receive that this time, so that's why I ordered.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, well just to make sure that you do receive the AGB,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll ask the pharmacy to reship the order for you. Okay, Robert?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, with no extra charge, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: No extra charge, that's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Of course. Have a good rest of your day. Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, bye.",
