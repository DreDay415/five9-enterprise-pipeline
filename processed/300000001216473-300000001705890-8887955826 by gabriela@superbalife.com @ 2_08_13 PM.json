How can I assist you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I received the order today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I don't remember ordering it.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2-29-60.\n\nSpeaker 1: 1960 or 1950?\n\nSpeaker 2: 1950.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Michael Tran.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your CIP code, Michael?\n\nSpeaker 2: 92841.\n\nSpeaker 1: Michael Tran, you said?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Michael, yeah. So you placed this order on the 16th, which is the order that you received.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the 16th? How much was it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You purchased 10 pills for $49.\n\nSpeaker 2: $49? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I return this and get a refund?\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, you placed the order, so it is a really good Viagra. Have you tried it? You purchased the AGB, the best Viagra that there is.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just working within 11 minutes, stays in your system for up to 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: On the label here, it says one hour.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says that just to prepare you for when the time comes, but it starts working within 11 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is 100-milligram tablets.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I return this?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, if you're not interested in it, you can go ahead and return it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It says, right, refuse return to sender. Just be aware that you will not be able to reorder with us in the future, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So just take it to your local post office.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take to the local office?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, local post office, and ship it back to us.\n\nSpeaker 2: How long does it take for you to issue the refund?\n\nSpeaker 1: Once the pharmacy receives it, you should be able to get a refund within three to five business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: What address do I send it back?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you haven't opened it, just write refuse return to sender on it. Did you open it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so if you opened it, the return address is in the back of the bottle.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says 525 Alexander Pike, Southgate, Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: I see, okay, yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So return it back to GoGoMed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, take it to your local post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not score blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, GoGoMed, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I see, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, have a nice day.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.
