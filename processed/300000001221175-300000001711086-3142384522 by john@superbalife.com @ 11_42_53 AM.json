I've never received it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I get your zip code, Herbert?\n\nSpeaker 2: 63034.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're on Sherrywood Trail?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I am.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it was delivered on the 16th, sir, to your mailbox,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you've already disputed the charge and got your money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there's nothing really I can do, but it does say it was delivered to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Repeat that again. I've got my money back.\n\nSpeaker 2: You called your bank to dispute, so you got your money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: You got a charge back. They took the money back from us.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then your pills were delivered on January 16th to your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: As long as I've got my money back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, you stole the pills, basically.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's your one and only order with us. Have a good one.",
