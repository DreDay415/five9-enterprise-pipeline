Reverse that charge too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me...\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me...\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, I was able to successfully reverse the transaction because it wasn't fully processed.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it happened on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I'll cancel the account and do the prescription for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're all set, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: So look up at Corporate Business Day, you will see the refund.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
