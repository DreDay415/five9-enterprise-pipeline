    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, this is Ed Vegas calling from Rochelle, Indiana. I just received through the mail a refill and I did not order it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me help you out. Can I have your phone number so I can pull up your account?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, seven six five four three eight. Oh—\n\nSpeaker 1: Seven seven five.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Ed, can you just confirm your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: One eight fifty.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much. I see your VIP status.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay. I see the doctor put you on monthly refills, which you do not have to have.\n\nSpeaker 2: And how's the medication working out for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's hitting, this is it, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay. Do you happen to have the pills on you right now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you take out an individual pill and tell me what's on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why is the bank calling me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Is the bank calling? Well, it's um—\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there AC on there?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay. Those are just regular generic Viagra. Those are not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pharmacy. Well, you know what, I called when I first received those.\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not think I got the right—and she has said, is it rectangle or round?\n\nSpeaker 2: And it is rectangular.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, she said that was the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wish there— I wish she left notes here because I would have told her no, you're completely wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, those are not. No, those are just regular generic. Give me a second.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm gonna get you out a replacement and then I'm going to tell you how you can confirm it's the correct medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give me one second. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sometimes the pharmacy runs out of AGV and then they send generics, which creates—but they don't tell us and that creates a bunch—\n\nSpeaker 1: Problems, so I've had the generics before and that's why I tried to get exactly the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly, and then I didn't think that I got it, but they assured me if it was triangle shape, that was AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, no, it says AC and the bottle says APCO.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Ed. So when you get this new bottle in the mail, this is how you're going to confirm.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the AGV on the bottle. It's going to say AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's also going to say Greenstone and—\n\nSpeaker 2: Greenstone is the name of Pfizer's—\n\nSpeaker 1: Manufacturer in France, and then on the pills the only number imprinted is going to be the number 100 for the milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And those are the two ways you can confirm because your bottle now says APCO—\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is the manufacturer from us and yeah, and they say AC, so just go ahead and throw those out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending you a quantity of 30 of them to make up for your—\n\nSpeaker 1: Your initial order and your refill, and then what I'm going to do—\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to go ahead and pause your refills for six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause it till July 31st of 2026.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because if I cancel now it will delete your profile and the pharmacy would not be able to send you out that replacement.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll give you my extension so you can call me back and let me know how the AGV works out.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a pen?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm getting one. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay, it's zero zero here.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to give you a number because you called through the pharmacy. Okay, so it's yeah. Yeah, 1-800—\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, seven five.\n\nSpeaker 2: Nine eight zero seven.\n\nSpeaker 1: And my extension is zero zero two zero.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my name is Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cool. Well, that's great. I think yeah, I appreciate this. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry, whoever you talked to, but now you have my extension and then you won't have to sit on hold either.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's great. Well, I'll look forward to that then. Super awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, they'll be shipping out tomorrow morning.\n\nSpeaker 2: They'll email you a tracking number, but you'll get it in five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, thank you Michelle.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem, glad I could help. Have a great evening.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks so much.",
