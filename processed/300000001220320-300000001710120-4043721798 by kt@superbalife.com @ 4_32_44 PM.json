    "text": "Speaker 1: Hey Gene, I did a couple things for you, but I need you to help me answer some questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing is I put a stop to any and all monthly charges.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the third thing is I put a stop to any and all monthly shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: But there was another shipment being sent out.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know what it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't see it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But when you get it, we'll have you verify it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: But I've got to ask you a couple things that were on your chart.\n\nSpeaker 2: And just answer yes or no.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it says something like, to this degree,\n\nSpeaker 2: has patient holder ever experienced any hardness and or erection within a 30-60 minute period?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to say okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, within a 30-60 minute period.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a while.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So has patient holder ever experienced an erection or hardness longer than a four-\n\nSpeaker 2: to six-hour period by taking the 50 milligrams?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then has patient holder ever experienced any adverse side effect other than any\n\nSpeaker 2: hardness and or erection within a 24-hour period?\n\nSpeaker 1: No.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So do me a favor.\n\nSpeaker 2: I put a stop to everything that you got in the past.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's two things that we need to be done, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: The first thing is when you get this next batch, and please do not get it confused.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get this next batch, it's coming in on Wednesday, the 9th.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just hear me out, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: When you get it, put a circle on it and put refuse, return to sender, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: What I'm doing now is I'm going to send you something, a replacement for free, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the replacement for free is for gentlemen like you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just like me, I take the 100 milligrams, but I'm going to send you 100 milligrams,\n\nSpeaker 2: 20 of them to make you whole for whatever you're sending back and for whatever you've\n\nSpeaker 1: got in the past, but we're going to change it to 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: And this is something that is very, very beautiful and powerful, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: But when you get a call from an unknown number today, answer it and just tell them,\n\nSpeaker 2: I want the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: The 50 is not strong enough.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because even if you take 50, two 50s, it might just not be strong enough or it might\n\nSpeaker 1: give you a headache, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: But this one is different, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to do that now, okay, while I have you on the line.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to say 100 milligrams, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be a zero cost.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to send 20, okay, to make you whole, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Please refuse that because I could lose my job, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't want to lose my job, but it's hard times right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as a veteran, you know, I don't have any place to go, you know?\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to send it, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do you refuse it if they put it on your steps?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what you do, Mr. Holder, when you get in your mailbox, write a big marker,\n\nSpeaker 1: write a circle on it, and then write refused return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then you just take it to a blue box, the USPS box, and put it in that box.\n\nSpeaker 1: It will take two to five business days for us to get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: When we get it, I'm already going to start the process of sending you\n\nSpeaker 1: a replacement now, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to send you a replacement of 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be zero cost, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm sending it to 75 Hollow Oaks Court, is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, when you're going to get a call from one of our doctors,\n\nSpeaker 1: just keep the story correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just say, hey, the 50 milligrams didn't work.\n\nSpeaker 1: I want the hundreds, the stronger.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I need something more powerful in my situation, my age, whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, just tell the truth.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just don't lie.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then I will get you those, and then I'll start.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should get 10 to replace the other ones, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll make it 20 to make you whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you get 20 of the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: That makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so that way you're whole.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please take down my name and number, Bud,\n\nSpeaker 2: so that way if you have any qualms at all, you deal with me.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have to be online.\n\nSpeaker 2: You don't have to talk to anyone else at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I take a lot of pride and honor in my work, Bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hold on, let me find a pen.\n\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know how it is, got pens around the house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, not only that, if you need a pen, then it can't write,\n\nSpeaker 2: or you get a pen and you don't got a paper,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you need a lighter and the lighter won't work.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pretty much, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got something to write on.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're right, the pen didn't write.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've seen that many times.\n\nSpeaker 1: That really pisses you off because you expect them to write.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you know what's so sad, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, that's what I'm going to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my name is, my initials, Mr. Holder, KT,\n\nSpeaker 2: like Kilo Tango or Killer Tornado.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name is Goodrich, as in tire.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And my extension is 0037.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now, let's recap.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, so let me recap exactly so you can put you at peace.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I did three things.\n\nSpeaker 1: The first thing I did is I put a stop to any and all monthly refills,\n\nSpeaker 2: monthly shipments, and monthly charges of whatever you got.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing I did is I paused your prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: and I was sending you a replacement of 100 milligrams\n\nSpeaker 1: of what you got before.\n\nSpeaker 2: The third thing is of what something more powerful, more beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 100 milligrams of 20 tabs.\n\nSpeaker 2: The third thing we're doing is you're going to refuse that package,\n\nSpeaker 1: so when it comes back on the way tomorrow,\n\nSpeaker 2: you're going to get 20 pills of 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the last thing is I set up a dashboard for you,\n\nSpeaker 2: so when you get a chance, Mr. Holder, you go to scoreblue.com\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're going to log in with your gthold at hotmail.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you do that, you're going to see a category that says your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: In that category, once the fulfillment is placed with this refill\n\nSpeaker 2: or this replacement that I sent,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to put a red button with white font that says quick refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you have full autonomy on your orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or you could just call me.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only caveat to this is we can't send you more than one refill per month\n\nSpeaker 1: legally, plus we're all sold out of the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everyone wants them because it is strong, but they can split it in two.\n\nSpeaker 1: The second thing is moving forward, the minimum refill is two refills per year\n\nSpeaker 2: or every six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's up to you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Click that, and we'll take good care of you either way, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's run this play.\n\nSpeaker 2: Please be on the lookout for another telephone call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please don't let it go to your spam and just let them know that you want the\n\nSpeaker 2: hundreds.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: I changed your doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way we don't have any more snafus, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that happen tonight?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it might happen tonight or tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just be on the lookout.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it comes like unknown caller, just answer it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You should be getting it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do me a solid, Mr. Holder.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you're done rejecting that or refusing that package, give me a call, will you,\n\nSpeaker 2: to let me know?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you so much, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: You take care and have fun.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.",
