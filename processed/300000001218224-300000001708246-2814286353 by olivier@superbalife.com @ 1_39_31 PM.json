    "text": "Speaker 1: I'm not sure how active he was, but, I mean, I know that he was paying attention.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, this is Vagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, this is Morris Thomas.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm calling to see when y'all going to ship my order and when I'm going to actually be at my location.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me see what's going on with your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Morris Thomas?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, so I see that. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, you are approved by the physician, and he was on the 24th, which is, I think that was what, Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 2: So they're probably going to send it out either today at the end of the day or tomorrow because the order was on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: The pharmacy is closed.\n\nSpeaker 2: So today they start working on whatever order was in the pipeline, so yours will be next for sure on the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and how long is it going to take to get to Anahuac, Texas?\n\nSpeaker 2: It takes two to five business days when they ship it out,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you're going to receive a tracking number in your e-mail when it's out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, they are going to send it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it going to come by FedEx or come by?\n\nSpeaker 2: USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: USPS?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's going to be in your mailbox, and you're going to have a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, you can't send it to my mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the only way with the regular shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: There is no mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then you need to change my address in, but there is no mailbox at that address.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so what would be the correct address you want to be able to ship it to, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it going through the mail and not by FedEx or UPS?\n\nSpeaker 2: USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: USPS is United States Postal Service with the U.S. mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not a UPS truck like you paid money for to ship something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why do you all keep saying that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know the difference between the two?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so USPS, the U.S. Postal Service, we're paying for them,\n\nSpeaker 1: and you get a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 2: They deliver it to your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if you have another address, I can update that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they're going to go to the mailbox, that's one thing, but there's no mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've got to deliver to rural areas.\n\nSpeaker 2: There ain't a motherfucking person that's had one in the United States of America\n\nSpeaker 1: that's got a mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 2: Most people that live in rural areas pick their stuff up at the post office\n\nSpeaker 1: or bring it straight to their house.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it comes to the house in your mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you receive mail to your house?\n\nSpeaker 2: There ain't no mailbox at any apartment.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm trying to say.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what it says on my driver's license where I live at\n\nSpeaker 1: and it has said the same thing for over 40 years?\n\nSpeaker 2: I live at P.O. Box 67, Attawack, Texas.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, can you send that to P.O. Box 67?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you ever heard of such data?\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, then it's not coming by United Postal Service then?\n\nSpeaker 2: It is.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is coming by USPS, but it's going to go to your mailbox, I mean your P.O. Box.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what?\n\nSpeaker 1: United Postal Service is a completely different entity\n\nSpeaker 2: and it costs you $40 to ship it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So don't sit there and blow smoke up my ass.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to send it down on delivery mail.\n\nSpeaker 1: So why don't you all just say that?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what do you want to do, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: You want to pay extra for a different shipping service?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's going to come in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Send it to the mailbox because I did not know that\n\nSpeaker 2: because when I get my other medications, it comes through FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everybody's different, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're not your other medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're a different company.\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you like to put the P.O. Box?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me ask you this question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you think it will actually get delivered there?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you speak more louder?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I'm on speaker.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm hearing you a little bit sound-wise.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's my damn.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm on a Bluetooth.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm on a truck driver.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you can do a little bit with that so I can hear you better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me ask you this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you sure they're going to ship it to a regular post office?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, it does.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the question is because you say you don't have a mailbox,\n\nSpeaker 2: which is unusual to this apartment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that accurate or you have a mailbox that we can ship to?\n\nSpeaker 2: Or you want to put that to the P.O. Box?\n\nSpeaker 1: P.O. Box because FedEx delivers most of my medications and my sensors and stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to come by USPS, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not going to come by FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's going to come by USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm talking about UPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm talking about UPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, we're not doing UPS, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's get that out of the window.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, that's the reason I don't understand why people say it's USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you're not in America then, are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: You're in a different country?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I'm in California, Los Angeles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, USPS means the United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: UPS is United Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 2: UPS is the same thing as FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've got to pay them big money to ship something.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, so it's USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: UPS and FedEx are different.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not what we're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 1: I keep saying USPS.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where it's going to come by, USPS.\n\nSpeaker 1: United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to come by the mailman.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the easiest way to say it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, the mailman.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, I need to ship the P.O. Box 67.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Anahuac, Texas, which is A-N-A-H-U-A-C, Texas, 77514.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, P.O. Box is 67, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and that's Anahuac, Texas, 77514?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, Mr. Morris Thomas, P.O. Box 67, Anahuac, Texas, 77514.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you spell Anahuac, A-N-A-H-U-A-C.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, and the billing address, is that the same 400 Lazy Lane?\n\nSpeaker 2: We should keep that as a billing address or the P.O. Box?\n\nSpeaker 1: That ain't a billing address.\n\nSpeaker 2: That ain't one of my billing addresses.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what would be the billing address that you want to have on file, if it's different?\n\nSpeaker 2: You can just leave it wherever you've got it on, because I've got two addresses.\n\nSpeaker 1: It doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, all right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now the new shipping address I'm having, Mr. Morris Thomas, P.O. Box 67, Anahuac, Texas, 77514.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you all said, sir, we're able to update the address, your preference for shipping.\n\nSpeaker 2: Once again, it's going to come by United States Postal Service, the mailman.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, in the future, if you want a different shipping, you let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's a little extra, but you can get shipped by FedEx.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't use UPS, but we have FedEx option, but you've got to pay a little extra.\n\nSpeaker 2: So what we're covering for you is United States Postal Service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just send it that way.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I don't get it, they're all going to reimburse me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, my credit card company is going to reimburse me.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 1: They'll reimburse me.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not a lawsuit against y'all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that the correct address for you, sir, the P.O. Box 67?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's where I need it sent to, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So why would you not receive it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because a lot of times they don't send mail correctly to a lot of rural areas.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the reason why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you know, that's not what we're wishing.\n\nSpeaker 2: We wish you to receive your order.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're not trying to have your order get lost or anything.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not what we're here for.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I don't like problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm 71 years old.\n\nSpeaker 1: I do not like problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get very upset with problems.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then I start calling lawyers.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, whatever works for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Whatever works for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I mean, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, like I said, most everything I get is through FedEx or UPS, United Portable Service.\n\nSpeaker 2: But no, I don't pay them anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't pay them anything to ship it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do not pay FedEx or UPS to send my medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's all done through my Medicare on that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have no idea.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, every company is different, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just keep that in mind.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everybody don't proceed the same way, you know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me ask you this question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is 100 milligram pills, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just making sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: And are they supposed to work any better than the Celestindale?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, Sidenafil is an active ingredient for any type of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now the difference is the way the medicine is formulated in the lab.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what makes the difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: But Sidenafil is a scientific name for any form of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now every lab, every formula is different.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's why we're providing a different formula, trying to help them, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully we can get better testimony.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everybody's happy, get a better erection.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what we're here for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: I used to do sleep depregation when they actually invented Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: At the United States Air Force there in San Antonio.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Before Viagra came out on the open market, the Air Force was doing the research on that.\n\nSpeaker 2: There's a research group over there.\n\nSpeaker 1: They used to pay me $100 a day to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Before they ever started making the pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mm-hmm, yeah, that's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's been 45 years ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah, for sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's been one of the most successful medicines ever in the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Viagra's a very good medicine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Levitra's not too bad either, but Levitra messes with your eyesight bad.\n\nSpeaker 1: With what?\n\nSpeaker 2: It did even back when Levitra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It messed with what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, usually the best one are either Viagra or Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: Usually are the both.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've never used Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never have.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've used 100 milligrams of Viagra, but I can't afford to buy them anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: They shouldn't be that damn high.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, that's why Pfizer came with the new formula that we have called AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: They made it affordable for everybody, and they improved the formula.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we have been a good help for a lot of men.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I've got a prescription for Schipendale,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I just need something maybe that will work better than that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I've got to eat three or four of them damn things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's give it a try, and I hope that we can be a good help for you, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now that I've got everything straightened out, I guess that's all I needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
