    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Olivia speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, Olivia. This is John Cassidy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hi, John. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Not doing so hot. I'm in quite a fix these days, but I need to cancel my score blue pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I can definitely help you with that. Okay, John, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 6-26-1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. And you're located at 13333 Fenton Avenue?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: In San Marcos, California?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah, so I do see your prescription here. If you don't want to receive regular monthly refills with your prescription, you certainly don't have to. You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to 6 months at a time, just because 6 months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the way that works is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can. You just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gotcha. Okay, great. So it's an open-ended thing if I choose to go back.\n\nSpeaker 2: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so just if you need anything before August, just give us a call. We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Pacific. Otherwise, the prescription is placed on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Thanks, John. I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm not going to be charged. Nothing will be delivered. There will be no mistakes or anything like that, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, your prescription is placed on hold until August, so if you need anything before then, just let us know if you need to make any changes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we're always here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Cool. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right on. Have a good day. Bye.",
