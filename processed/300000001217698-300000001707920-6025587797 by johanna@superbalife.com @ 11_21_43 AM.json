    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna C., how can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I think I have a subscription or something with you guys that I don't need.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I can check on that. Can I get your name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: Matt Moore, 3/12/77.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Mr. Moore, I have your account pulled up here. I see that you're a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Currently, your account is set up to receive refills every two months.\n\nSpeaker 2: As our customer, you have the option to modify the frequency or quantity.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can also put a pause on your account for up to six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want me to modify that for you or put a pause on it until July?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I want to be absolutely canceled, totally, no more, nothing.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't even know how I set this up, but I didn't realize it was reoccurring, all that kind of crap.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so we're not a subscription, like I mentioned. We're a telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the doctor wrote the prescription with refills available to you,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then as our customer, you can set up your account however you want.\n\nSpeaker 2: There are customers who love to get their refills on a monthly basis,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then there are some who only get it twice a year, and then everything in between.\n\nSpeaker 2: At any time, you can modify that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do recommend putting a pause on it if you do wish to place a future order with us again.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't. That's what I just said. I don't want to ever place another order with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now this is becoming more annoying, so can you cancel this for me or not?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, you're canceled. Have a great day.",
