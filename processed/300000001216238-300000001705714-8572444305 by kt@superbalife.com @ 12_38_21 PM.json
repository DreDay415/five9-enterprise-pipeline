    "text": "Speaker 1: Hello?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Sean Jordan, JT Goodrich here, one of the lead supervisors here with Pfizer-Score.\n\nSpeaker 1: Blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just talking to one of my reps here, and I wanted to call you and do the diligence and—\n\nSpeaker 1: Honor you, and I'll let you know how we can take care of you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I be of service, sir?\n\nSpeaker 2: What's going on?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to know about my shipment, because it was paid for for next day delivery,\n\nSpeaker 2: as typically, as it usually is, but the information that I was provided doesn't tell me if it—\n\nSpeaker 1: Was sent by ground or air, so I wanted to know what you...\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, what?\n\nSpeaker 1: I know exactly what you're talking about, and I'll show you how I can set things up\n\nSpeaker 2: with you, and you can follow the...\n\nSpeaker 1: It's kind of like who moved my cheese, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Where the hell is this shit going, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Excuse my French, but always going to be real with you, bud.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when I look at this, right, there's two things here.\n\nSpeaker 1: One, they put a stop to everything, they canceled you out, but then you ordered something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: When was this?\n\nSpeaker 2: So your shipment is in the express, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's in express.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you're talking about you're having something shipped out to you, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way to verify that, right, is you go to scoreblue.com, right, and you're going\n\nSpeaker 2: to use your phone, right, and you're going to log in with your Gmail.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you do that, you're going to go to a category that's called your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: and what I'm doing now while I'm talking with you is I'm setting up a blue button, and that\n\nSpeaker 1: blue button, it says track, and you're going to click that button, and it pulls you to\n\nSpeaker 2: the webpage of FedEx, and it says Monday, the 26th, right, before 8 p.m.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can track that there.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can give you the tracking number if you write it down now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so typically, though, when you guys send out for next day delivery, is it by air\n\nSpeaker 2: or is it by ground?\n\nSpeaker 1: This looks like, because the way it's set up with you and your location, this looks\n\nSpeaker 2: like it's going by ground.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and my previous orders, they were sent out by air, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, they were sent by ground.\n\nSpeaker 1: For next day?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, because your location, right, because you're in Massachusetts, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, we have a central location that's near you, and it's closer that way, so that's why\n\nSpeaker 1: it shoots next day fast.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's kind of like Amazon, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: They have several hubs in like Walmart, and in that hub, they already have stuff on deck,\n\nSpeaker 2: and when you click that, they're like, next days, and boom, because where the network\n\nSpeaker 1: is, wherever the network, where you are with your zip code, the 02151, it'll pull from\n\nSpeaker 2: there to get it quicker, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you didn't pull air, if you wanted air, we can do air specifically, but if we had\n\nSpeaker 2: the product closer to you on ground, it's faster to ground.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I was just under the impression that it would be aired to be a guaranteed delivery\n\nSpeaker 2: by today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so the way it's set up here is when I looked at it, it says Monday.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I'm looking at.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want it next day?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that's what I paid for.\n\nSpeaker 1: I paid for it next day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so when you pay the next day, you're paying, like, when you pay next day, what\n\nSpeaker 1: happens is FedEx says Monday to over promise, I mean, to under promise, just like Amazon,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: They'll say, oh, it's going to be there on Tuesday, and then it just comes tomorrow,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's under promise over deliver.\n\nSpeaker 2: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: I get that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it says Monday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so it says Monday, but you'll get it the next day.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you don't, we'll take it up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll send an email now to FedEx to ensure, and I'll file a complaint saying that we need\n\nSpeaker 2: this right away so they can elevate it, and then I'll put a marker on it, and that way\n\nSpeaker 1: they know that you're high priority for next day, and things don't get shuffled around\n\nSpeaker 2: and delayed, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and is there any way that we can just get this sent by air today so it can get here\n\nSpeaker 2: tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because it's already in route, and once Charles processed that, boom, we can't pull\n\nSpeaker 2: that back because it's already hit the process.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was a change.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, I get that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And there's no way to send out another order?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, because by law, we're not authorized to send refills or reorders in a 30-day period.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it kind of sounds like somebody dropped the ball with the delivery.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, that happens a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's logistics.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just got an email because I keep my finger on all shipments.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got an email that there's a winter storm coming up, so it's like we can't control that,\n\nSpeaker 2: bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's like even us, like you paid us, but actually we just pass that money to the courier FedEx,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then we step back and we allow these guys that we trust in them to do their job.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then what I'm doing here on your end, Sean, to advocate for you is I'm trying to\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm sending an email to elevate this, to put you in front of the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way you do get it sooner, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: But I can't control.\n\nSpeaker 1: These guys are dealing with Mother Earth, you know, Mother Nature, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's understandable.\n\nSpeaker 2: But that's kind of the reason why I called yesterday to see if I can get it today before\n\nSpeaker 1: anything crazy happens this weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what?\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're in Massachusetts and you just want this sooner, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Even if I did process another one, let's just say, hypothetically, if I did, Sean, even\n\nSpeaker 1: if I could, right, do it, we'd be at the same thing because I don't control Mother Nature\n\nSpeaker 2: and I don't control these carriers.\n\nSpeaker 1: And all I can do in this time is continue to press this email and advocate for you that\n\nSpeaker 2: you're in front of the line, on the back, and then this is elevated and you're a VIP.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you are, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And going forward, how do I guarantee that it could be sent by air, just, you know, as\n\nSpeaker 2: a preference?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a good question and I can't guarantee that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I can always put this for future preference, for overnight, for air.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that goes up to, again, where the location is, where that batch is, and where FedEx is\n\nSpeaker 2: pulling it from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because it's just like troops to the ground, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Wherever those troops are and the enemy lies is I'm going to pull from whatever troops\n\nSpeaker 1: are closer to the enemy fire to be able to strike back, if you will.\n\nSpeaker 2: That make sense?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I get what you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it sounds like, it sounds like, it sounds like you need it right away, but you're going\n\nSpeaker 2: to, you got a big day coming up, huh?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just about what I paid for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you pay for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And all we can say is that we're going to trust these guys' process and, you know, pray\n\nSpeaker 2: for these guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope that they return home to their families, you know, and you paid for that express shipping\n\nSpeaker 2: and we'll see what happens.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then we can always go from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you don't get it by your next day, then we can go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to take this up now with FedEx and chase them down.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what is in the closer hubs that you guys have, where would that be shipped from?\n\nSpeaker 2: That I won't, I won't disclose all those information because that's, that's our intellectual property\n\nSpeaker 1: and that's, that's, that's within our policies.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it was shipped from Kentucky, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's one of our locations, but we have hubs, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this, this one was actually shipped from Kentucky instead of the closer hub.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't confirm or deny that because I don't have the package in front of me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, according to the tracker, the FedEx tracker, it was sent Kentucky.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if it was, if it was supposed to be, if it was supposed to be sent from a closer hub,\n\nSpeaker 1: you know, is there a reason why it wasn't, or is there a reason why it was sent from\n\nSpeaker 2: Kentucky as opposed to?\n\nSpeaker 1: It always comes from Kentucky originally, but we have hubs set up closer, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: And it sounds like you just need it the next day.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what we're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 2: It doesn't really matter what hub we pull from, you just need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So all this other stuff in between is beyond you and beyond me.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you do is you need it the next day, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you paid for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that what you're saying?\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's all we can do is just wait on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's all.\n\nSpeaker 2: And see what happens, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I know you're trying to get in front of it, Sean, and I appreciate that's good.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's good mindset.\n\nSpeaker 1: Get in front of it before it doesn't happen.\n\nSpeaker 2: Then you really be, your gears will be grinded.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what do we go from here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Because we're just going to go in circles.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So there's nothing you can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I already did what I needed to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: What you can do is you can take the tracking number and you can call FedEx because they're\n\nSpeaker 1: the ones that's managing it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I already done everything on my end.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's off my hands now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you want to do that, chase that down, you can do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take responsibility for that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So nothing can be done.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what's your name?\n\nSpeaker 1: KT Goodrich.\n\nSpeaker 2: What is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: KT, like Kilo Tango.\n\nSpeaker 2: Last name Goodrich, Sean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, but I had a question.\n\nSpeaker 1: You ordered this, but you're not even with us anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: What happened there?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure what you mean by that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it says that you were, you placed an order, but there's so much going on with your, your\n\nSpeaker 1: case here, your charts here that I'm just looking like you went from Sidenafil Express,\n\nSpeaker 2: Sidenafil, but you order these on your own when you call in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that what you do?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just want to make sure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Why don't you just set it up easier where you can just get it on your own by clicking\n\nSpeaker 1: that button, the quick refill, and then you can choose which one you get it or just have\n\nSpeaker 2: it on automatic.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you don't have to keep chasing this down.\n\nSpeaker 2: I never had an issue before this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, you know, I would just call in and tell them, send the refill and that was it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we've, since 2024, right, we've been pretty good at it.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we do make, people make mistakes and carriers make mistakes, you know, it's just first world\n\nSpeaker 1: problems.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we'll get through this together.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're a team.\n\nSpeaker 2: We're all connected one way or the other, bud.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now you're saying I'm not in the system?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it means that you're, what I mean is you don't have a status where it's set up where\n\nSpeaker 1: you can click a button and just get it without calling in.\n\nSpeaker 2: I could set that up for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So when you go to your prescription near that tracking, what I talk about is I'm putting\n\nSpeaker 2: now this quick refill, so you don't even have to call in anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: It'll be faster.\n\nSpeaker 2: The only caveat to that is your, your, the quantity stays the same, 150, you can't adjust\n\nSpeaker 1: those quantities.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like you need it, man.\n\nSpeaker 1: You need it right away, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is a lot of pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are you doing?\n\nSpeaker 2: John?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 2: What was the last one you said?\n\nSpeaker 1: I said, you you order a lot of pills.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you do with all these?\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't see this a lot.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do you mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, you're calling in and you order, you've been ordering quite a few months, but what\n\nSpeaker 2: do you do with these?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just out of curiosity, man to man, because you're very out of question, just a straightforward\n\nSpeaker 2: question.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a personal question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I know.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what I said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Man to man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to answer any personal questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, this is a business, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a business, right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: So now you're making it seem like I'm ordering too much.\n\nSpeaker 2: What am I doing with the things that I'm ordering?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because everything we say, Sean, you're sensitive, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bro, you just asked me a personal question.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what?\n\nSpeaker 2: So what?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how I'm answering you.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's the problem, dude?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I got to report.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's okay, KT.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good one.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I got the call recorded.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're asking personal questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're asking personal questions.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're out of line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't authorize that you record me, so it doesn't stick.\n\nSpeaker 1: That doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got issues.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we love you, but please.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So that's how you're talking to your customers, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to answer you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: You do that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, and I'll report you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your customer service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll live.\n\nSpeaker 1: You'll live.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
