    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, thank you for calling Viagra at Scoreblue. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi, how's it going? Can you guys look up my account? I have—\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw my bank account that you guys charged me for some stuff that I didn't order.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I haven't received anything yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, interesting. Let's take a look here, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I get your full name and date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Tim McDuffie, M-C-D-U-F-F-I-E, 12-21-1967.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's my email address.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Tim, I'm looking at your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: It looks like you called in back in September—\n\nSpeaker 1: And placed an order for the 100 milligram Viagra AGV,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you were speaking with a representative named Shante.\n\nSpeaker 1: She put the order in and it looks like you guys agreed to put in a delay on it until January,\n\nSpeaker 2: and I believe that was the refill that went through.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why you saw that charge.\n\nSpeaker 2: It appears that that order was just delivered today in the mailbox.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right. I'm going to check it out.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What do I have on the account for right now? Nothing?\n\nSpeaker 2: So right now, you have multiple ways you could go.\n\nSpeaker 1: You could keep it on this schedule, which is every five months for a quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could pause it for six months, and that is the maximum we can do to keep it active,\n\nSpeaker 1: or you could even do it monthly.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you get 10 of them, and how much is that, 60?\n\nSpeaker 1: $63.95 for 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just leave it at that. Five months is fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: I forgot about it, so sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No, you're fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, man. Do you guys still sell those yellow ones? What are they called?\n\nSpeaker 2: Cialis?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, Cialis. Do you guys still sell those?\n\nSpeaker 2: We do sell Cialis, but it is a bit pricey. Those are about $10 a pill.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I prefer, actually, I've tried both now, and I think I like the Cialis better.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would rather do a, what was I doing a while ago back?\n\nSpeaker 1: I was spending like $150 every five, six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so those were a lower dose Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: We had a special at that time. You were doing 24, 20-milligram Cialis for $158.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you have a higher Cialis these days?\n\nSpeaker 1: 20-milligram, you mean quantity or milligram dosage?\n\nSpeaker 2: Milligram.\n\nSpeaker 1: 20 milligrams is legally the largest milligram dosage they can do that's FDA approved,\n\nSpeaker 2: so they don't make anything bigger than 20.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, because you were just saying I was getting a lower dosage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Lower dosage?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you say that, or was I, I was getting a 20, wasn't I?\n\nSpeaker 2: You were getting 24 of 20 milligrams of the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: What was I, and I was getting 24, how many months at a time was I getting that?\n\nSpeaker 2: You were getting that every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can we go back to that? I like that, the yellow pill, way better than the one you guys sent me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Yeah, let me go ahead and adjust this, so we'll go ahead and do the generic daily Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: And how much does that cost?\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I tried those out, and, you know, they made me feel kind of weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think my body's used to the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, I can honor your, the same pricing here.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that would be 24, 20 milligram Cialis at 159.\n\nSpeaker 2: For every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me use the ones you sent today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So it's end of January, so February, March, so what, end of April, send me, do that deal?\n\nSpeaker 1: So when I change your prescription over, it will put an order in.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I would just, yeah, so if you want that at a later date, I would advise you give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Otherwise, I could place the order today.\n\nSpeaker 2: If I place the order today, it would change the script over, but that order would go through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: So then leave it as is, and then I'll call back, and when I'm ready, I'll call you guys back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: And if you could cancel that five-month thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Five months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'll just cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll call back soon.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did have a bunch of them stocked up, and I am starting to get low.\n\nSpeaker 1: So those are the ones I like, and those are the ones I want to get.\n\nSpeaker 2: So let me look at how many I have left, and then we'll go from there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, you got it.\n\nSpeaker 2: You got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm taking notes here that you're going to call back here in a few months to adjust it\n\nSpeaker 2: over to the Cialis.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Get rid of that other one completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I still have a few left.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you know what I do?\n\nSpeaker 1: I go to the Cialis every time, because those white ones that you guys sent me, they're—\n\nSpeaker 2: a lot stronger, and they made me kind of feel weird.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, interesting.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, I think my body's just used to that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everyone's different.\n\nSpeaker 2: Everybody's different.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I appreciate it, and cancel that, and I'll call back, and I'll see how many I have left.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, you got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I was just wondering what was going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Happy to help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye.",
