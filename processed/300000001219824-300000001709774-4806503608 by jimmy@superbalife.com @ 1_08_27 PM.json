    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Hey, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Richard Valencia, and I would like to cancel my prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Let me see if I can locate you, Richard, see what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Richard, I do have you up.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you are VIP with us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me go ahead and take care of your request.\n\nSpeaker 2: I do see that you're currently getting your Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you're getting 100 milligrams, 10 every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can I ask you why do you want to cancel, if you don't mind?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's because I'm on Social Security, and I can't no longer afford it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I can appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I can do for you, Richard, to keep your subscription active, we can pause it.\n\nSpeaker 2: We don't have to just totally cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, therefore, that allows you to kind of order it when you want,\n\nSpeaker 2: so you don't get them every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I totally appreciate that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I can, like, postpone, like, any future orders and put you on, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: a every, like, five-month situation, so it's not coming every month.\n\nSpeaker 2: Your next order will be, like, five months from now, and if that's too soon,\n\nSpeaker 1: you can always call, like you're calling now, and just say, hey, push them out a few months,\n\nSpeaker 2: or if you ever want to order before then, you can actually call and order before then,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it'll be in a five-month interval.\n\nSpeaker 2: What that does, that allows you to keep your prescription, and it'll keep you\n\nSpeaker 1: at the discounted price that you're getting, because I do know if you just cancel it all\n\nSpeaker 2: together and decide to order in the future, it's going to be, like,\n\nSpeaker 1: almost three times more than what you're paying,\n\nSpeaker 2: because the Viagra comes from the labs in France, and the tariff hasn't quite hit yet,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I do know that's coming down the line, and individuals that have a prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: on file already, they're not going to be affected.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, like I said, again, I can postpone any future orders for, like,\n\nSpeaker 2: five months and have it at five-month intervals, so you're not getting them every month,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then if five months come too soon, you can always call us, like you're doing now,\n\nSpeaker 2: and say, hey, push me back a few more months, I'm not ready for them yet,\n\nSpeaker 1: or if you want to before then, there'll be no problem to order and get them\n\nSpeaker 2: at this discounted rate at your convenience.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I do that for you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, let's go ahead and do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: We can probably do five months.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hopefully, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, and I'll give you the dates, too, so you can have an idea.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, again, if that comes too soon, you can just call us and say,\n\nSpeaker 1: push me out another few months, and we can do that for you with no problem.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, you're looking at June 23rd, and then it'll be every five months after that,\n\nSpeaker 1: but you can always kind of, you're in more control of it,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's not coming every month at this point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I'll just take care of it for you, Richard.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day, there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
