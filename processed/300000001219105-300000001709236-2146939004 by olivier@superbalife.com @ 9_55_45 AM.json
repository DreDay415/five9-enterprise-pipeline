    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright, Mr. Saul Olvera?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: You don't have a subscription, you have a prescription from Dr. Wright for Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: 15 mg, 10 tablets, every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you don't need it as often, Mr. Olvera, we can advise the pharmacy to pause.\n\nSpeaker 2: They're not going to go based on the initial written prescription or every 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that means you're just going to order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because you don't have to get it as often if you don't need it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The doctors just wrote it because you get 10 pills every 30 days in a month,\n\nSpeaker 2: so we're assuming that you're active.\n\nSpeaker 1: If that's the case, we tell the pharmacy to stop the 30-day initial prescription\n\nSpeaker 2: and you order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can let us know if you want it every 90 days, 2 months, or we pause you up to half a year\n\nSpeaker 2: and you can just reorder, get your pill once or twice a year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the problem is it's not helping and I'm getting cash every month,\n\nSpeaker 2: so I don't know if it's not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, it's just a prescription with refills wrote by the doctor.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I'm going to stop, tell the pharmacy to stop so you don't get the monthly, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And you just order as needed.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you said you didn't get the result that you want,\n\nSpeaker 1: but did you get a little bit of erection, but you're just not sustaining it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it didn't help anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: I even took two of them so it can be 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: I still got like two bottles new because I was trying to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Most of the places, they will let you cancel it online, but I had to call.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to tell the pharmacy to stop sending on the 30 days.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going to pause you and I'm going to have the pharmacy send you also an activator.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's free, it's one time.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a supplement to go with the Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 2: If you have resistance, we have a supplement to try to help the Viagra take a full effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's called an activator, like activation.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you can activate your Viagra with that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And maybe we can get you a better kick so you can get better results.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's good that you took two of them, so 100.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the maximum. Don't take more than that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then we're going to send you the activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you got to keep micro-dosing it because sometimes, based on your health history,\n\nSpeaker 2: some people have a system which is more slow, meaning that the medication takes time to take its full effect.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if you micro-dose it, you keep taking it, at some point you're going to see that things increasing\n\nSpeaker 2: because your body is matching with the chemistry of that medication.\n\nSpeaker 1: You see what I'm saying?\n\nSpeaker 2: The body is adapting to the way the medication works.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the body is going to obey what the medication wants you to do as far as getting the blood flow down there.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because a lot of people don't know that.\n\nSpeaker 2: When you have ED, they think it's just a miracle.\n\nSpeaker 1: You just take one thing one day, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But it's a little bit of a process sometimes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to tell the pharmacy to stop the 30 days, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: They're going to pause your prescription, and we're going to send you what we call an activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, if you like it, you can get it yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can Google it on Amazon.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will find it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But you're entitled to that one time free with your purchase, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I just don't want to get a...\n\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm stopping that, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have nothing to worry.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm stopping that for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, you can get your pill once or twice a year to lock your price in,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the doctor consultation is still available to you at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: If you want to order sooner or log into your account, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm going to try to send you a little bit of support, a little bit of help with the activator, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give me one moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm sending you activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: I sent you an activator, and we paused the prescription, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: For half a year, you can reorder.\n\nSpeaker 1: Press your quick refill button.\n\nSpeaker 2: Call us, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And we're going to help you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're all set for now, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: And then a low-carb business day, you're going to get the activator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take two on an empty stomach for three, four, five days,\n\nSpeaker 2: and then take it and take the Viagra on the same day.\n\nSpeaker 1: 60 capsules is one month supply.\n\nSpeaker 2: It should improve your blood flow and everything.\n\nSpeaker 1: In general, if you can do less caffeine, I'm not sure if you're drinking,\n\nSpeaker 2: if you can drink.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can do less alcohol and also have a lighter diet at night\n\nSpeaker 2: because the blood flow gets impacted a lot at night.\n\nSpeaker 1: When you eat heavy, you eat in the evening, it tends to sit in your system,\n\nSpeaker 2: and, you know, the blood flow is more impacted.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you want to improve blood flow,\n\nSpeaker 2: and the Viagra is going to trigger the blood to go in the right part for you, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you need a better erection, you know what I mean?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: For now, everything is great.\n\nSpeaker 1: You look good, and you have a good weekend.\n\nSpeaker 2: Give us a call.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're welcome.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good one, sir.",
