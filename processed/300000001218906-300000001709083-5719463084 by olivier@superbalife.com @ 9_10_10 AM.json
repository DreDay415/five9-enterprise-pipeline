I would like to, you know, locate the charges of my account.\n\nSpeaker 1: If there is an existing or active subscription, it will be much appreciated if you could help me.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. May I have the phone number you used for your prescription?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, of course. It's 951-973-9387.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what's your name, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, name's Richard Najjar.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why would you need my date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's one of the criteria to verify an account for a patient.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you provide your date of birth that we need to verify for your account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, is that too personal?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, because we have it, sir. I'm not asking you to provide something we don't have.\n\nSpeaker 2: We have it. I just got to confirm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, really? Is there any way that you can let me know if you just wanted to check if it's active or not?\n\nSpeaker 2: Like I said, I need to verify because, you know, it's medical information, sir. It's telehealth.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to verify and make sure I'm talking to the patient in order to provide personal information of the account.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay. There's no other way, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, that's one of the criteria.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll think about it. Then I'll give it a call back once I have decided.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right. Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.",
