    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. This is Jimmy. How can I help you today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Jimmy, this is Mr. Chanda. I recently placed an order for Viagra AGV through Facebook.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I did not receive Viagra AGV. I just got the generic Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: As you well know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I have your order.\n\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like that you are getting the Viagra 50 milligrams, 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: And you tried to get the AGV. Obviously, I see that you did get the generic Viagra, not the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I can take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: I also noticed you got the 50 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you want to stick with the 50 or did you want to try the 100?\n\nSpeaker 2: I would love to try the 100 if there's no up in price.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, there's not. I can take care of that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go ahead and get you 10 of those shipped out to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, it looks like that you ordered 20 of them.\n\nSpeaker 2: You did the upgrade for the 10. So I'll get you 20 sent to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that's what you paid for, that's what you wanted.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we're going to take care of that for you, all right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Definitely one second.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you going to send me an e-mail confirmation, Jimmy?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm going to – you should get an e-mail from the pharmacy when they go out, just like last time.\n\nSpeaker 2: And basically, I just want to confirm the address is 4110 East – is that Yappe, Y-A-W-E-P-E Street?\n\nSpeaker 1: Y-A-W-E-P-E. It's Yaweepie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yaweepie. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's an Indian name, it sounds like, but I didn't know how to pronounce it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, well, it was like when I got this order, man.\n\nSpeaker 2: I was all excited, and then I read what it got, and I started to Yaweepie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I got you.\n\nSpeaker 2: But this time you're going to get the correct one.\n\nSpeaker 1: And let me just explain to you real quick and ask the difference.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to come in the same label of the other product that you received,\n\nSpeaker 1: but the actual pill is going to be different.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to be a white-shaped diamond pill with the number 100 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to be a totally different reaction to the pill.\n\nSpeaker 2: The newest, latest, and greatest one, you're going to see a major difference when you try these.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because I got to tell you something, Jimmy, and you should pass this up the chain.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: The advertisement, and I'm looking at it right now, shows on the label of the prescription Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that is not what's on the label of the bottle you sent me.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, it's not going to be on that bottle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because basically, that's what I'm trying to tell you.\n\nSpeaker 2: The bottle's not going to have that on the label, but the pill is going to be the one.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's what I'm trying to tell you how the pill's going to look.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's going to have the number 100 on the back, and that's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's for the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's for the 100 milligrams.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's what the 100 on the pill stands for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is that correct?\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: If it was the AGV 50, it would have the number 50 on the back.\n\nSpeaker 1: But yours is going to be, right now, it's going to have 100.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's how you're going to know it's the AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me recap, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 2: One, you're sending me a prescription of 20 Viagra AGV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I've got to tell you, because as you well know, you go online.\n\nSpeaker 2: You have a Facebook account, whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: I could get 10 regular Viagra for $7.\n\nSpeaker 2: I totally understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's why, you know, when I go to…\n\nSpeaker 2: Why I'm telling you that is that's why I wanted the AGV,\n\nSpeaker 1: because of the upgrades in the quickness of response and the duration.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, Viagra has always been known for you got a good response\n\nSpeaker 1: within an hour or so, but it was gone within a couple of hours.\n\nSpeaker 2: I understand.\n\nSpeaker 1: I totally get it.\n\nSpeaker 2: The new one advertises that it's a start, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: you get a response in seven, 11 minutes,\n\nSpeaker 2: and it's supposed to last for 12 to 14 hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is true.\n\nSpeaker 2: But please understand that the average is, like I said,\n\nSpeaker 1: it says seven, eight minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: It depends on your shape and your body weight,\n\nSpeaker 1: but it does work a lot faster than the regular generic Viagra,\n\nSpeaker 2: and you will see that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You will see that.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is definitely the case.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the duration thing as well?\n\nSpeaker 2: The duration as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a given.\n\nSpeaker 2: And they are guaranteed, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: If I have a problem, I should call back.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why I'm sending you out these with no issue,\n\nSpeaker 1: if you understand my point to you right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's why we back it 100%.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Jimmy, I will be looking for those.\n\nSpeaker 2: What do I expect them in about a week?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, about seven to 10 business days.\n\nSpeaker 2: It should come a lot faster since we already have your information on file,\n\nSpeaker 1: and basically that's the case.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because, you know, she's anxious.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Lance.\n\nSpeaker 2: She's going to be happy.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: She's going to be happy, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: You enjoy it.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, Lance.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Take care.",
