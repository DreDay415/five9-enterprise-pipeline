You've got me on automatic refill, and I want to discontinue that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Steve Griffin in Lady Lakes, Florida?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Do you want a subscription number or?\n\nSpeaker 2: Negative. I got you pulled up here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It looks like you are a VIP member here, Steve.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you just not needing the pills every single month and need to pump the brakes for a couple months and call us when you're ready?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I could pause everything from now until April.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if that will help.\n\nSpeaker 2: Use up what you've got a little bit, and then if you need it earlier, just give us a holler.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can we just cancel it all together, and I'll call you when I need it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. If that's too short, I can go all the way up to half a year, six months.\n\nSpeaker 1: So from now until July?\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's go like nine months.\n\nSpeaker 1: Six is as far as I can go.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, I mean, end of July, that's basically.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I could push it to August if you need.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, August will work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll set that up right now then, all right?\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hope you have a great one.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: You have a good day as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.",
