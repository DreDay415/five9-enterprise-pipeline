    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi, this is Viagra. Hi, this is Franklin Deardorff. I just received a second refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was Viagra and I didn't really sign up for two refills and I just don't want it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I can fix that for you, Mr. Franklin Deardorff. I saw your prescription.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think from what I can read is that Dr. Tariq wrote your prescription with refill because your order, your basic order, is basically 10 pills.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what I can do is I can stop and cancel the 30-day supply and you can just order as needed. I'm gonna pause the prescription just to lock your pricing and preserve the consultation and the finance for you, and then you can just call to reorder because you're not required to get it every 30 days anyway.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can order as needed as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to stop the 30-day supply and pause the prescription for half a year so you can call to reorder, okay? And if you maintain just two refills a year, you're always going to be able to claim the price that you have today.\n\nSpeaker 2: Meaning that even if the price goes up, you're still going to be at the same price point. But...\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to stop the 30-day supply for you. So what is the price of this one today?\n\nSpeaker 2: $63.95, that's the current market price. $49, but then there was a pharmacy processing fee of $14.95, so $63.95. I guess I can't send it back. I mean, if you like, that can help. I can ask my manager and negotiate a discount for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: On that one because you weren't ready. If you like, you could do what?\n\nSpeaker 2: Negotiate a discount for you on that one if you like?\n\nSpeaker 1: I guess just make sure they don't send me anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'm pausing, but like I said, because you weren't ready, if you want to keep it, I can try to help you with a discount on it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so I'm pausing the prescription so you can reorder but not on the 30-day supply basis. And if you get just two refills a year, you're going to keep that price.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so do you want me to see if you can get a little discount or are you fine?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I'll take a discount.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, give me one moment. I'm going to place you on brief hold, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.",
