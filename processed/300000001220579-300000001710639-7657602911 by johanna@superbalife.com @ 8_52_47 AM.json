    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra. Joanna speaking. How can I help you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes, this is Glenn Hughes, and I need to cancel my subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, sir, I can assist you with that. Can you verify your date of birth for me, please?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's July 7, 1961.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All right, sir, I have your account here. I do see that you are a VIP status customer.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I just wanted you to know that we're not a subscription.\n\nSpeaker 1: So as our customer, you have the option to modify the frequency of your orders.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not required to get it every month.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you could set it up for every three months, every five months, every six months.\n\nSpeaker 2: You could put a pause on your account at any time.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way, you could still retain your VIP status with those special rates that you're getting\n\nSpeaker 2: and keep your prescription available to you with refills should you want to place a future order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because if I cancel your account today, it will cancel that prescription and all available refills.\n\nSpeaker 2: Did you want me to put it on a hold for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, honestly, it does not help me at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just like the other Viagra and Cialis and everything else I've taken.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I guess I just need to cancel it because I won't be using it anymore.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would like to, but it just doesn't help.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, and thank you for sharing that with me because I do want to address that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I want to make sure that you, in fact, did get the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you have the prescription in front of you?\n\nSpeaker 2: Would you be able to read to me what it says on the tablet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just one second here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: It says, well, I don't have it now, but it says in the pill, 100 mg generic for Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And what does it say on one of the pills?\n\nSpeaker 1: Can you pull one out and read that to me?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: AC340.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, it looks like you got the generic and not the new AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I do apologize for that, sir.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I will send you out a replacement of the new AGB.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, I just want to explain a couple of things.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Sildenafil is the active ingredient in all of Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: What makes the AGB so special and in such high demand is the modifications\n\nSpeaker 2: that they've made to the inactive ingredients,\n\nSpeaker 1: therefore impacting the delivery mechanism and how it releases in your system.\n\nSpeaker 2: So with the new AGB, you should not experience any side effects,\n\nSpeaker 1: and overall it's going to work faster and be more effective than previous versions.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I do apologize if the pharmacy made an error\n\nSpeaker 1: and sent you the wrong one.\n\nSpeaker 2: The one you have there is FDA approved generic Pfizer Viagra.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's not particularly anything wrong with it.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's just if it's not working for you,\n\nSpeaker 1: you're going to be really happy with the results with the AGB.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll go ahead and I'll send you a replacement order of 25.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've received two orders, a quantity of 10.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll send you 25 to replace those orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the one I haven't received yet, I looked online\n\nSpeaker 1: and it says still at pharmacy.\n\nSpeaker 2: I did receive the one, but the other one is not.\n\nSpeaker 1: The payment's gone through, but the prescription itself has not been sent out\n\nSpeaker 2: or I haven't received it yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll put a stop to that one and I'll send you the replacement order.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: I would thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'll go ahead and do that so you'll get that in five days or less.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: And hopefully that will work better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're going to be so happy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I do want to adjust the frequency.\n\nSpeaker 2: Frequency?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe every – well, let's see.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can always change it too.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let's go for every three months for right now,\n\nSpeaker 1: and then if it's not going to work then I'll have to call\n\nSpeaker 2: and cancel then or something.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm confident that it's going to work and that you're going to love the results.\n\nSpeaker 2: For now, I'll set it up for every three months.\n\nSpeaker 1: That way your next order won't be until three months from now.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then if you want to delay that order, just let us know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or if you want to place an order before then, just give us a call and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And like you mentioned, if for whatever reason you're still not happy with it,\n\nSpeaker 1: you do have the option to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I do believe that once you try the AGV, you will want to place future orders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I will certainly try it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'll get that sent out to you today, sir.\n\nSpeaker 1: How you're going to know the difference, because it's still a white diamond-shaped pill,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's going to say 100 on the tablet, not AC340.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's how you're going to know.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then it should say AGV in parentheses on the prescription label.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All righty.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you for calling in, and I can't wait for you to try the new AGV.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\n\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate your help.\n\nSpeaker 1: My pleasure.\n\nSpeaker 2: Have a wonderful weekend.\n\nSpeaker 1: Take care.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
