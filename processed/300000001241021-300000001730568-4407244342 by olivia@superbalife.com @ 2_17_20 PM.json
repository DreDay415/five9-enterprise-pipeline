    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Thiagra, this is Olivia speaking.\n\nSpeaker 2: Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 1: John Cotter.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hi John, how are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Good, I'm so glad to hear it.\n\nSpeaker 1: How can I help you today, John?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I just got another thing in the mail with some Cialis, and I called to cancel three or several weeks ago. I didn't want this. I'd like my money back. I'll cancel it. I don't know why they sent out another one. I stopped it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay John, what is your date of birth?\n\nSpeaker 2: 2/27/68.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great, and you're located at 8421 Celiana Drive in Strongville, Ohio?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Yeah, so I do see your prescription here. If you don't want to keep the most recent refill, you can definitely send it back for a refund, and you can always just do return to sender from your house if you like. And then if you don't want to receive regular refills with the prescription, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't. I don't know why they didn't cancel it when I called three weeks ago or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or four, oh, what? So we keep a record of all of their calls and who you speak with.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you know who you spoke with?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No, absolutely not.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because I don't have any notes of you calling them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, clearly they didn't do their job because I called to cancel and he said he would cancel it and he didn't, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I don't know a name. I don't take names down.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just assume people are going to, you know, do what they're supposed to do.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, I mean, if you don't want to receive regular refills, you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that works.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I try to do it online, you know, to cancel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It won't let you cancel online.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you just call us for any customer service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is what I did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which is what I did, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it didn't get canceled, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if I just put return to sender.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Yeah, as long as you haven't.\n\nSpeaker 2: So have you opened the bag?\n\nSpeaker 1: I opened the bag, yeah, because I wanted to.\n\nSpeaker 2: I wasn't sure what it was.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in that case, let me email you the directions for how to return it just because.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can you send me a label?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, but the directions are really.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I have to pay for the return?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the directions are really thorough.\n\nSpeaker 2: And as long as you follow them, we should be able to get your money back maybe even before we even receive the product once you have a tracking number.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, so the email we have on file for you is brownssuperbowl86@yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I'll give you a different one to make it easier.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it too hard?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I already copy-pasted it, but.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, what's the new one?\n\nSpeaker 1: J-C-O-T-T-E-R-86@yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, J as in John Cotter, like your last name, 86 at yahoo.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's go see.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm just not sure why I have to pay for the return, but.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's because, you know, we do have a cancellation policy where you can call in if you don't want to receive these.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, I just don't have record of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: It should only be a few dollars.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, I just sent you that e-mail, so you should have it in the next few minutes.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: You understand you have no record of it.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's not my fault, but okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, because you're saying if I hadn't opened the package, I could have just hit return to sender then, and it would have been free.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: That is correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not the flaw in the process, but okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I just return it to this address here?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, the Kentucky address.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I have to send via certified mail?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I mean, if you've already opened it and it sounds like you have, then yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Sean.\n\nSpeaker 1: So am I canceled now?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not going to get any more?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, you too.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, thanks.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye.",
