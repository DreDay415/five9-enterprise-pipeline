    "text": "Speaker 1: Thank you for calling Viagra, this is Olivia speaking, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh yeah, my name is Ricardo, I have, I've been using your guys for maybe for a couple months. I don't know if you put my information and you will know what I'm talking about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I can definitely help you with this. Okay, what is your date of birth, Ricardo?\n\nSpeaker 2: 08-28-75.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, 08-28, perfect. And you're located at 6922 DeMarco, Tampa, Tampa, Florida, 33634?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, so if you don't want to receive those regular monthly refills with your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 1: you certainly don't have to.\n\nSpeaker 2: You always have the option to place your prescription on hold for up to six months at a time just because six months is when the prescription would expire if we didn't refill it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the way that works is whenever you are ready to order, if it is before then, you can, you just have to give us a call to place the order yourself.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, and I have a question. Every time you guys refill my prescription, I got to pay $63 or, right, that's correct, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, so, yeah, so if you were to call back in a few months and order again and you were to order 10 of the same script, then, yeah, it would be the $63.95.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, yeah, right now, you know, I want to stop, I don't want to keep doing the refill or anything. I want to stop.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: No, that's totally fine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, so if you do need anything before August, just give us a call. We're always here Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 specific.\n\nSpeaker 2: Otherwise, your prescription has been placed on hold until then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, but for right now, I'm safe. I don't want no charges in my credit card, in my car.\n\nSpeaker 2: So I'm good for now?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm safe?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: No more charges?\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Your prescription is placed on hold.\n\nSpeaker 2: So if you need anything before then, let us know and you are also eligible if you want to take us up on it now or a later date is fine for a free sample of our newest, highest quality product.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, yeah, think about it and let us know.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the quality product you offer me right now is free, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Do you want to try it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, but I want to, you know, I want to stop, but I would like to receive if you like it.\n\nSpeaker 2: I keep going if you're not, you know, but right now I want to stop. I don't want no charges in my car.\n\nSpeaker 1: If we can do that, we go ahead and do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: But for now, you know, I'll wait till August to give you a call to, you know, to review again.\n\nSpeaker 1: But right now, if it's free, you know, you can send it, but if not, I don't want to do it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so I'll send you the sample.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's 10 pills and I'm going to send it to you at 100 milligrams because that's what you've already been approved for. Can I ship it to 6922 DeMarco, Tampa, Florida, 33634?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great.\n\nSpeaker 2: So you should receive this probably by Monday or Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yeah, just remember to take them, Ricardo, on an empty stomach just because if you eat with them, they're not able to work for you. And then you want to avoid alcohol when you take them just because alcohol restricts blood flow.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, and I just sent these out to you for free.\n\nSpeaker 2: The prescription that it started with that one, because it's free, has been placed on hold until July.\n\nSpeaker 1: So if you end up liking the prescription and you run out of pills and you need to order before July, just let us know. And if the pills don't work for you, just let us know before July.\n\nSpeaker 2: But I think they will because, I mean, they have really good reviews.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Sounds good, sounds good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, as long as you stop with the payments, I don't want to make any extra payment or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm good.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, for right now, if you use free samples, send it. And then I will call you July or August before the prescription expires.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay, perfect.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, it looks like you have a lot of pills, so I'll do August instead.\n\nSpeaker 1: So yeah, that's perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Ricardo.\n\nSpeaker 1: I hope you have a great day.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, bye.",
