    "text": "Speaker 1: Hi. Thank you so much for calling Viagra. My name is Jessie. Can I get your first and last name?\n\nSpeaker 2: Wayne Schwartz.\n\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And then Mr. Schwartz, let's see here, can I get your zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: 92020.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, perfect. Thank you. One moment.\n\nSpeaker 2: Are you at 2449 Boyington Place, El Cajon, California?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. What can I do for you, sir?\n\nSpeaker 1: I just made an order. And my understanding, is this a subscription I have to go with?\n\nSpeaker 2: No? It's just a one-time purchase and that's it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. So this is actually how yours is. The prescription is active and you can place an order at any time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, you know, you just pay, you know, order at will, on demand.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: However, to keep the prescription active, if you do not place an order in a six-month period,\n\nSpeaker 2: you are sent one refill for 10 pills and that's it. That just keeps your prescription active.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can I stop that right now? I just want to do it this time and then if I need to refill, I'll refill.\n\nSpeaker 2: I just want to make sure it doesn't hurt me or anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, absolutely. So here's a suggestion for you because once we cancel the prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: unfortunately it cancels the prescription altogether and you can't, you know, use the refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my suggestion would be try the pills first and then determine if they're a fit for you or not.\n\nSpeaker 2: If they're not a fit for you, by all means, you're welcome to cancel.\n\nSpeaker 1: If they are a fit for you, then at least your prescription is still open.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And I won't get any more until six months from now, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I won't be charging next month for another.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, no, no.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right.\n\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you very much. And who am I speaking to?\n\nSpeaker 1: My name is Jessie.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have a good day.\n\nSpeaker 2: You too. Thank you.",
