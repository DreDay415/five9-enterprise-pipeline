So it was a refill that occurred on your prescription. I can take a look at that here.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your last name and a zip code?\n\nSpeaker 2: Samerson, S-A-M-E-R-S-O-N, and my zip code is 12549.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I have this order here that actually did ship out on the 27th.\n\nSpeaker 2: You can always refuse that package, though, that way you can get a refund for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Aside from that, though, I do want to talk about your prescription,\n\nSpeaker 2: because it looks like the doctor currently has you on every three months, which is why you got a refill.\n\nSpeaker 1: I can go ahead and actually modify that for you.\n\nSpeaker 2: That way you don't lose access to the prescription.\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I'd like to close it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay. No worries. Just keep in mind that the moment it does get closed out,\n\nSpeaker 1: we would have to delete the visit and the doctor would also have to delete the visit.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: No problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you're also in that part, and just refuse that other package once it gets to your home,\n\nSpeaker 2: and once it gets to the pharmacy, they'll give you a refund.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what do I do with the package that comes?\n\nSpeaker 2: Just keep it closed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Write on there refuse, return the sender, and then leave it back in the mailbox\n\nSpeaker 2: or take it to the post office.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 2: Bye-bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye-bye.",
